The development model created study data collected organization contracted funded research
The term maturity relates degree formality optimization process practice formally defined step managed result metric active optimization process
The model aim improve existing process also applied process
The Capability Maturity Model originally developed tool objectively assessing ability government contractor implement contracted software project
The model based process maturity framework first described later book
It later published report book author
Though model come field also used model aid business process generally also used extensively worldwide government office commerce industry
In use computer grew widespread flexible le costly
Organizations began adopt computerized information system demand grew significantly
Many process software development infancy standard best practice approach defined
As result growth accompanied growing pain project failure common field still early year ambition project scale complexity exceeded market capability deliver adequate product within planned budget
Individuals began publish article book research result attempt professionalize process
In several US military project involving software subcontractor ran completed far later planned
In effort determine occurring funded study SEI
The first application staged maturity model IT rather published IT organization
began developing process maturity concept later stage career IBM
Active development model US Department Defense Software Engineering Institute SEI began Humphrey joined located Carnegie Mellon University retiring IBM
At request Air Force began formalizing Process Maturity Framework aid Department Defense evaluating capability software contractor part awarding contract
The result Air Force study model military use objective evaluation software subcontractor process capability maturity
Humphrey based framework earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed book Quality Free
Humphrey approach differed unique insight organization mature process stage based solving process problem specific order
Humphrey based approach staged evolution system software development practice within organization rather measuring maturity separate development process independently
The CMM thus used different organization general powerful tool understanding improving general business process performance
Watts Humphrey Capability Maturity Model CMM published book
Organizations originally assessed using process maturity questionnaire Software Capability Evaluation method devised Humphrey colleague Software Engineering Institute
The full representation Capability Maturity Model set defined process area practice five maturity level initiated Version completed January
The CMM published book primary author Mark Paulk Charles Weber Mary Beth Chrissis
United States America New York USA
The CMM model application software development sometimes problematic
Applying multiple model integrated within across organization could costly training appraisal improvement activity
The CMMI project formed sort problem using multiple model software development process thus CMMI model superseded CMM model though CMM model continues general theoretical process capability model used public domain
The CMM originally intended tool evaluate ability government contractor perform contracted software project
Though come area software development continues widely applied general model maturity process organization
A viewed set structured level describe well behavior practice process organization reliably sustainably produce required outcome
A maturity model used benchmark comparison aid understanding example comparative assessment different organization something common used basis comparison
In case CMM example basis comparison would organization software development process
The model involves five aspect There five level defined along continuum model according SEI Predictability effectiveness control organization software process believed improve organization move five level
While rigorous empirical evidence date support belief
Within maturity level Key Process Areas characterise level area five factor goal commitment ability measurement verification
These necessarily unique CMM representing stage organization must go way becoming mature
The model provides theoretical continuum along process maturity developed incrementally one level next
Skipping level
At maturity level process concerned addressing statistical process variation changing process example shift mean process performance improve process performance
This would done time maintaining likelihood achieving established quantitative objective
There company world attained level
The model originally intended evaluate ability government contractor perform software project
It used may suited purpose critic pointed process maturity according CMM necessarily mandatory successful software development
The software process framework documented intended guide wishing ass organization project consistency Key Process Areas
For maturity level five checklist type

Capability Maturity Model CMM broadly refers process improvement approach based process model
CMM also refers specifically first model developed SEI well family process model followed
A process model structured collection practice describe characteristic effective process practice included proven experience effective
CMM used ass organization scale five process maturity level
Each level rank organization according standardization process subject area assessed
The subject area diverse software engineering system engineering project management risk management system acquisition information technology IT service personnel management
CMM developed SEI Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh
It used extensively avionics software government project North America Europe Asia Australia South America government department require software development contract organization achieve operate level standard
The Capability Maturity Model initially funded military research
The United States Air Force funded study Software Engineering Institute create model abstract military use objective evaluation software subcontractor
The result Capability Maturity Model published Managing Software Process
The CMM longer supported SEI superseded comprehensive CMMI
The Capability Maturity Model CMM way develop refine organization process
The first CMM purpose developing refining software development process
A maturity model structured collection element describe characteristic effective process
A maturity model provides A maturity model used benchmark assessing different organization equivalent comparison
It describes maturity company based upon project company dealing client
In technological improvement made computer widespread flexible inexpensive
Organizations began adopt computerized information system field software development grew significantly
This led increased demand satisfied le experienced professional
Unfortunately influx growth caused growing pain project failure became commonplace field computer science still infancy also project became ambitious scale complexity
In response individual Edward Yourdon Larry Constantine Gerald Weinberg Tom DeMarco David Parnas published article book research result attempt professionalize software development process
Watts Humphrey Capability Maturity Model CMM described book Managing Software Process
The CMM conceived Watts Humphrey based earlier work Phil Crosby
Active development model SEI began
The CMM originally intended tool evaluate ability government contractor perform contracted software project
Though come area software development continues widely applied general model maturity process organization
The model identifies five level process maturity organisation
Within maturity level KPAs Key Process Areas characterise level KPA five definition identified The KPAs necessarily unique CMM representing stage organization must go way becoming mature
The assessment supposed led authorised lead assessor
One way company supposed use model first ass maturity level form specific plan get next level
Skipping level allowed
Although model proved useful many organization use multiple model problematic
Further applying multiple model integrated within across organization costly term training appraisal improvement activity
The CMM Integration project formed sort problem using multiple CMMs
The CMMI Product Team mission combine three source model CMMI designated successor three source model
The SEI released policy sunset Software CMM previous version CMMI
The said SECM model superseded CMMI
With release CMMI Version Product Suite existing CMMI renamed CMMI Development
Two version developed one Services Acquisitions
In case CMM combined methodology
It commonly used conjunction ISO standard well computer programming methodology Extreme Programming XP Six Sigma

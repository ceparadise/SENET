To layperson computer science information technology may seem like thing
In actuality three field typically associated study computer college level
Computer engineering computer science discipline within realm study
However specialty focus specific aspect field career within three area vary greatly
Computer scientist fact scientist
They focused theory computational application
That mean understand behind computer program
Using algorithm advanced mathematics computer scientist invent new way manipulate transfer information
Computer scientist generally concerned software operating system implementation
Like Neo The Matrix computer scientist see make sense code
Computer science student learn fundamental different programming language linear discrete mathematics software design development
Computer scientist study machine understand various computer process operate way
Simply put computer scientist talk computer
The field based language computer
Computer scientist understand computer work create program operating system want
Computer science rapidly growing field expected see large increase employment opportunity
High salary generally associated computer science career
If pursuing computer science degree following career path open To put bluntly computer engineer make computer part work together
Computer engineer responsible research design development computer equipment like circuit board microchip router video card etc
Some university may treat discipline electrical engineering
It beneficial computer engineer grasp computer science
Computer engineer often deal integration meaning design build processor hardware support given program
As technology advance device become smaller smaller main goal computer engineer create microchip microprocessor work economically efficiently
Computer engineering student study concept computer science engineering mathematics
By combining three field computer engineer able solve hardware problem create machine handle many task computer perform
There lot diversity job title computer engineering world
Diversity job come various industry employ computer engineer
You find employment rate computer engineer work Information technology IT may adopt moniker information system system administration
Essentially IT professional user technology
IT utilizes existing operating system software application tandem create larger system solves specific business problem
IT construct network established building block carry task automated supply ordering service
Due nature work IT professional likely interact client outside department
They may help explain client solve technology problem work executive business owner construct technology plan meet business need
IT student study network database design depth receive introduction basic theory applied mathematics
Successful IT candidate posse strong critical thinking skill IT professional tasked resourcefully applying tool disposal
At every level shop multinational corporation business need IT
Over next decade career opportunity IT expected grow faster average
Depending level education degree IT provide comfortable paycheck
To sum maybe oversimplify bit computer engineer design build computer
Computer scientist design develop computer program software application
IT professional use troubleshoot program software application
These three profession work together make sure hardware software user interface UI come together smoothly computer carry task business individual need
It might help imagine like Computer engineer architect construction worker
They design build house
Computer scientist electrician plumber installation specialist put light running water appliance house
IT professional live house use appliance effectively efficiently desired effect
There overlap within three field
Essentially exist subsection discipline performing complementary different task fit together like gear
Hopefully distinction three professional area clear

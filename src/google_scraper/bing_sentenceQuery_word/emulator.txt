In hardware software enables one computer system called behave like another computer system called
An emulator typically enables host system run software use peripheral device designed guest system
Emulation refers ability electronic device emulate imitate another program device
Many example designed emulate printer much software written HP printer
If printer emulates HP printer software written real HP printer also run printer emulation produce equivalent printing
Since least today enthusiast use emulator play using original programming code interpreted system
A hardware emulator emulator take form hardware device
Examples include card installed like allowed run PC software program
In theoretical sense implies assumption enough memory available operating environment emulated within environment
However practice quite difficult particularly exact behavior system emulated documented deduced
It also say nothing timing constraint emulator perform quickly original hardware emulated software may run much slowly would original hardware possibly triggering timer interrupt alter behavior
Yes possible Commodore emulate IBM PC us sense possible bail
Emulation strategy combat
Emulation focus recreating original computer environment difficult achieve valuable ability maintain closer connection authenticity digital object
Emulation address original environment digital object recreates current machine
The emulator allows user access kind current run original environment
Jeffery Rothenberg early proponent emulation strategy state ideal approach would provide single extensible solution designed applied uniformly automatically synchrony example every refresh cycle type document medium
He state apply date system also upwardly mobile future unknown system
Practically speaking certain application released new version rather address issue every digital object created previous version one could create emulator allowing access said digital object
Because primary use digital format relies heavily emulation preservation strategy
Artists specialize resurrecting obsolete technology artwork recognize importance decentralized deinstitutionalized process preservation digital culture
In many case goal emulation new medium art preserve digital medium saved indefinitely reproduced without error reliance hardware age becomes obsolete
The paradox emulation emulator made work future computer
Emulation technique commonly used design development new system
It eas development process providing ability detect recreate repair flaw design even system actually built
It particularly useful design system concurrency error difficult detect correct without controlled environment provided virtual hardware
This also allows software development take place hardware ready thus helping validate design decision
Most emulator emulate hardware operating system firmware software required desired software must provided well may emulated
Both OS software emulator rather run native hardware
Apart interpreter emulated binary hardware input output device must provided virtual form well example writing specific memory location influence displayed screen would need emulated
While emulation could taken extreme go atomic level basing output simulation actual circuitry virtual power source would highly unusual solution
Emulators typically stop simulation documented hardware specification digital logic
Sufficient emulation hardware platform requires extreme accuracy level individual clock cycle undocumented feature unpredictable analog element implementation bug
This particularly case classic home computer whose software often depends highly sophisticated programming trick invented game programmer
In contrast platform little use direct hardware addressing emulator PlayStation Vita
In case simple may suffice
This translates system call emulated system system call host system Linux compatibility layer used run closed source Linux native software
For example graphic processor fully programmable game used one program mostly communicated game via therefore many emulator emulate graphic processor simply interpret command received CPU original program would
Developers software often design software especially accurate emulator called trying real hardware
This software produced tested final hardware exists large quantity tested without taking time copy program debugged low level without introducing side effect
In many case simulator actually produced company providing hardware theoretically increase accuracy
Math emulator allow program compiled math instruction run machine installed extra work done CPU may slow system
If math coprocessor installed present CPU CPU executes instruction make determined interrupt coprocessor available calling math emulator routine
When instruction successfully emulated program continues executing
Typically emulator divided correspond roughly emulated computer subsystem
Most often emulator composed following module Buses often emulated either reason performance simplicity virtual peripheral communicate directly CPU memory subsystem
It possible memory subsystem emulation reduced simply array element sized like emulated word however model fall quickly soon location computer logical memory match
This clearly case whenever emulated hardware allows advanced memory management case logic embedded memory emulator made module sometimes integrated CPU simulator
Even emulated computer feature MMU though usually factor break equivalence logical physical memory many architecture offer even often block logical memory mapped mean module must discarded nature ROM emulated
Features may also complicate memory emulation
As result emulator implement least two procedure writing reading logical memory procedure duty map every access correct location correct object
On system memory address address memory rest RAM something along line following procedure would typical The CPU simulator often complicated part emulator
Many emulator written using CPU simulator order concentrate good efficient emulation specific machine
The simplest form CPU simulator computer program follows execution flow emulated program code every machine code instruction encountered executes operation host processor semantically equivalent original instruction
This made possible assigning simulated CPU
The logic simulated CPU le directly translated software algorithm creating software basically mirror original hardware implementation
The following example illustrates CPU simulation accomplished interpreter
In case interrupt every instruction executed though behavior rare real emulator performance reason generally faster use subroutine work interrupt
Interpreters popular computer simulator much simpler implement alternative solution speed adequate emulating computer roughly decade ago modern machine
However speed penalty inherent interpretation problem emulating computer whose processor speed host machine
Until many year ago emulation situation considered completely impractical many
What allowed breaking restriction advance technique
Simple translation emulated program code code runnable host architecture usually impossible several reason Various form dynamic recompilation including popular technique try circumvent problem waiting processor control flow jump location containing untranslated code time translates block code host code executed
The translated code kept original code lost affected way even data segment meaninglessly translated recompiler resulting waste translation time
Speed may desirable older game designed speed faster computer mind
A game designed MHz PC level timer game second might give player second MHz PC
Other program DOS program may even run faster computer
Particularly emulating computer change core system typical software may use technique depend specific characteristic computer ran
CPU speed thus precise control speed emulation important application properly emulated
Most emulator mentioned earlier emulate main device thus often treated special case consistent interface virtual peripheral provided
This result performance advantage since module tailored characteristic emulated device design based standard unified however rival simpler model well additional advantage automatically providing service virtual device used within emulator
A unified API may necessarily mirror structure real hardware bus bus design limited several electric constraint need hardware management mostly ignored software implementation
Even emulator treat device special case usually common basic infrastructure The word emulator coined IBM development NPL product line using new
They discovered using hardware instead software simulation execute program written earlier IBM computer dramatically increased simulation speed
Earlier IBM provided
In addition simulator IBM compatibility feature provided IBM computer program run legacy program written later IBM
This program used instruction added compatibility feature trap instruction requiring special handling instruction ran
The compatibility feature required setting console toggle switch support program
In microcode first used speed simulation process IBM engineer coined term emulator describe concept
In become common use word emulate context software
However emulation referred emulation hardware microcode assist simulation referred pure software emulation
For example computer specially built running program designed another architecture emulator
In contrast simulator could program run PC old Atari game simulated
Purists continue insist distinction currently term emulation often mean complete imitation machine executing binary code simulation often refers computer program used simulate abstract model
Computer simulation used virtually every scientific engineering domain Computer Science exception several project simulating abstract model computer system practically semantically differs network emulation
Logic simulation use computer program simulate operation digital circuit processor
This done digital circuit designed logic equation circuit fabricated hardware
Functional simulation use computer program simulate execution second computer program written symbolic language rather binary
By using functional simulator programmer execute trace selected section source code search programming error bug without generating binary code
This distinct simulating execution binary code software emulation
The first functional simulator written testing assembly language program later execution military computer
This made possible flight program written executed tested computer hardware built
Autonetics also programmed functional simulator testing flight program later execution military computer
Video game console emulator program allow personal computer video game console emulate another video game console
They often used play older video game personal computer contemporary video game console
They also used translate game language modify existing game development process home brew demo creation new game older system
The helped spread console emulator would unavailable sale retail outlet
Examples console emulator released last decade
Terminal emulator software program provide modern computer device interactive access application running operating system host system
Terminals many others longer produced physical device
Instead software running modern operating system simulates dumb terminal able render graphical text element host application send keystroke process command using appropriate terminal protocol
Some terminal emulation application include Rumba
Due popularity emulator impersonated malware
Most emulator video game console like Xbox Xbox One Nintendo etc
Generally emulator make absurd nearly impossible claim able run Xbox one Xbox game one emulator note nearly impossible due architectural difference console novel depicts human interstellar culture relies software written five thousand year Humankind ever left Earth
Its computer still run million million circuitous thread inheritance layer upon layer support
Down bottom culture incredibly complex timekeeping system example little program ran counter
find modify old software written hundred year ago one character state buggy solve modern problem
As computer continued advance emulator developer grew skilled work length time commercial release console successful emulation began shrink
console handhelds saw significant progress toward emulation production
This led effort console manufacturer stop unofficial emulation consistent failure Cir
opposite effect
According legal precedent emulation legal within United States
However unauthorized distribution copyrighted code remains illegal according international copyright law Under United States law obtaining copy original machine legal ruling Cir
long user obtained legally purchased copy machine
To mitigate however several emulator platform capable running without BIOS file using simulate BIOS subroutine slight cost emulation accuracy

I frequently see computer science
These two term seem synonymous
Is difference
Yes concept different
A system behaves something else implemented entirely different way
It provides basic behaviour system may necessarily adhere rule system simulated
It give idea something work
Think flight simulator example
It look feel like flying airplane completely disconnected reality flying plane bend break rule see fit
For example fly Airbus upside London Sydney without breaking
An system behaves something else adheres rule system emulated
It effectively complete replication another system right binary compatible emulated system input output operating different environment environment original emulated system
The rule fixed changed system fails
The system built around premise
All old arcade system long forgotten implemented almost entirely hardware firmware hardware system emulated right original bug crash would occur reached highest possible score
A model constructed something else reproduces thing feature leaf others obviously want preserve feature relevant query leave irrelevant one
For instance simulation commuter traffic leaf commuter name maybe even identity using counter variable rather actual set object disregard rate arrival
running software X created platform A platform B without changing software
This requires building model A run B obviously model everything A involves code execution
In theory could omit support opcodes know particular software wo ever use rare emulator hard work much worthwhile thorough job something reusable kludge work Both mean something job something else
The difference Simulation happens level respect user finalized typically anticipate result reality without touching reality
Emulation happens level purpose replace underlying component another different one respect work old one
In word happen parallel world happens replaced world
Technically something environment act real thing
Conceptually however important difference
A supposed detached real world certain degree output simulation directly connected thing simulates
For example aircraft simulator actually fly pilot actually communicating real air traffic controller
A usually testing predicting process safe environment simulation disconnected real world nothing really bad happen crashed aircraft simulator never kill real people
An contrast goal taking place real thing example emulate simple microcontroller using sophisticated programmable CPU CPU used place original microcontroller physically connected machine actually control machine like microcontroller would
The replace hardware software component functional equivalent original module available become expensive maintain
Emulation also serve goal using hardware flexibly programmable microcontroller double several simpler controller switching emulation mode needed
While etymology strictly accurate think difference sympathy I imagine must feel like empathy I know feel like
A simulation might include visual representation problem might
For example might print column number representing many people lined something total revenue average speed
It characteristic match reality
Emulation often used context one platform pretending another platform far complete
So Windows Phone developer run debug phone apps Windows machine emulator look like phone behaves like one
You run old Commodore game emulator
The word precise
Most flight simulator like emulator opinion name stuck time immersive
Some people reserve word emulator case reject anything else
You probably never thought wrong speaking understand people may place boundary two word little differently make allowance someone say emulation really accurate complete simulation
Both term much similar concept mimicking
Simulation Simulators make use software produce replicated system much similar target model respect underlying core functionality especially basic methodology
Emulators hand focus exterior similarity compared target system
It minimum concern function mimicked
Emulators general used working completely different environment For example different Operating system compared original system

Emulation software context use device imitate behavior another program device
Common us emulation include A common example last type emulation running Windows application computer
another example allows Macs run though addition Macs removed need application Macintosh environment future

In server virtualization emulation synonym virtual environment
A virtual environment also referred partition guest instance container

In hardware emulation use hardware imitate function another hardware device purpose connecting device one another connecting computer
Hardware emulation useful hardware device peripheral like printer scanner digital camera becomes obsolete
A printer emulator instance lie within printer ROM
In many organization legacy application persist must still communicate device
For purpose allows computer appear function like another usually older type terminal user access legacy program
While theory application may rewritten work another device architecture practice quite difficult accomplish successfully resulting significant performance penalty crash due gy programming

Contributing Writer Emulation try make one system behave like imitate different system
We want take System A something already give input would normally use System B may System A produce result System buzzword applied many different technology server storage communication network
An older seemingly related term thing
Here sort difference
What involved simple translation command machine instruction compiler interpreter done year
No taking complete operating system APIs function work machine never designed machine may use totally different method command
That even possible sometimes miraculous nearly always carry high performance price
Emulation entail high overhead significantly reduces throughput
If emulation take toll bother
Because might want one following Emulation important fighting obsolescence keeping data available
Emulation let u model older hardware software using current technology
Emulation let u use current platform access older application operating system data older software still think running original environment
The term coined IBM
Before referred hardware term preferred talking software
For example computer built specifically run program designed different architecture would called emulator whereas use word describe PC program let u run older program designed different platform modern machine
Today refers hardware software
Virtualization technique using computing resource device completely functional manner regardless physical layout location
This includes splitting single physical computer multiple virtual server making appear though virtual machine running dedicated hardware allowing rebooted independently
In hand server regard multiple physical device single logical unit
A virtual server carefully isolated software container CPU RAM hard disk network connection
An operating system application even virtual server computer network ca tell difference virtual machine physical machine
Virtual machine offer following advantage IBM developed virtualization big expensive mainframe could run multiple application process concurrently
During virtualization largely abandoned favor application distributed computing
Today server PCs however face many underutilization problem mainframe

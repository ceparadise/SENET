That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

In general reusable solution commonly occurring problem within given context
It finished design transformed directly
It description template solve problem used many different situation
Design pattern formalized programmer use solve common problem designing application system
design pattern typically show relationship without specifying final application class object involved
Patterns imply mutable state may unsuited language pattern rendered unnecessary language support solving problem trying solve pattern necessarily suitable language
Design pattern may viewed structured approach intermediate level concrete
Patterns originated
In began experimenting idea applying pattern programming specifically presented result conference year
In following year Beck Cunningham others followed work
Design pattern gained popularity book published Gang Four Gamma et al
frequently abbreviated GoF
That year first Conference held following year set documentation design pattern
The scope term remains matter dispute
Notable book design pattern genre include Although design pattern applied practically long time formalization concept design pattern languished several year
Design pattern speed development process providing tested proven development paradigm
Effective software design requires considering issue may become visible later implementation
Reusing design pattern help prevent subtle issue cause major problem also improves code readability coder architect familiar pattern
In order achieve flexibility design pattern usually introduce additional level case may complicate resulting design hurt application performance
By definition pattern must programmed anew application us
Since author see step backward provided researcher worked turn pattern component
Meyer Arnout able provide full partial componentization pattern attempted
Software design technique difficult apply broader range problem
Design pattern provide general solution format require specific tied particular problem
Design pattern composed several section see
Of particular interest Structure Participants Collaboration section
These section describe prototypical developer copy adapt particular design solve recurrent problem described design pattern
A set program constituent class method relationship
Developers use design pattern introducing design prototypical mean design structure organization similar chosen design motif
Efforts also made codify design pattern particular domain including use existing design pattern well domain specific design pattern
Examples include design pattern secure design secure usability Web design business model design
The annual Conference proceeding include many example pattern
Design pattern originally grouped category described using concept consultation
For background design see
Another classification also introduced notion may applied architecture level software pattern
Can unsafe implemented combination
It therefore sometimes considered
The documentation design pattern describes context pattern used force within context pattern seek resolve suggested solution
There single standard format documenting design pattern
Rather variety different format used different pattern author
However according certain pattern form become others consequently become common starting point new effort
One example commonly used documentation format one used collectively known Gang Four GoF short book
It contains following section The concept design pattern criticized several way
The design pattern may sign missing feature given programming language instance
demonstrates pattern book primarily focused simplified eliminated via direct language support
Related observation made Hannemann Kiczales implemented several design pattern using AspectJ showed dependency removed implementation design pattern programming could simplify implementation design pattern

Moreover inappropriate use pattern may unnecessarily increase complexity
Another point criticism lack update version since book published

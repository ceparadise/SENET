In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

It depends live
There rating system score one five learn software engineering rank company
Unfortunately I live ranking company really low application computer science le candid
Outside academia much going
Data science think would booming advent much computation technology however company hiring academia slide downhill student
I would try go school Silicon Valley get started possible
Still question

learn share knowledge build career
I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

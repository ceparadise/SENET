In style building structure element treat evaluation avoids data
It paradigm mean programming done declaration instead
In functional code output value function depends passed function calling function twice value argument produce result time contrast depending may produce different result different time called argument different program state
Eliminating change state depend function input make much easier understand predict behavior program one key motivation development functional programming
Functional programming origin developed investigate function definition
Many functional viewed elaboration lambda calculus
Another declarative programming paradigm based
In contrast change state command simplest example
Imperative programming mathematical sense
They may change value program state
Functions without therefore make sense
Because lack language expression result different value different time depending state executing program
Functional programming language largely emphasized rather commercial software development
However prominent programming language support functional programming also known used industrial commercial application wide variety organization
one world widely distributed language property untyped functional language addition imperative paradigm
Functional programming also supported like statistic financial analysis
Widespread declarative language like use element functional programming especially eschewing
Programming functional style also accomplished language specifically designed functional programming
For example imperative programming language subject book describing apply functional programming concept
This also true programming language
added construct facilitate functional style
The language also offer functional programming ability
An interesting case frequently written functional style presence side effect mutable state place grey area imperative functional language
provides theoretical framework describing function evaluation
It mathematical abstraction rather programming form basis almost current functional programming language
An equivalent theoretical formulation commonly perceived abstract lambda calculus preceded invention
Combinatory logic lambda calculus originally developed achieve clearer approach
An early language developed late scientific computer MIT
Lisp first introduced many paradigmatic feature functional programming though early Lisps incorporated support numerous programming style new paradigm evolved
Later dialect offshoot sought simplify rationalise Lisp around cleanly functional core designed preserve update paradigmatic feature numerous older dialect replaced
IPL sometimes cited first functional programming language
It manipulating list symbol
It notion amount function accepts function argument since language code data IPL regarded function
However relies heavily mutating list structure similar imperative feature

APL primary influence
In early Iverson created
In previously worked Iverson created used commercially financial industry along descendant
presented lecture Can Programming Be Liberated From Style
A Functional Style Algebra Programs
He defines functional program built hierarchical way mean combining form allow algebra program modern language mean functional program follow
Backus paper popularized research functional programming though emphasized rather style associated functional programming
In created initially developed language later language
Also Edinburgh Burstall Darlington developed functional language
NPL based first introduced work program transformation
Burstall MacQueen Sannella incorporated polymorphic type checking ML produce language
ML eventually developed several dialect common
Meanwhile development simple impurely functional dialect Lisp described influential classic textbook brought awareness power functional programming wider community
In developed also called type theory associated functional program arbitrarily complex mathematical proposition expressed
This led powerful new approach influenced development many subsequent functional programming language
The began consensus form functional programming research implementation release ongoing since
A number concept paradigm specific functional programming generally foreign including
However programming language often hybrid several programming paradigm programmer using mostly imperative language may utilized concept
function either take function argument return result
In calculus example function return function
function closely related function function allow function argument result function
The distinction two subtle describes mathematical concept function operate function computer science term describes programming language entity restriction use thus function appear anywhere program entity like number including argument function return value
function enable technique applies function argument one time application returning new function accepts next argument
This let programmer succinctly express example addition operator partially applied one
expression memory
This mean pure function several useful property many used optimize code While compiler imperative programming language detect pure function perform elimination pure function call always library generally expose information thus preventing optimization involve external function
Some compiler add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external function pure enable optimization
also let function designated
looping functional language usually accomplished via
invoke letting operation repeated reach
Though recursion requires maintaining stack recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative language
The language standard requires implementation recognize optimize tail recursion
Tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program compiling among approach
Common pattern recursion factored using higher order function fold unfolds obvious example
Such higher order function play role analogous control structure
Most general purpose functional programming language allow unrestricted recursion make cause unsoundness generally requires introduction logic expressed language
Some special purpose language allow recursion nonterminating computation expressed infinite stream value called
As consequence language fail Turing complete expressing certain function impossible still express wide class interesting computation avoiding problem introduced unrestricted recursion
Functional programming limited recursion constraint called
Functional language categorized whether use evaluation concept refer function argument processed expression evaluated
The technical difference expression containing failing divergent computation
Under strict evaluation evaluation term containing failing subterm fails
For example expression fails strict evaluation division zero third element list
Under lazy evaluation length function return value number item list since evaluating attempt evaluate term making list
In brief strict evaluation always fully evaluates function argument invoking function
Lazy evaluation evaluate function argument unless value required evaluate function call
The usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional language
Lazy evaluation used default several pure functional language including
argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity easing independent implementation producer consumer data stream
Launchbury describes difficulty lazy evaluation introduces particularly analyzing program storage requirement proposes aid analysis
Harper proposes including strict lazy evaluation language using language type system distinguish
Especially since development functional programming language tended use rejecting invalid program compilation time risking opposed accepts valid program compilation time risk used Lisp variant though reject invalid program runtime information enough reject valid program
The use make manipulation complex data structure convenient presence strong type checking make program reliable absence reliability technique like free programmer need manually declare type compiler case
Some functional language based let type depend term
Such type called
These type system decidable type inference difficult understand program
But dependent type express arbitrary proposition
Through program language become mean writing formal compiler generate
While language mainly interest academic research including begun used engineering well
subset written Coq formally verified
A limited form dependent type called GADT implemented way provides benefit dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience
GADT available since version case class proposed addition language including Java C
Functional program assignment statement value variable functional program never change defined
This eliminates chance side effect variable replaced actual value point execution
So functional program referentially transparent
Consider assignment statement change value assigned variable
Let u say initial value two consecutive evaluation variable yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
In fact assignment statement never referentially transparent
Now consider another function transparent implicitly change input x thus
Functional program exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent
It possible use functional style programming language traditionally considered functional language
For example explicitly support pure function
inception
Amrit Prem added support Python well closure Python though Python relegated reduce standard library module
function introduced mainstream language
In lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style
In sometimes used simulate however anonymous class always proper replacement limited capability
Java support lambda expression replacement anonymous class
However presence checked exception Java make functional programming inconvenient necessary catch checked exception rethrow problem occur JVM language checked exception Scala
In necessary lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style C
Many expressible functional programming term example simply dictate use function pattern roughly corresponds
Similarly idea immutable data functional programming often included imperative programming language example tuple Python immutable array
Purely functional often represented different way counterpart
For example constant access update time basic component imperative language many imperative based array
Arrays replaced admit purely functional implementation access update time
Therefore purely functional data structure used language may efficient tool especially persistence required
Functional programming different
The significant difference stem fact functional programming avoids used imperative programming implement state
Pure functional programming completely prevents provides
function rarely used older imperative programming
A traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list
A functional program hand would probably use map function take function list generating returning new list applying function list item
There task example maintaining bank account balance often seem naturally implemented state
Pure functional programming performs task task accepting user input printing screen different way
The pure functional programming language implement using derived
Monads offer way abstract certain type computational pattern including limited modeling computation mutable state side effect imperative manner without losing purity
While existing monad may easy apply program given appropriate template example many student find difficult understand conceptually asked define new monad sometimes needed certain type library
Another way functional language simulate state passing around represents current state parameter function call
On function call copy data structure created whatever difference result function
This referred
Impure functional language usually include direct method managing mutable state
example us managed reference updated applying pure function current state
This kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure function preferred way express computation
Alternative method developed track side effect program
Some modern research language use make presence side effect explicit
Functional programming language typically le efficient use memory imperative language
This related fact mutable data structure like array straightforward implementation using present hardware highly evolved Turing machine
Flat array may accessed efficiently deeply pipelined CPUs prefetched efficiently cache complex handled SIMD instruction
It also easy create equally efficient immutable counterpart
For purely functional language slowdown logarithmic number memory cell used mutable memory represented purely functional data structure logarithmic access time balanced tree
However slowdown universal
For program perform intensive numerical computation functional language slightly slower C according
For program handle large multidimensional functional language designed speed optimization
Immutability data many case lead execution efficiency allowing compiler make assumption unsafe imperative language thus increasing opportunity
may also speed program even asymptotically whereas may slow constant factor however may introduce used improperly
Launchbury discus theoretical issue related memory leak lazy evaluation give practical advice analyzing fixing
However general implementation lazy evaluation making extensive use dereferenced code data perform poorly modern processor deep pipeline cache cache miss may cost hundred cycle
Imperative program environment sequence step manipulating environment
Functional program expression successively substituted reach normal form

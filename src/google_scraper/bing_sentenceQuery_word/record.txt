What open activation record recursive algorithm
Edit Activation record number time call function finished yet
Correct
So find number activation record given specific input array say something general array dimension Or
Your question poorly stated except title
There single sentence really correct meaningful semantically
So I stick title explain wrongt text
programming language implementation concept
Programming language used implement algorithm program concept algorithm abstract notion rather concrete realization specific programming language
An activation record chunk memory containing usually local data necessary execute subprogram call name vary language function procedure method subroutine well memory code control flow
More dynamic part data used may stored place heap
Thus activation record number whatever
But number activation record use general correspond number call returned though necessarily true language see
In simpler programming language subprogram call well nested first subprogram returned last one called
Hence activation record stored pushdown stack
That apply control structure
Also may data activation record still used program subprogram returned
This happens example result subprogram another subprogram executed later I skip detail
So case one may keep memory activation record unfinished call
And pushdown stack longer work properly without specific technique handle problem
Last general concept
I idea input array program
So I answer
Many program array activation record
By posting answer agree

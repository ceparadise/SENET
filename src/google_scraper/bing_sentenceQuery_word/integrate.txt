Integral differential calculus set mental tool use solve problem world
It easy dismiss irrelevant learning problem book entirely divorced reality plenty application
Reasoning algorithm performance say primary purpose computer science find way use unexpected way job
You know saying hammer everything look like nail
It true enough good luck hammering bolt
The integral differential calculus set good wrench applicable every job absolutely necessary one designed
I totally agree example I make presentation example integral calculus used computer engineering could I talk
The time I recall seeing used CS undergrad algorithm course
We used approximation series hard work approximation probability
Those us expected course since integral continuous version series easy find event whose probability nasty
The sort probability approximation used applied probability class numerous place
If look CLRS Algorithm Design textbook algorithm data structure I sure see I talking
Especially look section approximation algorithm problem performance different hash scheme
All could put heading us theoretical CS
It probably least useful compared discrete mathematics algebra logic field
But many application integral calculus especially computer graphic lighting raytracing physic engine basically force represenatations based calculus also computer vision
notation try describe function scale compared input size grows use lot stuff found calculus like comparing function using limit derivative etc
Some advanced method use integral calculus example
Integral calculus also often used probabilistic algorithm analysis le often approximation algorithm
In used analyze asymptotic behavior mathematical appear analysis substantially different size
It generalization assumes equal size
It depends sort work
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
For application science certain type engineering used daily basis
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
One example I think top head calculating total cost carrying inventory
Let say estimated cost per unit per day essentially use integral determine total cost inventory period time
But right business application require explicit use calculus
I sure accurate I always viewed calculus necessary order force certain level mathematical maturity
If handle handle discrete math linear algebra IMO relevant
It foundation I guess
Summations crop algorithm analysis I ca remember using integral solve CS problem
Fouier series transform laplace transform use integral basis signal processing analysis heat transfer
The precise value math constant computer language provide summing large range
Pi e An integral curve give area bound respect ax
And many application lazy Knowing turn function polynomial function computer compute
Continuous time Markov chain important application improving performance analysis computer network devising better routing algorithm
Integral calculus used calculate probability density function continuous random variable Markov chain

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Many computer science program require two three calculus class
I wondering calculus used computer science
The CS content degree computer science tends focus algorithm operating system data structure artificial intelligence software engineering etc
Are time Calculus useful area Computer Science
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
I think course would need Calculus
I used bold face usually obligatory discipline Computer Science degree italic usually optional one
There may others top head
And besides one benefit Calculus course learning reason explain argument technical rigor
This valuable student usually think
This somewhat obscure calculus turn algebraic data type
For given type type context derivative type
See overview whole subject
This technical terminology let explain
You may come across tuples referred cartesian two type
We going take literally use notation b To represent tuple b type
Next may come across type either one type another known type kinda Haskell
We also going take one literally use notation b These named type value type b value type b value
These type look like normal algebraic expression fact manipulate point
In functional language common definition list given Haskell This say list either empty tuple value another list
Transforming algebraic notation get L L Where represents type one value aka unit type
By repeatedly inserting evaluate get definition L L L L L L L L L L Where meant sense repeated multiplication
This definition say list either unit tuple one item tuple two item three etc definition list
Now context context get value product type
Let give example For simple homogeneous take value get
But two different context type namely first second value tuple
So since either could write course
This differentiation come play
Let confirm another example Taking value give three different variant Depending put hole
This give u indeed derivative
There proof general
For final example let use list If take original expression list L L We rearrange get L On surface may seem like nonsense take taylor series result get definition derived earlier
Now differentiate get interesting result L L Thus one list become pair list
This fact make sense two list produced correspond element hole original list
Numerical Methods
There exist cumbersome calculus problem unique specific application need solution faster human practically solve without program
Someone design algorithm compute solution
Is thing separate programmer scientist
Similar robotics automation require quantifying lot human behavior
Finding solution proof often requires calculus
Utilizing advanced algorithm requires calculus co sine pi Especially calculating vector collision field meshing
Determining whether task possible risk involved possible rate success
Most security performed without calculus however many people want explanation prefer mathematical expression
The basic AI utilized without calculus however calculating advanced behavior swarm mind complex value based decision making
Visualizing health data requires calculus EKG reading
When working nearly scientific discipline requires calculus Aerospace Astrology Biology Chemistry Engineering
Many people programming go entire career without using calculus however prove invaluable willing work
For effective automation logistics visualization
By identifying specific pattern simply ignore pattern imitate pattern develop superior method together
The fact little chance ever use calculus
However virtually every scientific discipline DOES use calculus working science degree
There certain expectation university science degree supposed mean one thing know calculus
Even never use
It okay poorly calculus make sure put effort discrete mathematics
There lot programming problem discrete math come play ignorance principle embarrass front coder
Many people already provided application CS
But sometimes find Calculus least expect If know automaton pdf might worth reading
Some specific example To excellent answer I add point
In creating test case application I make use calculus predict expected running time memory size choose optimal parameter tuning data structure
This includes understanding expected rounding error etc
While statistic mentioned answer I would like specifically mention optimization algorithm based Mathematical principle include calculus
Specific industry I worked calculus required include Finance creating trading platform Insurance numerical integration insurance policy scenario compute expected policy loss Logistics optimizing consolidation transportation route Signal processing Calculus integral portion used directly CS foundation thinking summation
If work portion Knuth Concrete Mathematics section summation quickly recognize convention common calculus understanding continuous case give tool consider discrete
Many us CS study involve programming system monitor change case attempt predict future
The mathematics around system rooted differential equation linear algebra differential equation calculus
There teacher like Gibert Strang advocate moving quickly differential equation part still subset calculus
When change depends change system start unstable stable way well understood
To understand sensible linear system behaving nonlinear way either need tool calculus need problem space
And finally CS often requires reading understanding work others calculus first exposure lot shared vocabulary convention history

In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

In set symbol used organize object various kind object may referred name
Prominent example include Namespaces commonly structured hierarchy allow reuse name different context
As analogy consider system person proper name well family name shared relative
If family name family member unique person uniquely identified combination first name family name one Jane Doe though may many Janes
Within namespace Doe family Jane suffices unambiguously designate person within global namespace people full name must used
In similar way organize file directory
Each directory separate namespace directory letter invoice may contain file
In namespaces typically employed purpose grouping symbol identifier around particular functionality avoid multiple identifier share name
In networking organizes website resource
Element name defined developer
This often result conflict trying mix XML document different XML application
This XML carry information This XML carry information
piece furniture If XML fragment added together would name conflict
Both contain table element element different content meaning
An XML parser know handle difference
Name conflict XML easily avoided using name prefix
The following XML distinguishes information HTML table furniture prefixing h f beginning A name namespace consists namespace identifier local name
The namespace name usually applied local name
In When local name used used decide particular item alluded particular local name
Delegation responsibility party important application structure World Wide Web
Namespaces allow delegation identifier assignment multiple name issuing organisation whilst retaining global uniqueness
A central register
Each namespace identifier allocated organisation subsequently responsible assignment name allocated namespace
This organisation may name issuing organisation another delegate part namespace different organisation
A naming scheme allows subdelegation namespaces third party
A hierarchy recursive syntax namespace identifier subdelegation
An example recursive hierarchy
An example hierarchy representing IANA number
A namespace identifier may provide context computer science name term sometimes used interchangeably
However context name may also provided factor location occurs syntax name
For many programming language namespace context
In operating system example namespace directory
Each name directory uniquely identifies one file subdirectory one file may name multiple time
As rule name namespace one meaning different meaning share name namespace
A namespace also called name different namespaces different meaning one appropriate namespace
Following characteristic namespaces As well abstract language technical usage described language specific keyword used explicit namespace control amongst us
Below example namespace A namespace computer science sometimes also called abstract container environment created hold logical grouping unique
name
An identifier defined namespace associated namespace
The identifier independently defined multiple namespaces
That identifier defined one namespace may may meaning identifier defined another namespace
Languages support namespaces specify rule determine namespace identifier definition belongs
This concept illustrated analogy
Imagine two company X Y assign ID number employee
X two employee ID number likewise Y problem ID number used company
For example Bill work company X Jane work company Y problem employee
In analogy ID number identifier company serf namespace
It cause problem identifier identify different person namespace
In large document uncommon hundred thousand identifier
Namespaces similar technique see provide mechanism hiding local identifier
They provide mean grouping logically related identifier corresponding namespaces thereby making system
many modern support namespaces
Storage device use directory folder namespaces
This allows two file name stored device long stored different directory
In programming language
identifier naming namespaces associated enclosing namespace
Thus language namespaces nest forming namespace
At root tree unnamed
In namespace defined namespace block
Within block identifier used exactly declared
Outside block namespace specifier must prefixed
For example outside must written accessed
includes another construct make verbosity unnecessary
By adding line piece code prefix longer needed
Code explicitly declared within namespace considered global namespace
Namespace resolution hierarchical
This mean within hypothetical namespace identifier refers
If exist refers
If neither exist refers identifier global namespace
Namespaces often used avoid
Although namespaces used extensively recent code older code use facility exist early version language
For example entire defined within standardization many component originally global namespace
A programmer insert directive bypass namespace resolution requirement obtain backwards compatibility older code expects identifier global namespace
However use directive reason backwards compatibility convenience considered good code practice
In idea namespace embodied
All code belongs package although package need explicitly named
Code package accessed prefixing package name appropriate identifier example referred known
Like Java offer construct make unnecessary type package name
However certain feature require programmer use fully qualified name
Unlike namespaces Java hierarchical far syntax language concerned
However package named hierarchical manner
For example package beginning part package contains class core language contains core class specifically relating reflection
In Java others express semantic category code
For example C contains code provided system
How specific category deep hierarchy go differ language language
viewed implicit namespaces inextricably linked visibility accessibility
Namespaces heavily used C language
All Framework class organized namespaces used clearly avoid chaos
Furthermore custom namespaces extensively used programmer organize work avoid
When referencing class one specify either fully qualified name mean namespace followed class name add statement
This eliminates need mention complete name class namespace
In example namespace class defined within
In namespaces defined individual module since module contained hierarchical package name space hierarchical
In general module imported name defined module defined via module name space accessed calling module using fully qualified name
The import used insert relevant name directly calling module namespace name accessed calling module without qualified name Since directly import name without qualification overwrite existing name warning
A special form import import name defined named package directly calling module namespace
Use form import although supported within language generally discouraged pollutes namespace calling module cause already defined name overwritten case name clash
Python also support import x way providing alias alternative name use calling module In XML namespace specification enables name element attribute XML document unique similar role namespaces programming language
Using XML namespaces XML document may contain element attribute name one XML vocabulary
Namespaces introduced version onwards
Naming collision class function variable avoided
In namespace defined namespace block
We reference PHP namespace following different way In programming language lacking language support namespaces namespaces emulated extent using
For example library often use fixed prefix function variable part exposed interface
Libpng expose identifier This provides reasonable assurance unique therefore used larger program without
Likewise many package originally written reserve first letter function name indicate group belongs
Unfortunately technique several drawback Fortunately several advantage

A abstract container environment created hold logical grouping unique name
An identifier defined namespace associated namespace
The identifier independently defined multiple namespaces
That meaning associated identifier defined one namespace may may meaning identifier defined another namespace
Languages support namespaces specify rule determine namespace identifier definition belongs
For example Bill work company X employee ID
John work company Y employee ID also
The reason Bill John identified ID number work different company
The different company case would symbolize different namespaces
There would serious confusion two men worked company still employee ID
For instance issued employee ID would identify man receive cheque
In large uncommon hundred thousand identifier

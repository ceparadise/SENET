The External Specialization involves nine credit hour level
Absolutely CS course allowed
The three course must related
Frequently three course department OR IE Optimization I OR IE Optimization II OR IE Discrete Models
However great strength Cornell multitude interdisciplinary thread cut across departmental boundary
Thus Psychology Concepts Categories Word Meanings Philosophy Philosophy Language Linguistics Representation Structure Vision Language define acceptable Specialization
Not field created equal may challenge finding level course field others
Careful planning creative course selection especially important find field limited offering level
A student specializing Fine Arts example might find two level course offered department qualified take
That student must find third course perhaps one another field fill specialization
Another common example found field neurobiology much junior level work numbered level
Regardless departmental variance level course counted toward External Specialization
Finally mention course used External Specialization technical nature explicit connection CS
It arena wherein tap great intellectual resource University
The major elective course course approved CS major advisor
This elective requirement met multiple course totalling credit one course credit hour
Phys Ed course numbered ROTC course qualify academic credit used toward degree requirement CS
Six credit coursework academic program Cornell
mean justified selection advisor advisor approved selection
It make good sense use elective introductory course may required prerequisite technical elective course course used satisfy Specialization
Phys Ed course numbered ROTC course qualify academic credit used toward degree requirement CS
Up credit advisor approved elective may allowed ROTC course
Fifteen credit hour course outside CS
The course used category used fulfill degree requirement
Note It make good sense use Arts elective qualify course category
For example Psych Psychology Visual Communications Psych prerequisite
Psych could used fulfill credit Arts Electives Psych could used Psych Specialization

I working homework problem confused determine whether internal external fragmentation given following table More specifically design internal fragmentation external fragmentation
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
I found answer
External fragmentation happens time small space memory effectively employed
This lead hole everywhere memory
Therefore determined chart external fragmentation
On hand internal fragmentation idea memory space process
In chart internal fragmentation depends size
Since possible page one byte data larger page size internal fragmentation
Design spread answer
I know external fragmentation occurs memory problem le memory space partition multiprogramming variable
task called external le memory space partition multiprogramming fixed
task called internal frag
External Fragmentation happens dynamic memory allocation algorithm allocates memory small piece left effectively used

Everyone know mashup right
It two three song melded together create new track
You get mashups computing instead music Data pulled number source create new product
All legal legit
Google one first allow access code Application Planning Interface API meant developer could use code application rather writing developing code
The trend spreading site like Flickr YouTube Paypal many others sharing section code developer able select huge source code slotted application create choice consumer
A bit like supermarket heaven geeky Types
Those apps also mean I everyone else streamline Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yahoo YouTube social medium site single hub rather long list separate URLs
One problem using code always easy get mind another developer
If something go wrong code relying developer labelled code way make educated guess function
How le exciting important code source iFrame inline frame
This like putting small saucepan inside slightly bigger one code within code
You find iFrames used dynamic HTML form fill web page film video download onto webpage
That Netflix would use BBC iPlayer

When web browser load web page way appears determined information cascading style sheet
There three way HTML file use style sheet externally internally
Internal style sheet stored within HTML file
They easy work moment stored central location impossible easily make change styling across whole website instead go back entry change manually
However external style sheet instruction rendering page stored single file make really easy edit styling across entire website multiple element
The file us file extension link location file included HTML document web browser know look styling instruction
One document link CSS file website might many unique CSS file styling different page table image etc
Every web page want use particular external style sheet need link CSS file within section much like In example thing need changed make apply document text
This location CSS file
If file actually called located exact folder document linking remain exactly read
However chance CSS file titled something else case change name style whatever
If CSS file root folder instead subfolder might read something like instead The greatest benefit external style sheet tied specific page
If styling performed internally page website point styling preference
With external styling however CSS file used literally every single page website uniform look editing whole website CSS content extremely easy centralized
You see work Internal styling requires use tag since need differentiated tag However since external style sheet contained within file created like mean exact thing sample In example inline styling applies particular page evident fact contained HTML page header detail
With second example CSS info CSS file page link using code section

You may experienced scenario turn computer get black screen message Hard Disk Failure
Or dropped laptop floor screen go black computer wo turn back
More often problem hard drive
If hard drive crashed may lost document photo music etc
It one frustrating experience computer user
Read learn hard drive work simple step take avoid losing file crash
The computer device store software installed computer well data file created used software
This includes document created downloaded photo music
The hard drive form permanent storage rather temporary memory memory RAM
This mean turn computer file remain safely stored drive use next time start computer
There two general type hard drive use one rotating disc rely magnetic storage moving mechanical part use flash memory like kind found USB flash drive
If regular desktop computer likely hard disk drive
drive typical expensive laptop
Every computer least one internal hard drive store software data
If using Windows operating system drive typically called C drive
If using Mac called hard drive
If need extra storage capacity install additional internal hard drive connect separate external hard drive
Hard disk drive dominant type storage since early day computer
A hard disk drive consists rigid disc made material coated thin layer magnetic material
Data stored magnetizing thin film
The disk spin high speed magnetic head mounted moving arm used read write data
A typical hard disk drive operates speed rpm rotation per minute often see number part technical specification computer
The spinning disk also source humming noise computer although modern hard disk drive fairly quiet
In general hard disk drive robust used many year without problem
However hard disk drive fail one common reason
This occurs magnetic head scratch magnetic film
This typically happens result physical shock like dropping computer
When hard drive experience mechanical failure often hear grinding scratching sound
Such crash result data loss since magnetic film get damaged
It therefore always good idea backup copy important file hard drive
drive relatively new alternative traditional hard disk drive
drive moving part data stored electrically instead magnetically
Most drive use flash memory also used memory card digital camera USB flash drive
Since moving part drive much le vulnerable damage physical shock
The major downside drive lot expensive hard disk drive although price gradually coming
Despite cost drive quickly becoming preferred type hard drive certain type computer damage proof smaller regular hard disk drive
For example MacBook Air come standard drive using flash memory

The important characteristic hard drive much data hard drive store referred
A typical internal hard drive new desktop computer laptop storage capacity several hundred gigabyte GB one terabyte TB
How large terabyte
Consider typical song format order five ten megabyte MB
You could store approximately song one TB drive
Other characteristic important however
These include access time time take access particular piece data measured millisecond m data transfer rate fast data read written measured megabit per second
drive perform better hard disk drive respect two characteristic shorter access time higher data transfer rate
In order increase storage capacity particular computer add additional internal hard drive
This always practical often easier connect separate external hard drive
This like internal hard drive protected metal plastic casing outlet connect computer
USB connection common type interface also available
In addition providing additional storage capacity external drive also widely used create backup copy critical file computer internal hard drive
All hard drive fail point
Typically hard drive last many year may decide replace entire computer hard drive break get damaged
However imagine scenario new laptop save important file hard drive data file job assignment school family picture tax return everything
One day working laptop accident push desk floor
You hear strange noise try computer nothing happens
If serious hard drive failure may lost data
Data recovery may possible typically expensive need create backup copy important file regular basis
A one TB external hard drive USB connection cost around small price pay peace mind
The computer device store software installed computer well data file created used software
There two general type hard drive use one rotating disc rely magnetic storage moving mechanical part use flash memory like kind found USB flash drive
The important characteristic hard drive much data hard drive store referred

Modern computing arguably started British Mathematician proposed difference engine
This mechanical machine could calculate number given input
Unfortunately Babbage never got enough funding realise plan Victorian Computing Revolution however see completed modern version Science Museum London along half Babbage brain
Since Babbage several different design computer one going focus called Model Von Neumann machine
In machine Consider program stored DVD get machine run input data DVD memory using system bus
Once program loaded memory instruction sent CPU line line using system bus executed
Any thing printed shown screen sent Output box
We look detail component The processor Central Processor Unit CPU one complex part computer system
The processor executes program supervises operation rest system
Single chip processor otherwise known microprocessor
theorized number transistor could integrated onto chip would double every month modern processor contain billion transistor
Multicore microprocessor popular processor several core allowing multiple program thread run
data store directly addressed CPU Main memory used store program instruction data using System Bus communicate CPU
Main memory often created using Random Access Memory RAM Read Only Memory ROM
Modern computer gigabyte RAM meaning large program run multiple program run
The main memory larger number program run
Main memory consists data stored address general main memory address vice versa
In example perform following assembly code instruction This would return word Courgette If perform following assembly code instruction This would change value stored memory location Celery Beetroot Random Access Memory read written
Data cleared power Read Only Memory read data maintained power The two main type main memory ROM RAM
Whilst RAM might several gigabyte size ROM often kilobyte
As ROM read memory tends store core software instruction code needed load Operating System RAM known change bios
RAM much much larger store code run operating system program run computer
When load disc game console code wo anything loaded disc system RAM see loading screen
Give definition main memory Main memory data store directly addressed CPU What difference ROM RAM
ROM Read Only Memory RAM random access memory
This mean ROM written read
RAM read written
Name four component Von Neumann Architecture A Bus connection different device
This connection normally consist multiple wire along signal instruction data carried
In Von Neumann Architecture single bus manage connection three main component
The System Bus consists separate bus specific task need know
This three bus model expansion Von Neumann architecture showing greater detail
A bus carry address signal CPU Main Memory device
This might involve CPU requesting data Main Memory sending address data Main Memory Main Memory returning data along data bus
Let take look code This code asking load data memory address CPU address bus send address processor sends processor
To CPU would send along Address Bus value memory location would sent along Data Bus back CPU
The size Address Bus dictate much Main Memory system
For example Address Bus bit This would mean Main Memory could different addressable block A bus typically consisting wire used transport data instruction three component model
The larger Data Bus data transported one time
For example bit Data Bus maximum value could send along Bus would The larger Data Bus data send complex instruction use
A typically consisting wire used transport control signal three component model
The control bus used carry important information message say device finished job device plugged
A simple example would plug USB key moment screen pop asking want
The control bus also contains interrupt signal allow device printer keyboard disk etc
signal finished request
The CPU temporarily suspends current program service device resume previous program
The information serve well exam however way many modern processor work may break definition learnt Complete following table What largest number following width data bus carry one time width wire width wire width wire How many address following width address bus address width wire width wire width wire An address bus address maximum memory wire width
How many wire would need address maximum memory
byte memory But really good math answer
twice know half size
device used system get information internal connected CPU refer hand peripheral torso
We cover specific one need learn little later moment need know fundamental difference If look Von Neumann Architecture notice mention Keyboard display smart move want force every computer keyboard think game console keyboard VDU computer player screen
However computer architecture include specific controller An controller electronic circuit connects system bus device provides correct voltage current system bus device
Examples would include port complementary method performing CPU peripheral device computer
This allows device connected CPU without specialist hardware one
Think USB port computer connect Keyboards Mice Game pad Cameras Phones etc
connect using port
Main memory expensive often require storing data wo use constantly
Think computer game played couple month
The last thing want store code main memory taking precious expensive space
To get past issue use secondary storage
This normally inexpensive data storage sitting external CPU connected controller use need
Secondary Storage store data permanently without need electricity remain always Think USB key need plugged keep data
So taking game example load game main memory maybe DVD hard disk need
Examples secondary storage include Name input peripheral Name output peripheral Name two way connect peripheral CPU Name secondary storage device Name controller

A common scapegoat culprit error
But instructor mean say error
Are implying student made mistake
Are variation measurement really error
To able make sense situation student need firm understanding
They need know determine measurement uncertainty preserve measurement uncertainty calculation
Finally need able state result term uncertainty
Given trend towards teaching science inquiry student must able understand role measurement uncertainty use data draw conclusion science concept
Effective measurement technique includes key concept Distinguishing error uncertainty Recognizing measurement uncertainty Identifying type error source error error Estimating describing expressing uncertainty measurement calculation Using uncertainty describe result lab work Comparing measured value determine whether value within stated uncertainty
Some term module used different author different way
As result use term might conflict published us
The definition used module intended match usage document
For example term used mean Since exact true measured value quantity often determined error measurement rarely determined
Instead consistent NIST method quantify uncertainty measurement
used mean
This definition change usage commonly used term
For example term accuracy often used mean difference measured result actual true value
Since true value measurement usually known accuracy measurement usually known either
Because definition modified report lab result
For example student report result lab measurement calculate percent error result actual value
Instead determine whether accepted value fall within range uncertainty result

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
problem follows
I simulation neural network creates activity pattern learns try retrieve previously learned pattern one one
The performance retrieval result I interested
Simplified work I used fictive number make understandable My problem I change parameter say number pattern created first step number pattern I run whole thing create pattern learn retrieve time
Then I number pattern mean performance value plus corresponding standard deviation uncertainty mean
I know want single mean performance number pattern
That easy I calculate uncertainty overall performance value
Should I use gaussian error propagation uncertainty mean value I averaging
Or I use uncertainty newly calculated overall mean performance
So look like I calculate mean mean performance value corresponding number pattern basically I taking mean mean value
If could give hint best calculate overall uncertainty result I much appreciate
I googled lot also read information sheet error measurement sure best proceed
My current idea use gaussian error propagation I wo take uncertainty newly calculated mean value account
Thanks help

Related concept fundamental called unintelligible expression without straightforward description
It describes situation involving unknown
It applies prediction future event physical measurement already made unknown
Uncertainty arises environment well due
It arises number field including
Although term used various way among general public many specialist quantitative field defined uncertainty risk measurement Opinions carry type uncertainty
In economics distinguished risk uncertainty risk immeasurable impossible calculate referred Uncertainty must taken sense radically distinct familiar notion risk never properly separated
The essential fact mean case quantity susceptible measurement time something distinctly character crucial difference bearing phenomenon depending two really present operating
It appear measurable uncertainty proper shall use term far different unmeasurable one effect uncertainty
Other taxonomy uncertainty decision include broader sense uncertainty approached ethic perspective For example unknown whether rain tomorrow state uncertainty
If probability applied possible outcome using weather forecast even uncertainty quantified
Suppose quantified chance sunshine
If major costly outdoor event planned tomorrow risk since chance rain rain would undesirable
Furthermore business event would lost rain risk quantified chance losing
These situation made even realistic quantifying light rain heavy rain cost delay outright cancellation etc
Some may represent risk example expected opportunity loss EOL chance loss multiplied amount loss
That useful organizer event risk neutral people
Most would willing pay premium avoid loss
An insurance company example would compute EOL minimum insurance coverage add onto operating cost profit
Since many people willing buy insurance many reason clearly EOL alone perceived value avoiding risk
Quantitative us term uncertainty risk fairly consistent field
Some also create new term without substantially changing definition uncertainty risk
For example variation uncertainty sometimes used
But outside mathematical us term usage may vary widely
In uncertainty real matter perception threat etc

The statement ambiguous interpretation depends whether word meant
Ambiguity typically arises situation multiple analyst observer different interpretation statement
Uncertainty may consequence lack knowledge obtainable fact
That may uncertainty whether new rocket design work uncertainty removed analysis experimentation
At subatomic level uncertainty may fundamental unavoidable property universe
In put limit much observer ever know position velocity particle
This may ignorance potentially obtainable fact fact found
There controversy physic whether uncertainty irreducible property nature hidden variable would describe state particle even exactly Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows
The commonly used procedure calculating measurement uncertainty described Guide Expression Uncertainty Measurement GUM published
A derived work example NIST Technical Note Guidelines Evaluating Expressing Uncertainty NIST Measurement Results publication Quantifying Uncertainty Analytical Measurement
The uncertainty result measurement generally consists several component
The component regarded may grouped two category according method used estimate numerical value By propagating component function relating component measurement result combined measurement uncertainty given square root resulting variance
The simplest form repeated observation
In uncertainty measurement explicitly stated given range value likely enclose true value
This may denoted graph following notation In last notation parenthesis concise notation notation
For example applying meter scientific engineering application could written convention meaning accurate one tenth meter one hundredth
The precision symmetric around last digit
In case half tenth half tenth mean
Thus mean mean also written respectively
But accuracy within two tenth uncertainty one tenth explicit
The number parenthesis numeral left part number part notation uncertainty
They apply
For instance stand stand
This concise notation used example stating
The middle notation used error symmetrical value example
This occur using logarithmic scale example
Uncertainty measurement determined repeating measurement arrive estimate standard deviation value
Then single value uncertainty equal standard deviation
However value averaged mean measurement value much smaller uncertainty equal mean standard deviation divided square root number measurement
This procedure neglect however
When uncertainty represents standard error measurement time true value measured quantity fall within stated uncertainty range
For example likely atomic mass value given true value lie outside stated range
If width interval doubled probably true value lie outside doubled interval width tripled probably lie outside
These value follow property apply measurement process produce normally distributed error
In case quoted easily converted one two sigma three sigma
In context uncertainty depends measurement instrument
The lower accuracy precision instrument larger measurement uncertainty
Notice precision often determined standard deviation repeated measure given value namely using method described ass measurement uncertainty
However method correct instrument accurate
When inaccurate uncertainty larger standard deviation repeated measure appears evident uncertainty depend instrumental precision
Uncertainty science science general may interpreted differently public sphere scientific community
This due part diversity public audience tendency scientist misunderstand lay audience therefore communicate idea clearly effectively
One example explained
Also public realm often many scientific voice giving input single topic
For example depending issue reported public sphere discrepancy outcome multiple scientific study due methodological difference could interpreted public lack consensus situation consensus fact exist
This interpretation may even intentionally promoted scientific uncertainty may managed reach certain goal
For example global warming contrarian activist took advice frame issue scientific uncertainty precursor conflict frame used journalist reporting issue
Indeterminacy loosely said apply situation parameter system interaction fully known whereas ignorance refers situation known known
These unknown indeterminacy ignorance exist science often transformed uncertainty reported public order make issue manageable since scientific indeterminacy ignorance difficult concept scientist convey without losing credibility
Conversely uncertainty often interpreted public ignorance
The transformation indeterminacy ignorance uncertainty may related public misinterpretation uncertainty ignorance
Journalists may inflate uncertainty making science seem uncertain really downplay uncertainty making science seem certain really
One way journalist inflate uncertainty describing new research contradicts past research without providing context change
Journalists may give scientist minority view equal weight scientist majority view without adequately describing explaining state issue
In vein journalist may give amount attention importance scientist
Journalists may downplay uncertainty eliminating scientist carefully chosen tentative wording losing caveat information skewed presented certain conclusive really
Also story single source without context previous research mean subject hand presented definitive certain reality
There often product process approach aid downplaying uncertainty
Finally notably investigation science framed journalist triumphant quest uncertainty erroneously framed reducible resolvable
Some medium routine organizational factor affect overstatement uncertainty medium routine organizational factor help inflate certainty issue
Because general public United States generally trust scientist science story covered without cue special interest organization religious group environmental organization political faction etc
often covered business related sense frame social progress frame
The nature frame downplay eliminate uncertainty economic scientific promise focused early issue cycle happened coverage plant biotechnology nanotechnology United States matter question seems definitive certain
Sometimes stockholder owner advertising pressure medium organization promote business aspect scientific issue therefore uncertainty claim may compromise business interest downplayed eliminated

Relative uncertainty measure uncertainty measurement compared size measurement
It calculated relative uncertainty measured value If measurement taken respect standard known value relative uncertainty absolute error known value Relative uncertainty often represented using lowercase Greek letter delta δ
While absolute error carry unit measurement relative error unit else expressed percent
The importance relative uncertainty put error measurement perspective
For example error cm may relatively large measuring length hand small measuring size room
Three weight measured g g The The relative error g
A chemist measured time required chemical reaction find value hour
The first step find absolute uncertainty absolute uncertainty Δt hour hour The value many significant digit shortened rounded written multiplying value time

We know mean everyday speech
In way use word economics different two kind uncertainty economics differentiated
At press briefing Secretary Defense Donald Rumsfeld offered opinion much discussed
He distinguished two kind unknown unknown know know unknown know
Rumsfeld afterward mocked apparently eccentric observation fact distinction made intelligence circle many year
The difference known unknown unknown unknown also made economics respect uncertainty
As unknown turn one kind
University Chicago economist Frank Knight wrote difference one kind uncertainty another economics text One kind uncertainty wrote known parameter
If example put buy order particular stock current price X know stock fall far enough order execute
The outcome least everyday speech uncertain
You know however
This kind uncertainty limiting parameter
To use Rumsfeld remark know happen know one two thing order either expire execute
On September two hijacked airplane struck World Trade Center destroying building killing thousand
In aftermath stock United American Airlines plummeted value
Until morning one idea happen even possibility
The risk essentially unquantifiable event practical way stating parameter occurrence kind uncertainty also unquantifiable
This second kind uncertainty uncertainty without delimiting parameter come known Knightian uncertainty commonly distinguished economics quantifiable certainty Knight noted accurately termed risk
focused everyone attention uncertainty among thing
The general drift many respected book subject following disaster feeling certainty largely illusory think certain event wo happen date
This view however plausible rationale simply feeling
Perhaps influential book uncertainty Nassim Nicholas Taleb His thesis proposes many example innate largely unconscious human tendency draw limiting circle around given reality think whatever circle either think everything outside circle impossibility often think
Because Europe swan white one ever considered possibility black swan
Yet unusual Australia
The world Taleb writes filled black swan event many potentially catastrophic like
Because experienced may believe exist
In consequence Taleb argues prevented taking preventive measure avoid might occurred u considered possible considered
We back briefing room Rumsfeld facing two kind uncertainty kind uncertainty know uncertain kind black swan even know know

important consider uncertainty get rid
You reduce amount uncertainty certain measurement however requires resource care taking measurement human limited resource motivation
Eventually give trying make measurement accurate quote number measured uncertainty measured
Say I wanted measure length desk
three different measurement For first measurement I could take stick mark centimetre apart I could put next desk say desk centimetre second number sign
This would mean desk could anywhere centimetre
This measurement easy I put stick desk without making much effort align end desk likely okay
However I rely measurement I want fit desk centimetre gap wall I know desk bigger smaller gap
For second measurement take stick mark centimetre apart
With I measure desk centimetre wide
Doing better I still know desk fit gap
This measurement difficult take I take bit care aligning stick end desk
I also move stuff way
For third measurement I find stick mark centimetre apart
I take lot time trying align stick
I also borrow microscope I see well enough tell aligned stick end desk fiddly process
I finally manage take measurement centimetre
I finally know desk big gap
Scientists go similar process trying decide theory model fit reality
Say hypothesis predicted speed light someone measured
If uncertainty contradicts hypothesis however uncertainty support hypothesis uncertainty measurement completely meaningless

If instrument calibrated indication produce meaningful relation relevant standard
The defines parameter associated result measurement characterizes dispersion value could reasonably attributed measurand
The defines parameter characterizing dispersion quantity value attributed measurand based information used
For scalar measurands property interest quantified single real number suggests parameter may example standard deviation called specified multiple interval includes measurand stated coverage probability
The expression reserved measurement uncertainty expressed standard deviation
This suggestion follows position measurand probability distribution set possible value measurand used represent corresponding state knowledge circumstance standard deviation aforementioned attribute probability distribution represents scatter range possible value
This position expressed suggested measurement uncertainty reflects lack exact knowledge value measurand
The corresponding state knowledge best described mean probability distribution set possible value measurand
This probability distribution incorporates information available measurand indeed felicitous interpretation due Charles Ehrlich NIST fully characterizes degree belief varies set possible value
It distribution imparts meaning parameter chosen quantify measurement uncertainty
For example CODATA estimate value constant σ x W K corresponding standard measurement uncertainty u σ x W K
If probability distribution represents state knowledge constant Gaussian σ mean u σ standard deviation would suggest probability constant true value lie within u σ estimate
When measurand vector rather scalar quantity quantity even greater complexity example function transmittance spectrum optical filter parameter express measurement uncertainty suitable generalization analog standard deviation

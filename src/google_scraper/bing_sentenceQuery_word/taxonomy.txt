Q
What difference Taxonomy Ontology
A
Not much
The wisdom mass So err spectrum Lets see us term example So tag vocabulary arranged hierarchically taxonomy
But ontology
Well presumably since XBRL
effort make
And called Ontologies use OWL
The subject matter XBRL Ontologies expressing citation bibliographic reference RDF
Now OWL say The use little problematic seems one term ended meaning one discipline exactly opposite meant original discipline
In information science Ontology knowledge domain philosophy seems one step meta concerned category though Bill Clinton question mean probably exists kind existence talk
This confused lot year ago first I thought information guy really ignorant I found everyone used ontology loose way I decided I really ignorant conclusion term diverged opposite meaning ignorance expect one discipline terminology exactly another
What good pedantry
I see Ontology useful word bigger smarter abstract brother Taxonomy
But would nice term replace Ontology classical philosophical sense I get right IANAP meaning
Yes ontology larger variety relation type
Yes choose participate debate compare contrast computer science notion ontology notion owned philosophists
However contextually given put question membership computer science notion rule If still want diversity version OWL expects differing set property rule
Carl I came philosophy computer science found shift hard big deal
I use ontology time CS way
Indeed I tend toward restricted definition I happy leave conceptual stuff talking specific class logical theory
Indeed I tend distinguish taxonomy ontology base logical sophistication taxonomy subsumption derivable asserted path whereas ontology part taxonomic structure implicit
Even within CS get people moaning people corrupted grand old term Ontology YMMV

I developing web application user collection tag
I need create suggestion list user based similarity tag
For example user log system system get tag search tag DB user showing user similar tag
For instance following tag say match weight similar tag
But imagine situation
In situation system suggest vice versa
But know two user similarity field work work Web Technology Web Programming etc
So I need kind taxonomy computer science right probably I would need taxonomy field also like medicine physic mathematics etc
concept categorized I search similarity example say similarity belong one group category
I hope I described problem clearly something wrong explained would happy correction
Thanks I think actually taxonomy
With enough data able field infer relationship tag
See detail
If think tag clustering analysis based tag get far want look Flickr
Alternatively think taxonomy required consider using SKOS
If map tag SKOS perform kind analysis
Two source SKOS data may find particularly useful
If question using SKOS try
If term appear forum something like use construct cluster term
Generate using google set
It would harder get larger data set You need create relationship tag
I believe done automatically
You create database say
This way createsome kind
Tags sure multiple relationship

In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO
ontology considered upper ontology used linguistic tool learning domain ontology
The ontology example combination upper domain ontology
A survey ontology visualization technique presented Katifori et al
The established ontology visualization technique namely indented tree graph evaluated Fu et al
A visual language ontology represented specified
also called ontology building set task related development ontology particular domain
It subfield study ontology development process ontology life cycle method methodology building ontology tool language support
Ontology engineering aim make explicit knowledge contained software application organizational procedure particular domain
Ontology engineering offer direction overcoming semantic obstacle related definition business term software class
Known challenge ontology engineering include application designed assist creation manipulation
They often express ontology one many
Some provide export ontology language however
Among relevant criterion choosing ontology editor degree editor abstract actual used visual navigation possibility within
Next come facility support etc
Another important feature ability import export foreign language
Ontologies developed specific purpose application
Ontology learning automatic creation ontology including extracting domain term natural language text
As building ontology manually extremely time consuming great motivation automate process
Information extraction text mining explored automatically link ontology document example context BioCreative challenge
An used encode ontology
There number language ontology proprietary The coordinate attempt converge different ontology worldwide
The development ontology Web led emergence service providing list directory ontology search facility
Such directory called ontology library
The following library ontology
The following directory search engine
They include crawler searching Web ontology
In general ontology used beneficially several field

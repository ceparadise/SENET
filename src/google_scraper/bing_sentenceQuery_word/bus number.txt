In contraction Latin communication system transfer data component inside computer
This expression cover related hardware component wire optical fiber etc
software including communication protocol
Early computer bus parallel electrical wire multiple connection term used physical arrangement provides logical function parallel
Modern computer bus use connection wired either electrical parallel topology connected switched hub case
Computer system generally consist three main part CPU process data hold program data processed device communicate outside world
An early computer might contain CPU main memory reading writing data respectively
A modern system might memory display system interaction connection
In example computer bus one form another move data device
In traditional CPU main memory tend tightly coupled
A conventionally single chip number electrical connection pin used select main memory another set pin read write data stored location
In case CPU memory share signalling characteristic operate
The bus connecting CPU memory one defining characteristic system often referred simply
It possible allow peripheral communicate memory fashion attaching adaptor form directly system bus
This commonly accomplished sort standardized electrical connector several forming
However performance difference CPU peripheral varies widely solution generally needed ensure peripheral slow overall system performance
Many CPUs feature second set pin similar communicating memory able operate different speed using different protocol
Others use smart controller place data directly memory concept known
Most modern system combine solution appropriate
As number potential peripheral grew using expansion card every peripheral became increasingly untenable
This led introduction bus system designed specifically support multiple peripheral
Common example port modern computer allow number hard drive connected without need card
However system generally expensive implement device like mouse
This led parallel development number bus system solution common example standardized All example may referred although terminology universal
In modern system performance difference CPU main memory grown great increasing amount memory built directly CPU known
In system CPUs communicate using bus operate speed much greater memory communicate memory using protocol similar used solely peripheral past
These system bus also used communicate peripheral adaptor turn talk peripheral controller
Such system architecturally similar communicating bus rather network
In case expansion bus entirely separate longer share architecture host CPU may fact support many different CPUs case
What would formerly system bus often known
Given change classical term system expansion peripheral longer connotation
Other common categorization system based bus primary role connecting device internally externally PCI instance
However many common modern bus system used associated one example system would formerly described internal certain automotive application use primarily external fashion similar system bus
Other example like designed start used internally externally
The internal bus also known internal data bus memory bus system bus connects internal component computer CPU memory motherboard
Internal data bus also referred local bus intended connect local device
This bus typically rather quick independent rest computer operation
The external bus made electronic pathway connect different external device printer computer
Buses carry parallel multiple wire carry data form
The addition extra power control connection differential driver data connection direction usually mean serial bus conductor minimum one used
As data rate increase problem power consumption electromagnetic interference across parallel bus become difficult circumvent
One partial solution problem bus
Often serial bus operated higher overall data rate parallel bus despite fewer electrical connection serial bus inherently timing skew crosstalk
example
connection work well fast serial bus modern serial bus use hub design
connection generally regarded bus although difference largely conceptual rather practical
An attribute generally used characterize bus power provided bus connected hardware
This emphasizes origin bus architecture supplying switched distributed power
This excludes bus scheme serial parallel interface Ethernet since device also needed separate power supply
device may use bus supplied power often use separate power source
This distinction exemplified system connected connection associated modulated signalling scheme considered bus analogous connection
A phone line connection scheme considered bus respect signal us bus connection phone
However power provided case many data connection STANAG EFABus commonly referred data bus sometimes databuses
Such usually characterized several equipment connected common shared
They may ARINC
single source ARINC STANAG allow connected act different time transmitter receiver data
Over time several group people worked various computer bus standard including IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee BASC IEEE Superbus study group open microprocessor initiative OMI open microsystems initiative OMI Gang Nine developed etc
Early bus bundle wire attached peripheral
Anecdotally termed named electrical power bus
Almost always one bus memory one separate bus peripheral
These accessed separate instruction completely different timing protocol
One first complication use
Early computer program performed peripheral become ready
This waste time program task
Also program attempted perform task might take long program check resulting loss data
Engineers thus arranged peripheral interrupt CPU
The interrupt prioritized CPU execute code one peripheral time device others
system introduced idea essentially small computer dedicated handling input output given bus
introduced became common feature platform
Other vendor like implemented similar design
Generally channel controller would best run bus operation internally moving data CPU known busy elsewhere possible using interrupt necessary
This greatly reduced CPU load provided better overall system performance
To provide modularity memory bus combined unified
In case single mechanical electrical system used connect together many system component case
Later computer program began share memory common several CPUs
Access memory bus prioritized well
The simple way prioritize interrupt bus access
In case signal naturally flow bus physical logical order eliminating need complex scheduling
DEC reduced cost memory bus input output device appeared memory location
This implemented around
Early bus system essentially passive connected directly buffer amplifier pin
Memory device would added bus using address data pin CPU used connected parallel
Communication controlled CPU read wrote data device block memory using instruction timed central clock controlling speed CPU
Still device CPU signaling separate CPU pin
For instance controller would signal CPU new data ready read point CPU would move data reading memory location corresponded disk drive
Almost early microcomputer built fashion starting computer system
In instance notably although similar physical architecture employed instruction access peripheral memory others made uniform still generate distinct CPU signal could used implement separate bus
These simple bus system serious drawback used computer
All equipment bus talk speed shared single clock
Increasing speed CPU becomes harder speed device must increase well
When practical economical device fast CPU CPU must either enter work slower clock frequency temporarily talk device computer
While acceptable problem tolerated long computer
Such bus system also difficult configure constructed common equipment
Typically added requires many order set memory address address interrupt priority interrupt number
Second generation bus system like addressed problem
They typically separated computer two world CPU memory one side various device
A accepted data CPU side moved peripheral side thus shifting communication protocol burden CPU
This allowed CPU memory side evolve separately device bus bus
Devices bus could talk CPU intervention
This led much better real world performance also required card much complex
These bus also often addressed speed issue bigger term size data path moving first generation second well adding software setup standardised supplant replace jumper
However newer system shared one quality earlier cousin everyone bus talk speed
While CPU isolated could increase speed CPUs memory continued increase speed much faster bus talked
The result bus speed much slower modern system needed machine left starved data
A particularly common example problem quickly outran even newer bus system like computer began include drive video card
By AGP outgrown video card peripheral replaced new bus
An increasing number external device started employing bus system well
When disk drive first introduced would added machine card plugged bus computer many slot bus
But new system like introduced serve need leaving slot modern system empty
Today likely five different bus typical machine supporting various device
Third generation bus emerging market since including
They also tend flexible term physical connection allowing used internal bus well connecting different machine together
This lead complex problem trying service different request much work system concern software design opposed hardware
In general third generation bus tend look like original concept bus higher protocol overhead needed early system also allowing multiple device use bus
Buses developed movement attempt remove legal patent constraint computer design

bus incompatible design earlier IBM PCs
A computer bus set conductor enable information transmitted computer component printer modem monitor
Despite made fortune percent SATA common interface bus magnetic disk drive
A bus also known port either serial parallel depending whether data path carry one bit time serial many parallel
Serial connection use relatively wire often termed
This nomenclature derives presence many path electrical communication wire bundled joined together single device
Multiple peripheral attached single peripheral need homogeneous
An example small computer system select standard bus
The resulting standard bus open use became ubiquitous among early personal computer
Standardizing common bus helped expand market early peripheral manufacturer spurred development new device relieved computer manufacturer

A computing set physical connection cable printed circuit etc
shared multiple hardware component order communicate one another
The purpose bus reduce number pathway needed communication component carrying communication single data channel
This metaphor data highway sometimes used
If two hardware component communicate line called serial port
A bus characterised amount information transmitted
This amount expressed corresponds number physical line data sent simultaneously
A ribbon cable transmit bit parallel
The term used refer number bit bus transmit
Additionally bus speed also defined expressed Hertz number data packet sent received per second
Each time data sent received called
This way possible find maximum bus amount data transport per unit time multiplying width frequency
A bus width bit frequency MHz therefore transfer speed equal In reality bus generally constituted distinct physical line divided three subassemblies There generally two bus within computer A component route data computer bus component make computer communicate
The originally made large number electronic chip hence name
It generally two component It interesting note order communicate two bus must width
The explains RAM module sometimes installed pair example early Pentium chip whose processor bus required two memory module bit wide

A kind like train track connect CPU grand central station computer memory house addressable data neat device let u interact like mouse keyboard screen audio system
In early computer system data traveled across actual cable got pretty messy
Large bundle wire organized using bus bar term come
Nowadays wire typically trace tiny flat wire computer large flat surface electronic stuff get mounted
The critical connection computer system system bus

Another thing keep computer operation running smoothly quickly
A fast system bus needed slow computer operation
In order improve speed several alternative developed single system bus design shown earlier
Another big thing modern CPUs often memory right CPU chip called
This memory really fast access
When talk bus memory call internal bus distinguish main bus often called bus FSB
Technically speaking bus one part system bus term often used interchangeably
The speed bus important measure performance computer
A fast CPU lot main memory result fast computer unless bus also fast
So buying computer often see FSB speed reported part technical specification
This speed reported megahertz MHz
A CPU typically speed several hundred MHz plenty keep computer running smoothly
The connects CPU memory device
It carry data address control information
The speed system bus important part performance computer system like speed CPU size memory

analysis OOA process analyzing task also known develop conceptual model used complete task
A typical OOA model would describe computer software could used satisfy set requirement
During analysis phase programmer might consider written requirement statement formal vision document interview stakeholder interested party
The task addressed might divided several subtasks domain representing different business technological area interest
Each subtask would analyzed separately
Implementation constraint system built considered analysis phase rather addressed design OOD
The conceptual model result OOA typically consist set one number
It may also include kind
The input design provided output
Realize output artifact need completely developed serve input design analysis design may occur parallel practice result one activity feed short feedback cycle iterative process
Both analysis design performed incrementally artifact continuously grown instead completely developed one shot
Some typical common type design analysis input artifact The SDLC phase serve programmatic guide project activity provide flexible consistent way conduct project depth matching scope project
Each SDLC phase objective described section key deliverable description recommended task summary related control objective effective management

Baselines important part system development life cycle
These baseline established four five phase SDLC critical iterative nature model
Each baseline considered milestone SDLC
Complementary system development life cycle Few people modern computing world would use strict waterfall model SDLC many modern methodology superseded thinking
Some argue SDLC longer applies model like Agile computing still term widely use technology circle
The SDLC practice advantage traditional model system development lends structured environment
The disadvantage using SDLC methodology need iterative development
web development stakeholder need review regular basis software designed
Instead viewing SDLC strength weakness perspective far important take best practice SDLC model apply whatever may appropriate software designed
A comparison strength weakness SDLC An alternative SDLC rapid application development combine prototyping joint application development implementation CASE tool
The advantage RAD speed reduced development cost active user involvement development process

More To manage number system development life cycle SDLC model created waterfall fountain spiral build fix rapid prototyping incremental synchronize stabilize
The oldest best known waterfall sequence stage output stage becomes input next
These stage characterized divided different way including following The waterfall model well understood useful
In Information Center Quarterly article Larry Runge say SDLC work well automating activity clerk accountant
It work nearly well building system knowledge worker people help desk expert trying solve problem executive trying lead company Fortune
Another problem waterfall model assumes role user specifying requirement requirement specified advance
Unfortunately requirement grow change throughout process beyond calling considerable feedback iterative consultation
Thus many SDLC model developed
The fountain model recognizes although activity ca start others need design start coding considerable overlap activity throughout development cycle
The spiral model emphasizes need go back reiterate earlier stage number time project progress
It actually series short waterfall cycle producing early prototype representing part entire project
This approach help demonstrate proof concept early cycle accurately reflects disorderly even chaotic evolution technology
Build fix crudest method
Write code keep modifying customer happy
Without planning risky
In rapid prototyping sometimes called rapid application development model initial emphasis creating prototype look act like desired product order test usefulness
The prototype essential part requirement determination phase may created using tool different used final product
Once prototype approved discarded real software written
The incremental model divide product build section project created tested separately
This approach likely find error user requirement quickly since user feedback solicited stage code tested sooner written
The synchronize stabilize method combine advantage spiral model technology overseeing managing source code
This method allows many team work efficiently parallel
This approach defined David Yoffie Harvard University Michael Cusumano MIT
They studied Microsoft developed Internet Explorer Netscape Communications developed Communicator finding common thread way two company worked
For example company nightly compilation called build entire project bringing together current component
They established release date expended considerable effort stabilize code released
The company alpha release internal testing one beta release usually wider testing outside company finally release candidate leading gold master released manufacturing
At point release specification would frozen remaining time spent fixing bug
Both Microsoft Netscape managed million line code specification changed evolved time
Design review strategy session frequent everything documented
Both company built contingency time schedule release deadline got close chose scale back product feature rather let milestone date slip

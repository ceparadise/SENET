Technical debt concept programming reflects extra development work arises code easy implement short run used instead applying best overall solution
Technical debt commonly associated extreme programming especially context refactoring
That implies restructuring existing code refactoring required part development process
Under line thinking refactoring result poorly written code also done based evolving understanding problem best way solve problem
Technical debt may also known design debt
The term coined Ward Cunningham programmer also known developing first debt metaphor equates software development financial debt
Imagine project two potential option
One quick easy require modification future
The better design take time implement
In development releasing code quick easy approach like incurring debt come obligation interest technical debt come form extra work future
Taking time refactor equivalent paying principal
While take time short run also decrease future interest payment
Ward Cunningham describes concept follows The concept mean debt never incurred
Just leverage help company used correctly quick solution mean faster time market software development
In addition technical debt poor code
Bad code bad code technical debt result work good programmer unrealistic project constraint

The metaphor technical debt software development introduced two decade ago Ward Cunningham explain nontechnical product stakeholder need call refactoring
It refined expanded since notably Steve McConnell taxonomy Martin Fowler four quadrant Jim Highsmith colleague Cutter Consortium model impact technical debt total cost ownership
From original quite right code postpone making right people used metaphor technical debt describe many kind debt ill software development encompassing broadly anything stand way deploying selling evolving software system anything add friction software development endeavor suffer test debt people debt architectural debt requirement debt documentation debt amorphous software debt
Consequently concept technical debt software development become somewhat diluted lately
Is new requirement function feature yet implemented requirement debt
Do call postponing development new function planning debt
The metaphor losing strength
Furthermore identify tool static code analyzer assist u identifying technical debt danger equating whatever tool detect
This approach lead leaving aside large amount potential technical debt undetectable tool structural architectural debt technological gap
Gaps technology particular interest debt incurred result made wrong choice originally rather result context passing choice quite right retrospect
Technical debt case due external event technological obsolescence change environment rapid commercial success advent new better technology word invisible aspect natural software aging evolution
You could even argue gold plating architectural design making system flexible adaptable actually need form technical debt added flexibility hinders future development without actually exploited
To make progress need go beyond debt rhetorical concept
We need better definition constitutes technical debt perspective viewpoint let u reason across wide range technical debt
In short need theoretical foundation
Figure show possible organization technical debt rather software improvement given state
We distinguish visible element new functionality add defect fix invisible element rather visible software developer
We see left dealing primarily evolution challenge whereas right dealing quality issue internal external
We propose limit debt invisible element rectangular box including invisible aspect evolution quality
The technical debt landscape
On left evolution challenge right quality issue internal external
Most author agree major cause technical debt schedule pressure
However right side picture debt associated quality maintainability issue cause become probable carelessness lack education poor process nonsystematic verification quality basic incompetence
Because use iterative development process many agile team seem believe completely immune technical debt
Although iteration offer opportunity reimburse debt timely fashion opposite often occurs
Developing delivering rapidly time proper design reflect longer term lack rigor systematic testing including automated testing lead agile project massive amount debt rapidly
In fact debt mount much quickly project
But end matter choice time market essential debt might actually good investment imperative remain aware debt increased friction impose development team Cunningham suggested
So tackle technical debt least avoid accumulating much
The first step awareness identifying debt cause
The next step manage debt explicitly involves listing task common backlog release iteration planning along thing
Figure illustrates element might organized backlog
The element area color reconcile four type possible task attend future increase value adding new feature green investing architecture yellow reduce negative effect value defect red technical debt black
Four color backlog
The element area reconcile four type possible task attend future increase value adding new feature green investing architecture yellow reduce negative effect value defect red technical debt black
Project backlog often contain green element technical practitioner keep mind yellow element
The red element appear elsewhere perhaps defect database black element nowhere found increasingly cripple development reducing velocity
It important keep mind however technical debt code code quality
Code analysis tool identify small number black element
Therefore code analysis tool sufficient identifying technical debt often technical debt related code intrinsic quality structural architectural choice technological gap
No tool reveal two year ago team used tool internationalize localize code
Architecture play significant role development large system together development activity documentation testing often lacking
These activity add significantly debt thus part technical debt landscape Figure
Code analysis tackle right side box
Professionalism diligence dedication craftsmanship certainly help key determinant reducing technical debt
Kevin Sullivan suggested simple model tackling technical debt represents software development endeavor sequence change improvement
At given point time past set change defines current state software
Some past change event triggered current debt change way implemented quite right current perspective
The main issue facing software development organization decide future change What evolution software system undergo sequence
This evolution case constrained cost resource available apply making change likely driven value viewed external stakeholder
The process sequence change apply could main reconciling point across whole landscape shown Figure adding new feature adapting new technology fixing defect improving quality intrinsic extrinsic
Because decision process balancing cost value perhaps economic financial model could become unifying concept behind whole landscape
A already explored degree These four model discussed recent ICSE workshop technical debt one NPV offering promise better formalized opportunity cost simpler le proprietary TCO ROA seen probabilistic extension NPV
TCO present danger mentioned earlier diluting technical debt introducing element related software development deployment operation support
Technical debt treated isolation adding new functionality fixing defect even though included definition debt presented
The challenge expressing software development activity term sequence change associated cost value time
These change independent unfortunately
Their interdependency play big Mark Denne Jane shown particular visible feature depend le visible architectural aspect
In new perspective system technical debt given point time could defined deferred investment opportunity poorly managed risk
This installment give reader different illustration multifaceted concept technical debt
Erin Lim Nitin Taksante Carolyn Seaman went industry check software developer actually conceptualize perceive experience manage technical debt
They report result A Balancing Act What Software Practitioners Have Say Technical Debt
Their analysis describes large complex trade space stakeholder concern strategy keep balance
Raja Bavani complement view trench interview two agile expert Johanna Rothman Lisa Crispin Distributed Teams Agile Testing Technical Debt
He go offer taxonomy technical debt relates testing
Bill Curtis Jay Sappidi Alexandra Szynkarski explore viability estimation framework detecting technical debt using data
They use code analysis toolkit developed CAST Software identify technical debt large system based structural quality data literally put price Estimating Principal Application Technical Debt
As alternative Letouzey Michel Ilkiewicz describe Managing Technical Debt SQALE Method
The SQALE approach based analysis application source code using indicator quality attribute defined ISO system software quality standard testability maintainability portability narrow point focus
Have outgrown financial debt metaphor
Does still work
Do misuse
Israel Gat Christof Ebert disagree topic article
We hope keep debt metaphor useful confining really invisible result past decision software negatively affect extending concept anything cost
From practical perspective hope see tool method identify manage debt covering element landscape
From theoretical standpoint see model emerging likely rooted financial theory NPV better measurement reasoning form debt take place wider context software evolution software improvement

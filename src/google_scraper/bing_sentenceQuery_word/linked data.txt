In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

way data stored efficient search retrieval
Different data structure suited different problem
Some data structure useful simple general problem retrieving data stored specific identifier
For example online dictionary structured retrieve definition word
On hand specialized data structure devised solve complex specific search problem
The simplest data structure linear array stored element numbered consecutive content accessed number
Data item stored nonconsecutively memory may linked pointer memory address stored item indicate next item item structure located
Many developed sorting data efficiently apply structure residing main memory also structure information system
data structure may incorporate element simpler data structure
commonly use

A major area study computer science storage data efficient search retrieval
The main memory computer linear consisting sequence memory cell numbered Whereas control structure organize algorithm data structure organize information
In particular data structure specify type data thus operation performed eliminating need programmer keep track memory address

In consists set linked together organized
The link data also called
In linked data structure link usually treated special compared equality
Linked data structure thus contrasted data structure require performing arithmetic operation pointer
This distinction hold even node actually implemented element single array reference actually array long arithmetic done index data structure essentially linked one
Linking done two way using dynamic allocation using array index linking
Linked data structure include many widely used data structure
They also key building block many efficient algorithm
A linked list collection structure ordered physical placement memory logical link stored part data structure
It necessary stored adjacent memory location
Every data field address field
The Address field contains address
Linked list singly doubly multiply linked either linear circular
This example node class used store integer Java implementation linked list This example node structure used implementation linked list C This example using A structure like contains member point structure called structure
This example node class structure used implementation linked list A search tree tree data structure whose node data value stored traversal tree node visited ascending order stored value
Compared array linked data structure allow flexibility organizing data allocating space
In array size array must specified precisely beginning potential waste memory arbitrary limitation would later hinder functionality way
A linked data structure built dynamically never need bigger program requires
It also requires guessing creation time term much space must allocated
This feature key avoiding waste memory
In array array element connected sequential portion memory
But linked data structure reference node give user information needed find next one
The node linked data structure also moved individually different location within physical memory without affecting logical connection unlike array
With due care certain add delete node one part data structure even process thread working part
On hand access particular node linked data structure requires following chain reference stored node
If structure node node contains link node reached le log step slowing process accessing node sometimes represents considerable slowdown especially case structure containing large number node
For many structure node may require step
In contrast many array data structure allow access element constant number operation independent number entry
Broadly implementation linked data structure
It give u chance use particular space
Memory utilized efficiently using data structure
Memory allocated per need memory needed deallocation done
Linked data structure may also incur substantial overhead node allocated individually frustrate algorithm since generally poor
In case linked data structure may also use memory link field competing array structure
This linked data structure contiguous
Instances data found memory unlike array
In array nth element accessed immediately linked data structure follow multiple pointer element access time varies according structure element
In enforce constraint linked structure many problem require step unconstrained model

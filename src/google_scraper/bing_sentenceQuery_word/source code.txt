The source code program specially designed facilitate work computer specify action performed computer mostly writing source code
The source code often transformed understood computer
The machine code might stored later time
Alternatively source code may thus immediately executed
Most distributed form includes file
If source code included would useful programmer might wish study modify program
The Linux Information Project defines source code Source code also referred source code version software originally written typed computer human human readable alphanumeric character
The notion source code may also taken broadly include machine code notation graphical language neither textual nature
An example article presented annual IEEE conference Source Code Analysis Manipulation For purpose clarity source code taken mean fully executable description software system
It therefore construed include machine code high level language executable graphical representation system
Often several step original source code typed human executable program
While like argue intermediate file real source code count source code others find convenient refer intermediate file source code next step

The source code constitutes usually held one stored computer usually file carefully arranged known
Source code also stored database common elsewhere
The source code particular piece software may contained single file many file
Though practice uncommon program source code written different programming language
For example program written primarily might portion written optimization purpose
It also possible component piece software written compiled separately arbitrary programming language later integrated software using technique called
In language done class compiled separate file linked interpreter runtime
Yet another method make main program interpreter programming language either designed specifically application question write bulk actual user functionality form language approach taken example text editor
The project larger collection source code make project
It become common practice maintain code base
Moderately complex software customarily requires compilation assembly several sometimes dozen even hundred different source code file
In case instruction compilation included source code
These describe programming relationship among source code file contain information compiled
The system another tool frequently used developer source code maintenance
Source code primarily used input process produce executable program
It also used method communicating people book
often find helpful review existing source code learn programming technique
The sharing source code developer frequently cited contributing factor maturation programming skill
Some people consider source code expressive
software usually prohibitively difficult without source code
Without source code particular piece software portability generally computationally expensive
Possible porting option include emulation original platform
executable program used generate source code either
Programmers frequently adapt source code one piece software use project concept known
The situation varies worldwide United States software source code therefore always
In US Commission New Technological Uses Copyrighted Works CONTU decided computer program extent embody author original creation proper subject matter copyright
In United States court case ruled applied Copyright Act gave computer program copyright status literary work
In United States court case ruled source code could considered constitutionally protected form
Proponents free speech argued source code conveys information programmer written language used share humor artistic pursuit protected form communication

Source code list instruction programmer word processing developing program
The source code run turn machine code also called object code computer understand execute
Object code consists primarily
Source code object code state computer program compiled
Programming language compile code include C Delphi Swift Fortran Haskell Pascal many others
Here example C language source code You computer programmer tell code something printing Hello World
Of course source code much complex example
It unusual software program million line code
Windows operating system reported million line code
Source code either proprietary open
Many company closely guard source code
Users use compiled code see modify
Microsoft Office example proprietary source code
Other company post code internet free anyone download
Apache OpenOffice example open source software code
Some programming language JavaScript compiled machine code instead
In case distinction source code object code apply one code

Source code sometimes referred version computer program
For noncompiled program language term source code object code apply since one form code
Programmers use visual programming tool create source code
In large program development environment often management system help programmer separate keep track different state level source code file
Source code licensing agreement often reflect distinction
When user installs software suite like example source code proprietary Microsoft give customer access software compiled executables associated library file various executable file require call program function
By comparison user installs open source software code downloaded modified
Typically proprietary software vendor like Microsoft share source code customer two reason protect prevent customer making change source code way might break program make vulnerable attack
Proprietary software license often prohibit attempt discover modify source code
Open source software hand purposely designed idea source code made available many developer working enhance software presumably help make robust secure
Users freely take open source code public license
Beyond providing foundation software creation source code important purpose well
For example skilled user access source code easily customize software installation needed
Meanwhile developer use source code create similar program operating platform task would trickier without coding instruction
Access source code also allows programmer contribute community either sharing code learning purpose recycling portion application
Many different program exist create source code
Here example source code Hello World program C language Hello World program include main printf Hello World Even person background programming read C programming source code understand goal program print word Hello World
In order carry however source code must first translated understand job special interpreter program called compiler case C compiler
After programmer compile source code file contains resulting output referred object code
Object code consists mainly number one zero easily read understood human
Object code linked create run perform specific program function
Source code management system help programmer better collaborate source code development example preventing one coder inadvertently overwriting work another
Determining historical start source code subjective elusive exercise
The first software written code depending one viewpoint program may initial sample source code
One earliest example source code recognize today written Tom Kilburn early pioneer computer science
Kilburn created first successful digital program held electronically computer memory software solved mathematical equation
In source code often provided free software company created program
As growing computer company expanded software use source code became prolific sought
Computing magazine prior internet age would often print source code page reader needing retype code character character use
Later decreased price electronically sharing source code internet deleted obstacle

Whatever approach development may final program must satisfy fundamental property
The following property among important In computer programming refers ease human reader comprehend purpose operation source code
It affect aspect quality including portability usability importantly maintainability
Readability important programmer spend majority time reading trying understand modifying existing source code rather writing new source code
Unreadable code often lead bug inefficiency
A study found simple readability transformation made code shorter drastically reduced time understand
Following consistent often help readability
However readability programming style
Many factor little nothing ability computer efficiently compile execute code contribute readability
Some factor include The aspect indent line break color highlighting often handled content aspect reflect programmer talent skill
Various also developed intent resolve readability concern adopting approach code structure display
IDEs aim integrate help
Techniques like enhance readability
The academic field engineering practice computer programming largely concerned discovering implementing efficient algorithm given class problem
For purpose algorithm classified using express resource use execution time memory consumption term size input
Expert programmer familiar variety algorithm respective complexity use knowledge choose algorithm best suited circumstance
The first step formal software development process requirement analysis followed testing determine value modeling implementation failure elimination debugging
There exist lot differing approach task
One approach popular analysis
Many programmer use form various stage formal software development integrated together short cycle take week rather year
There many approach Software development process
Popular modeling technique include Analysis Design Architecture
The Unified Modeling Language notation used OOAD MDA
A similar technique used database design Modeling
Implementation technique include imperative language
It difficult determine popular modern programming language
Methods measuring programming language popularity include counting number job advertisement mention language number book sold course teaching language overestimate importance newer language estimate number existing line code written language underestimate number user business language COBOL
Some language popular particular kind application language regularly used write many different kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large engineering application development
Many application use mix several language construction use
New language generally designed around syntax prior language new functionality added example add C Java add memory management result loses efficiency ability manipulation
Debugging important task software development process since defect program significant consequence user
Some language prone kind fault specification require compiler perform much checking language
Use tool help detect possible problem
Normally first step debugging attempt reproduce problem
This task example parallel process unusual software bug
Also specific user environment usage history make difficult reproduce problem
After bug reproduced input program may need simplified make easier debug
For example bug compiler make crash parsing large source file
However simplification test case line original source file sufficient reproduce crash
Such simplification done manually using approach
The programmer try remove part original test case check problem still exists
When debugging problem GUI programmer try skip user interaction original problem description check remaining action sufficient bug appear
Debugging often done like

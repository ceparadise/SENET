TERM TERM

To elaborate let put couple small example unzipping list cool CSE project
Few month back friend quite interested organizing programming contest junior
Earlier computer Science Association used post question blog participant submit solution sending email
Those solution checked manually
We like idea manual checking
We put thinking cap developed online judge
College internet speed NIT W quite poor
It quite hard communicate college especially evening due heavy internet traffic therefore I came Mini Multicast Java LAN Chat Application
It quite fast used run direct Connection No proxy
alumnus used visit college official certificate transcript document
thought process become easy booking movie ticket
Alumni get required document without travelling mile
We wrote code came following project
Good Summer Projects The answer depends upon strong specialized field plus interest
Although I think would fair enough share idea project indulges part use creativity well judgment find project idea following suggested guideline may help
Most project developed Java contains API almost every task easy use platform independent easily develop GUI project
That best interesting java project
Almost everyone u played Mario counter Strike etc
How making game
Making Java game indeed easy Java default Graphics framework
DEMO Can easily implemented Java Java Sample Audio API
Again easy implement
A basic knowledge Concurrent Server
Easy implement
Thanks Java Sample API
Designing UI text editor Java Swing cake walk
Use advanced data structure like suffix tree Patrica etc searching
Any File Can unzipped command line providing password argument
So write simple brute force program generate permutation possible password send command line creating running shell script
Run receive success return call simple Zip Password Cracker Project ready
Again pretty easy
Run simple program remote computer
Intelligently create huge file SYS directory impact eat space victim computer
Any Clean software ignore file solution Victims reformat hard drive
A project record key stroke PC store intelligent way
Again easily done Microsoft visual SetWindowsHookEx API
The premiere challenge smart enough outplay detecting
Small game project easily done rendering computer graphic
C application par regular Expression
Editing document another machine via Web
The useful tool The cgi module along cgitb module debugging available
extension enables write arcade game Python
Develop web browser take input speech render output Speech
Lot frame work tool available
Good project PHP AJAX Expert
Similar Can easily done PHP server side scripting Language
Develop CMS similar Joomla Drupal etc
Students developed CMS named Pragyan
They use project maintaining college well Website
Develop something like uild application much interactivity repository useful reusable like
This project easily done
Develop application storing file image audio video etc
secure way
Use advance almost cipher AES etc
encrypt data text data caching password protected like Apart port blocked
Our College LAN allow port Port
Therefore develop tool bypass blocked port UDP TCP protocol
Identify design Network Protocol
TOR famous application used student tunneling website
Most college internet provider even blocked TOR
So build similar application tunneling defend network surveillance traffic analysis
Various project idea included idea page
More renowned organization participate program every year propose various open source project idea page
LINK
Even selected GSOC program long list idea write code send push request contribute open source community
Data Mining Projects always interesting
Pick paper read algorithm implement favorite programming language
When type first letter facebook search box ever noticed friend name search frequently interact mostly fb appears top suggestion box
That highly efficient algorithm implemented facebook
Develop similar tool add additional well custom feature
Most existing classifier quite accurate
Either read paper modify existing algorithm propose new algorithm classification
Develop classifier prove classifier efficient existing one
Create application like C JAVA compiler android mobile phone tracker etc
Still question
Ask

Within computer known called
create demo demonstrate ability
The key difference classical animation demo display demo computed making computing power consideration biggest challenge
Demos mostly composed mixed
The boot block demo demo created fit within small generally byte first block loaded typically created could boast accomplishment prior loading game
What began type electronic cracked software became unto
The produced inspired many technique used application today instance among others
frequently described demo digital emphasizing underground nature demoscene well way demo used proclaim authoring gang superiority
described demo digital referring creation aesthetically pleasing work overcoming strict technical restriction
There demo available great variety
Currently new demo program designed run operating system demo still actively made many machine including old new computer console mobile device
The main historical platform include demo competition platform still relatively common today demo party
There even demo running diverse platform
Unlike mainstream activity creating demo old computer commonly associated technical challenge nostalgic feeling
The accomplishment new groundbreaking thing major driving force demoscene limit various piece obsolete hardware still pushed forward several group
Even many democoders programming restricted platform order get touch way democoding longer available modern PCs
In still quite common different platform le separate demoscenes
When user different platform participated single event considered obvious split competition category supported platform
separate demo intro competition PC Amiga
Nowadays availability decent video capture brought different scene closer together
Alternative platform include interpreter applet even
Software platform restriction like however earned respect majority demosceners
In many released early equipment like including prevent unauthorised copy
Some cracker group started release game protection removed
Simple noninteractive demo also released book magazine often invitation expand listing game
Initially small demo shown actual game including music animation marquee greeting represent releasing group
The quality demo quickly considered figurehead group
Intros increased quality often touching limit computer ability
The cracker group started severe competition first releasing cracked copy game
At moment levering copy protection decreased importance artist inside scene
They felt programming ambitious Intros challenging
While publisher improved copy protection quality Intros increased well
Often fame group based spectacular Intros
The introduction computer system like resulted new distribution work inside group since hardware allowed new possibility
The creation Intros divided programming music graphic
Intros often spread
At end unlicensed copy increasingly became issue software industry
The development game certain platform stopped entirely due insufficient profit claimed cracker scene responsible doom Amiga platform
Some Amiga game released cracker released commercially
Eventually around year people concentrated making pure demo without sort game context led release demo computer art without illegal distribution computer game
Some group remained engaged pirate game demo whereas many group concentrated making demo
Towards end commercial lifetime Amiga ST computer separation cracking demo group yet widened
Small file size integral feature certain type demo beginning needed squeeze crack intro small leftover area
It also important advertisement intro relatively small since typically included every file downloaded BBS
Sometimes even platform dictated size restriction size generally byte also maximum size boot block demo
The common size limit intro hand segment size also maximum size
In later time practical need small demo diminished willingness compete squeezing much little space disappeared
It therefore necessary introduce artificial size restriction order challenge author
In modern demoscene event relatively loose size restriction quite strict limit kilobyte le
Because strict size limit intro show programmer ability squeeze much little space often generating graphic sound data rather reading datafile
Because extremely low size limit intro used lack sound extremely low quality music
As technology progress however sound synthesis become new frontier demoscene
still lowest border demosceners demoparties organize byte byte even byte intro competition
While creating might require programming knowledge anymore competition require demo coder skilled assembly programming algorithmic optimization
For comparison The size section article kilobyte
technique developed small intro worked way mainstream gaming game
There several category demo informally classified
The common way classify demo platform size class purpose content style demo also matter
An originally referred endless demo action happened single graphical screen often promote BBS game crack
Nowadays refer demo written within strict size limit kB kB
Also demo written announcement purpose demo party invitation typically called intro regardless actual size
Many demosceners reserve term demo exclusively demo compete demo competition rather intro competition
However current trend squeezing whole demo within strict size limit decreased kind division
Most demo party least one intro competition rule nearly main demo competition exception size limit executable file
The common intro type size executable file limited byte respectively
Some intro type defined content rather size may also name
Crack intro attached cracked game perhaps oldest category intro
demo intro serve invitation demo party
A announce new demo group announce new group member recruit others
For real life event announce wedding even also called announce birth child demo scener
The term much le common either mean demo intro demo size short preview upcoming demo
A megademo demo consists data
An Amiga standard disk plus packing advantage size qualifies megademo
The first trackloaded demo short Trackmos megademos released Amiga
Megademos quite uncommon today demoscene
The term often used computer data would unusual impossible describe demo several part larger typical demo
For example Shock Megademo closer kilobyte size
Or classic space
As demoscene grew demogroups became competitive term could accomplish megademos developed became elaborate
Megademos soon became collection demoscreens brought together one compilation usually written demogroup often featuring one guest demo member member demo group
These demo accessible menu style varied user selecting demo simple list name interactive method choosing demo using keyboard mouse navigate avatar stick man race car spaceship around display demoscreen found activated
These megademos usually followed format whereby one two intro first displayed main menu presented user could select demo wished view
There often one demoscreens available megademos access point hidden certain key combination entered user reveal hidden demo
Hints existence method access hidden demo could usually found reading scrolling text one demo within megademo
As megademos became popular number demoscreens available would increase size often span two disk requiring user swap disk main menu whichever demo resided second disk
Since early predominant demo format visual effect follow set timeline synchronized continuous soundtrack much like music video
The word track also refers data track floppy disk therefore called trackmo original sense demo run diskette use trackloader read data
The first trackmos included Enigma Phenomena Mental Hangover Amiga
Demos consist program traditionally considered three main element demo associated respectively
The overall design also considered important although group lack specialized designer
Demos executable program program code created coder still considered important element demo
Although program known allow creation technically decent demo without coder involvement demo group using code still widely frowned upon
It customary release demo various reason although handful notable demo source code released
Earliest demo typically made program used cracker crack copy protection
The next step transition monitor
programming language C started gradually take assembly programming demo timing longer considered important compiler beginning able produce code comparable assembly
The transition language originated PC scene
Nowadays demo programmed pure assembly rare PC except extreme category assembly still widely considered relevant choice democoding platform Commodore
Snippets program code performing visual trick collectively called always integral part demo
Effects often used show programmer skill although seldom used content element
See
used demo since beginning copied software needed packed compact easily spreadable format often required kind compression software attached intro
Early demo often multiple part separately decompressed memory short pause part
The demo intro modern platform compressed either executable compressor program specifically designed compression small intro
The decompressor stub integrated intro often well byte size
Some intro may even wrap inside order eliminate byte
Decompression facility provided operating system may also used
Many intro use procedural technique texture object music
Some idea pioneered The Black Lotus PC intro
Nowadays achievement group
Procedural generation often disguised compression order increase amusement value
See example end scrollers
Recently competition held procedural rendered graphic fit executable file kilobyte
These picture often consist landscape size executable file challenge
Demos written older platform often use video mode rather standard one
Some example Drawing art newly invented graphic mode often require sceners first write graphic editor
Recently become le difficult crossplatform tool like Graph Font Atari computer Grafx Amstrad CPC
Music generally integral part demo lack soundtrack tolerated intro category
Before advent music editing software music earliest cracktros demo often game
However developed group began creating music specifically demo
Certain early group even specialized music
Early soundtrack typically synthetic style originated
The Oldskool chiptune style continued later Amiga Atari PC intro due efficient use memory even though system often allowed playback full digital sound sample
The development greatly affected style demo music making possible program many genre music although variant widespread
Today demo music remains electronic even though streaming format allow use type soundtrack
With le limitation sound playback demo musician may use professional audio tool create complex soundtrack possible earlier tracker software
Many demo group created music editor released music editor right
example include classical PC tracker respectively modular synthesizer
On Amiga platform format almost universally used allowed playback little CPU overhead
In demo music played back stock player routine player routine specific music editor
Specialized player also common particularly intro
Modern intro often contain may even written specific song mind
In demoscene parlance typically includes work still image texture charsets short character set monospaced font scene object color scheme
Effects visualization usually regarded graphic
The traditional form graphic art demo made dedicated editor commercial graphic software
The still image modern PC demo usually made software
The technical skill artist often stressed far originality imagination gave birth many clichés demoscene art
fantasy theme dragon sword spaceship common image woman clothed naked
The earliest object scene demo often simplistic constructed coder often without software whatsoever
Nowadays many demo several complex scene lack still art entirely
In many group advanced routine capable dealing complex object lacked member skilled interested modeling
This lead many demo simple procedural object example file object duck
The use stock object origin lot insider humor within demoscene
broadest sense refers everything combine separate element demo consistent whole synchronization soundtrack visuals overall choice concept structure narrative
active Amiga early known one first group paid considerable attention design aspect
While demoscene already phenomenon day lot demo common element reiterated modern demo well
It traditionally standard demo creator send demoscene group typically platform
While often used early day current graphically complex demo greets usually presented demo effect mapping group name onto object using particle system fill letter groupname
Being greeted demo usually considered honor especially demo
While rule one greet tradition dictate group send greeting group consider friend
Other group usually newcomer demo scene sufficient contact prefer greet group whose work consider influential
Some group occasionally send greeting individual people
Greetings sometimes include fucking creator explain dismay another group production behavior
Fuckings common early day demoscene quite rare nowadays mostly used comedic effect
One fucking demo appeared Nexus scroller said It important demo display list name people made demo
These also usually presented graphical effect group prefer cinematic approach present credit opening scene overlay end
Credits demo however rarely feature creator real name opting use instead
There recurring element demo sometimes due technicality demomaking sometimes certain trend scene tend reappear year
Historically popular theme computer since bouncing ball demo released computer
It later became primary theme early Atari game
released bouncing ball demo illustrate capability VIC chip
A similar theme used Amiga Corporation demonstrate capability Amiga computer Winter Consumer Electronics Show January
It showing spinning ball bouncing casting shadow bouncing ball became official logo company
Within context tradition bouncing ball demo Consumer Electronics Show CBS Electronics also showed Bouncing Ball demo spinning bouncing ball event
Following demonstration bouncing ball theme reappeared various demoscene production

In act running set program operation order ass relative object normally running number standard test trial
The term also mostly utilized purpose elaborately designed benchmarking program
Benchmarking usually associated assessing performance characteristic computer hardware example floating point operation performance circumstance technique also applicable software
Software benchmark example run
Benchmarks provide method comparing performance various subsystem across different architecture
type system intended ass software
As advanced became difficult compare performance various computer system simply looking specification
Therefore test developed allowed comparison different architecture
For example processor generally operate higher clock frequency processor necessarily translate computational power
A slower processor regard clock frequency may perform well processor operating higher frequency
See
Benchmarks designed mimic particular type workload component system
Synthetic benchmark specially created program impose workload component
Application benchmark run program system
While application benchmark usually give much better measure performance given system synthetic benchmark useful testing individual component like networking device
Benchmarks particularly important giving processor architect ability measure make tradeoff decision
For example benchmark extract key application contain aspect application
Running much smaller snippet simulator give clue improve performance
Prior computer microprocessor architect used although SPEC benchmark quite lengthy thus unwieldy use intact
Computer manufacturer known configure system give unrealistically high performance benchmark test replicated real usage
For instance compiler could detect specific mathematical operation used benchmark replace operation faster mathematically equivalent operation
However transformation rarely useful outside benchmark architecture emphasized importance technology related performance
Benchmarks regularly used company improve benchmark score real application performance
CPUs many execution unit CPU CPU CPU typically slower clock rate sequential CPU one two execution unit built transistor fast
Nevertheless CPUs many execution unit often complete benchmark task le time supposedly faster CPU
Given large number benchmark available manufacturer usually find least one benchmark show system outperform another system system shown excel different benchmark
Manufacturers commonly report benchmark aspect benchmark show product best light
They also known significance benchmark show product best possible light
Taken together practice called Ideally benchmark substitute real application application unavailable difficult costly port specific processor computer system
If performance critical benchmark matter target environment application suite
Benchmarking easy often involves several iterative round order arrive predictable useful conclusion
Interpretation benchmarking data also extraordinarily difficult
Here partial list common challenge

How know student learning right thing right time
Is even thing
Should high achiever set standard education
These main question surrounding practice benchmarking education
education occurs measurable standard set learning
For example benchmark might set concept must mastered grade
They might also used see particular student class even school rank comparison others
Now understand benchmarking let look reason using
Jordan third grade student
His family moving Florida Ohio transferring new school
Since state vary greatly term education new school know Jordan term academic aptitude
Benchmarking may provide answer
For example Jordan Florida school able share academic benchmark Jordan achieved thus far third grade might help new school place correct class program
Therefore one reason use benchmarking
This assessment limited assisting placement
For example educator use benchmarking improve performance among specific student even among student large school district
Let say school certain district Illinois
Benchmarking may help school district understand replicate practice used Illinois district
In word school use benchmarking set standard best practice learning achievement
Stated simply benchmarking raise standard education creating model excellence achievement
This model duplicated others
You may thinking benchmarking education sound good true
Let take look limitation benchmarking
Imagine two elementary school school A school B
School A school based measure achievement
School B deemed failing school
How would feel child student school B
You might worry quality education child receiving may even begin look option
How would student teacher staff school B feel
Revealing inequity one unintended drawback benchmarking
It may even lead disparity education situation student school decreased opportunity compared others
Assume teacher school A
How much pressure think would feel keep school highly ranked
How would handle student measure
Would worry job security face low performance

Intense pressure perform emerge practice benchmarking education
school feel pressure maintain level excellence school feel need bar
Needless say constant need measure make thing tough student teacher staff
If education student highly focused meeting benchmark individual need student may fall wayside
This especially problematic student may get extra attention classroom need
This set failure going forward educational journey
Therefore care must taken using benchmarking education
The need student teacher staff must take precedence pressure achieve
A balance must found setting reaching educational benchmark meeting need student
education set standard learning achievement
It help assessment placement performance
Furthermore benchmarking used raise standard education establishing best practice
However benchmarking without limitation
If used carefully benchmarking lead inequity education excessive pressure perform loss individual attention classroom

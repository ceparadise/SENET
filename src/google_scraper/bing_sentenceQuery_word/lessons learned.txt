The effort made many others student learn computer science seem working There doubt need people computer science education demand software engineer continues vastly outpace supply
But read based personal experience computer science hard attrition rate often high
There computer science class I took Rice University took time effort grit class I taking time combined
Due early interest computer I declared CS major day college never looked back
While I came strong interest minor programming
knowing basic data structure function loop I quickly learned computer science programming I would fair share struggle I went challenging discipline
Over next year I absorbed lot knowledge wisdom professor mentor
I took lot computer science class TA ed
I productive fun summer I first summer interned following summer
During senior year I became President visibility I got mentor lot peer Rice
I also got deep conversation hundred student Rice university career aspiration
As I leave view undergraduate CS education top university I feel obligated pas advice form writing navigate succeed obtaining CS education
During first semester Rice significant overhaul computer science curriculum announced
During info session led chair undergraduate program I remember raising hand asking What programming language taught new curriculum prepare student industry I saw look annoyance Rixner face answered question later I realized I paying attention wrong stuff
Time emphasized good education computer science teach think learn
At first I disinclined believe impatience I heard many talk alumnus working industry technical interview I realized best company care programming language knew best engineer label Java Expert Ruby How model information around represent data computationally processed
How approach problem use algorithm solve
These question computer science answer teach think computationally
Computer science department across world vary much focus theoretical practical aspect computing
The reusable concept abstract thinking help much career long term compared learning programming language framework
Therefore stay curious focus fundamental
Programming major part computer science practice
It involves writing instruction computer perform basis data structure logic algorithm system design
While fundamental come first programming also important especially want become software engineer CS degree
In book Malcolm Gladwell enumerates many example well known extremely successful people spent roughly ten thousand hour achieve mastery domain
The example caught interest highlight mastery luck
At time programming done tediously punching card submitting run mainframe computer appointment find error start getting lot programming practice extremely difficult
Bill Gates lucky access computer terminal got programming computer terminal new rare
Once Gates began programming addicted would sneak parent home AM AM program computer happened free time University Washington
By time Bill Gates Paul Allen dropped college form Microsoft easily acquired hour practice programming
hour work seem really daunting first
But consider basketball player spends endless hour playing court teammate
Or software developer writes code day long job go home write even code project
Eventually people fall love especially work sufficiently varied challenging able make progress feel like work anymore
In month I I start work I spending one month programming project I meaning complete one month traveling friend Europe
I find equally exciting
There substitute shortcut gaining mastery programming
For elaboration read Through grading assignment speaking student I seen really high quality work submitted hour effort lower quality work done hour
The frustrating aspect programming debugging problem seem find cause
Last year I TA one friend came hour struggling trying get loading indicator show one iOS apps
We went possible problem mistake verified case
Then occurred check color
Turns indicator along white white background
Can imagine look friend face
Are friend student took hour hour assignment inherently incompetent
No
These kind situation happened everyone ask people share favorite story
The point pay attention quality time spent towards effort avoid repeating mistake
Repeating mistake easy come varying form
The trick find underlying cause pay attention process lead mistake frustration treat symptom
At time problem stem lack clear understanding assignment task hand
It tempting jump coding disastrous really know
For first operating system assignment I remember reading time writing note finally clear idea I supposed
I remember meeting manager last summer half hour could clarify I supposed I fully understand
Also never spend much time stuck problem
Getting help give fresh pair eye look problem let see instructor TA friend manager approach problem debugging
Whether theoretical problem set programming assignment task internship notice Goldilocks zone asking help time independently completing task
Experience active strive improvement help find zone varies situation situation
If want turn hour hour work go hang friend Friday night start building strategy getting stuff done efficiently
Most proudest work come academic internship requirement
Knowing expectation give confidence freedom whatever like side
This kind work really get creative juice flowing something deeply fulfilling building stuff
My greatest accomplishment web app secure online election
Today used organization within Rice including residential college
We ran election Rice ballot cast
Working project taught create piece software work database design scalable architecture gain UX design experience market product consider business viability
If underclassman considering CS side project like one I mentioned sound really intimating
But small step get skill confidence experience work impressive stuff
For example first side project I worked first hackathon I attended called simple poem writing app find rhyme based last line wrote
This took partner Dennis I hour create lot Googling around learning Javascript
Today I confident u could write hour alone
On note hackathons I highly encourage attending really fun productive
If hackathons university
Experiences working side project give great conversation make interview excitement shine
Furthermore project grow opportunity
Mark Zuckerburg probably thinking creating dollar company initially writing Facebook college
Apply early apply often anything everything interest
Was assignment class found really interesting
Talk professor research opportunity relevant
Use summer internship apply learn school
For underclassman Google specifically internship program specifically freshman
The one thing I like stress apply many place possible even one think land wildest dream increase odds finding good opportunity
Desperate get industry internship I applied company sophomore year land offer
One Google whose technical interview technical interview ever
I spent week preparing simulating mock interview pretending talk phone using
For technical interview advice read friend series
You also find information application process internship experience specific company Quora
If internship go well likely get return internship offer depending graduation date
Regarding return internship offer I strongly recommend taking finding better different opportunity instead scared get offer later otherwise
If got offer get another future
An internship month long expectation full time job much longer
So internship great way dabble around explore option
You know missing try
I return offer Google first internship tempting take
I wanted offer work I feared I return internship I get offer later
I end returning another internship got offer anyway
I really glad I tried different company instead gave whole new perspective much compare I decided work
This apply computer science
It easy fall emotional pitfall comparing others
The people started programming age hackathons even came college might find easy look upon others
While someone struggling understand concept class might look person eagerly answer question think How I ever going good These kind comparison cause envy contempt either damage one make one err side arrogance
Instead focusing others focus make unique
Start making goal important find way achieve
For example compare person year ago look way improved progressed ask want year today
go long way towards improving quality
If interested lot thing careful overcommit
After successful freshman year ambitious I felt invincible starting tacking every opportunity I came across
During sophomore fall semester I enrolled normal insanely class one COMP Mobile Device Applications whose prerequisite I satisfy I Programming experience
I part time student job I became TA freshman CS intro class
Additionally I involved student club permanent improvement committee head residential college redesigning website
My entire day would gone attending class meeting
I would start work around PM get tired continue around AM
Later I developed insomnia able sleep till
Only wake AM get ready morning class repeat process
Midway semester thing got tougher I nearly broke
I attended session hosted Rice Wellness Center spoke one professor one RAs friend
I found way reduce stress commitment pas failing one class I taking bare minimum work
That semester one worst time life I really learned prioritize say
My friend Veronica wrote phenomenon I wish I read back
When graduate college look back year later going remember care exam ace
What remember cherish friendship made college time spent together
Step comfort zone make many friend possible within outside major
Working together impossibly hard problem set friend make realize alone struggle
Your friend outside major open diverse set interest activity make individual
Yeah I know sound really cliche
But know people treat according way carry go far allows
So build
Notice strength make unique
When make achievement bask glory
Learn handle rejection
Receive compliment well think positively
Thanks reading post
I like share book I read college helped lot If feedback would like talk feel free reach
By clapping le signal u story really stand
Techie Traveller Learner

Learning computer science one enjoyable experience human life also one frustrating
You came across page either want learn computer science want learn computer science want computer science job
Whatever motivation computer science may seem like witchery
Geeks use overly complicated jargon explain concept
A friend mine Michelle Bu novice programmer way noted programmer perpetual competition see claim thing You want join club know get
Joining world like trying take castle butter knife
I remember first lesson computer science
I tried learn program googling How In hindsight futile search result either encompassing vague technical detailed
I went ask computer science friend
It went something like Me I want learn program
Can teach program Friend Sure
Let start variable
A variable store value
There different type variable
A int variable store integer long variable store larger integer Me Hold
What
Back
What difference int long Friend One store integer one store bit Me What store mean Friend It put value memory Me What memory location Friend The memory location information Me That help memory location
And decide store Friend Well compiler program run creates memory address memory
When variable name reference value
The compiler look memory Me Huh
What compiler Friend Don worry
Just remember int store bit integer long store bit That unhelpful
Asking simple question like What difference ints longs unravels others question computer science
It like trying behead hydra
Chop one head come back head
Before know instructor trying stitch head back would shut
I want anyone scared experience like
Some fortunate support I I learning computer science long shied away
Computer science fun
In opinion one truest expression self
It best ability innovate create
It like playing God
Sure mess bunch time part excitement whatever create
This guide lengthy really break several manageable part read come back often feel lost get stuck
It meant comprehensible intention bestow much knowledge I
To learn computer science must break process learning three hierarchical form learning abstraction fine tuning
Many guide focus one aspect without giving overarching understanding fine tune implementation
Your learning learning objective broken general strategy helpful tactic tool acquisition
Strategies overarching principle studying computer science
In section I covering necessary infrastructure learning
These concept cover topic like seek help ask question set environment learning debug
Tactics strategy tackling computer science problem
Problems different exercise sense know go solving problem
An exercise would something like power
Even though difficult exercise would know exactly solve
A problem hand ambiguous presentation
You may see problem know solve
It creates mystery sense helplessness many also creates wonder excitement like challenge
Of course everyone different boundary define problem exercise
Some may consider question problem whereas others would consider exercise
Learning tactic building arsenal tool tackling new problem
Computer science filled fun challenging problem take
In section I teach favorite method tackle new challenge
Tools kind thing people think think computer science
Knowing Ruby understanding How design greedy algorithm thing consider tool
Tools help thing computer science
You learn tool journey computer science
Learning tool tackling problem use slightly different approach come learning share lot common term learning
Tools entail syntax language data structure anything concrete understanding something
Often solved problem acquired tool solve similar problem
Maybe hash table recursion worry understand term right learned study
Tools least important concept three matter many tool acquire know strategy tactic know improvise forever stay novice
As may see strategy important topic learning computer science followed tactic followed tool
In fact I put little emphasis tool
I point tool acquire acquire I go much material
Everyone moment self doubt journey towards learning computer science
It okay
It completely natural feel way time
To help counter journey must understand journey u
Here map There three stage understanding used model learning path
At beginning everyone call apprentice
The main role apprentice mimic
They copy master master sometimes without much questioning
During stage learning beginner learn following exercise teacher tell teacher flexible entity could book tutorial actual teacher
If teacher throw material said learn flounder sink like rock
You overwhelmed material discouraged monumental challenge
So instead learn structure
However bit time feel comfortable material well sort
You feel comfortable tiny realm mimicry
Apprentices learn fairly quick rate hit first peak
Afterwards graduate artisan
Instead following best practice artisan learn improvise
All sudden template copy anymore
Sometimes even correct solution
The training wheel safety net gone creates sense frustration loss
Good programmer get trench
They struggle tremendously late night obsession lack sleep minor depression rigor
The push past ceiling trench
Then plateau
They either become comfortable continue hone skill sometimes believe getting anywhere
In considerable time become master
Like learning path guide broken three stage
Tools main approach used apprentice phase tactic take dominant role learning artisan phase
Strategies although guarantee mastery essential part helping reach
This path fractal nature well describes general learning path also learning path learning new
concept well
Understand journey ease anxiety nervousness initial failure
If ever feel journey
Don give remember frustration currency progress dedication price pay successful student
Let talk strategy
Many people afraid learning program know go learning computer science strategically
They know start go language pick know knowing know
Knowing tackle new learning endeavor strategically mean directed effort towards learning goal
I think could take away one lesson guide learning would get started early possible
It matter learn le inefficient manner know going
As long know whatever heading right direction best option go
If still lot unanswered question computer science like programming language I start learning What tutorial best learning X push aside question get started
Many answer find along way
People tend fall analysis paralysis
They read computer science purchase programming book read guide like one formulate lifelong plan study computer science never write single line code
If ever find state find actionable step take direction goal take
I even make decision follow The Roadmap bottom
It best get destination
Your first priority like every beginner first priority take first step
So jump
Come join world computer science fun lost
Author Tim Cahill book Jaguars Ripped My Flesh quoted The explorer person I big fan online learning
I take online course Coursera Udacity Edx time
As much I would love urge everyone sign class away people part community important grasping understanding computer science
Not collaboration important learning computer science crucial work industry everyone computer science industry collaborates one another
I think important figure following role complete satisfying learning journey
Forming community beyond encounter
It regularly seeing meeting interacting people
Having strong community necessarily large make learning journey much easier directed frankly fun
Have mentor
You want someone better computer science explain answer question may
Having person call extremely important time trying find answer online book fruitful
You frustrated angry feel helpless
You need someone help
You need someone listen problem answer question someone shoe understands hardship
Not answer technical question also answer broader question like I want build robot drive I study I quite sure I learn Their experience provide curriculum rather provide direction insight
Really try find patient understanding teacher
It better find someone poorer mastery subject explain understanding clearly find someone computer genius would scoff dumb question
This crucial
I seen many ambitious computer science beginner give pursuit computer science met someone answer question demean mentees asking dumb question extinguish flame curiosity
Find someone brings best really trust wisdom
Also preferably find someone know person meet person
Best case scenario mentor already friend
Worst case lack friend know computer science
If know acquaintance even stranger ask help flattered
If school look teacher assistant class
If still fruitless check see local programming group local university
If hopeless check forum learning computer science
Often find wide supporting community although never paramount meeting
If UC Berkeley student mentor message
Another important person learning community finding someone around level expertise
I find process discussing computer science concept another human extremely rewarding term building meaningful relationship learning computer science
Your peer teach encourage help effectively
I know many traveler give learning become uncomfortable lost world computer science
Having fellow nomad make journey speedier pleasant
A peer help tackle problem
Although may seem like slacking divvy work learning interaction increase exponentially
Interacting peer help discus different perspective problem solving tactic particular problem
In many academic subject especially computer science different approach tackling problem
By exposing different approach method understanding concept solving exercise understand material hand thoroughly
Vocalization thought also help solve problem even lost
In computer science often called The Rubber Ducky Debugging Tool debugging methodology explain bug problem rubber duck thereby understanding problem bit better
Why use rubber duck human understanding responsive human much better
Beyond realm problem set peer also bring culture classroom everyday life important one would think
Often I remark humorous computer science joke normal conversation help understand concept lot better
If competitive nature like I understand peer keep track progressing individual goal
They challenge perform best encourage fall behind peer well make damn sure worthy competitor challenge well
Find learning peer work well
Being friend important let become distracting guy study work together
Find someone driven learn computer science still patient ahead like helping problem set even finish
Availability crucial learning buddy expected meet regularly peer
Although strictly necessary really want solidify understanding concept generally closing gap understanding find someone worse computer science
By able explain idea clearly simply truly demonstrate world understand concept
You also give back community helped journey
Having community consist people fulfill role important often first failure point beginner
Without right type support student struggle unnecessary hardship
The chain command I follow come answering question go following Before I look help anywhere I tend try exhaust problem solving toolkit tool
I look tool tactic I teach Tactics see tool tactic solve
I explore path tactic evaluate current standing try different path
I move next chain command I exhausted possibility tool
Finding answer without trying answer question rob insight
You trouble remembering context problem nature problem constructed understand naturally lack complete understanding solution
After I come fruitless trying solve problem I leverage help internet
I google
StackOverflow best website answering programming question
I try come clean right terminology read several search result try find I looking
I give much advice
Many people know Google expertise come practice
Now lost usually know right terminology obscure question find peer pool together insight
If afraid bothering people like I still remember peer benefit solving problem much asking question situation consider well people ask help
Working problem peer create sounding board insight
It cumulative collective knowledge power collaboration
It help tremendously
I always ask help presenting problem accurately easy possible state exactly getting stuck approach I taken far tackling issue
It facilitate open communication common understanding problem
Ask voice thought loud
Their interpretation problem initial reaction thought
Then ask plan extracting information problem solve
Take thought jumbled mess confused rephrase back understand going
Point obstacle discus get around
If still lost point time go ask mentor
To maintain good relationship mentor regularly meet even specific question
Mentors still friend talk
It also equally important big burden mentor
Everyone patience finite rely mentor carry way soon find
Ask question ask question context
There dumb question prepared question unprepared question
An example prepared question although may dumb How variable Python work
I trying understand list stored memory
I tried Googling read article language I still quite understand Asking question context demonstrates several point mentor Asking good question help sustain good relationship mentor
Make sure thank mentor every time help
Before I take new learning endeavor first strategy always try find cheap way experiment
Richard Feynman Nobel Prize winner Physics always advocated opportunity play experiment thing learning
In computer science mean writing code subsequently debugging
Having debugging tool allows u better peer program see going
If know debug code know tool order robbing great tool teacher
If wondering debugging tool mean asking right question
In programming language I learn class I take I seek answer question right bat Let say taking algorithm class instead writing code algorithm learned theory
No way testing whether work
How confident would write algorithm learned class internship
Therefore learning anything first question I verify I taught true In chemistry lab test tube mathematics proof
In computer science computer code
Setting computer write run code like setting chemistry lab run experiment
You need right equipment right litmus test right ingredient
You perhaps download certain software editor
Whatever learning try find convenient way able write test code
Get text editor I started actually switched I got Macbook
Now going many different faction programmer telling best
They tell Vim best stay true Emacs
Whatever say ignore
Having functional editor method around optimality please please let best editor decision prevent writing code
That probably stupidest failure point one journey learning computer science
Pick one move
You always switch later
Find error handled code
Different programming language different way handling error
Some programming language silent error others tell exactly fucked
Sometimes error ignored time break whole program even crash computer
Knowing know error produced help know going know messed fix problem learn
Ask mentor get stuck say What program I bug
How I know whether I bug I generally try find print thing inside code
Usually something called print statement
In Python print Your Message Here
In Java Your Message Here
In Javascript completely different language Java way Your Message Here
My first job learning print thing onto computer whether output terminal browser
Once know print thing debugging much easier
You able tell value certain variable certain point program value put function exactly code among thing
Print statement get way debugging tool may vary programming language programming language
I would generally quick Google search see debugging ask mentor
Computer science educational subject requires deliberate practice application
It need practice application get computer science education
Deliberate practice includes problem set homework
It process solidifies understanding particular concept tool
Application hand solidifies connection solving problem
In deliberate practice problem seeking solution
In application solution preparing right problem come
Let demonstrate mean example
Let say trying learn recursion intro computer science class
Your instructor give assignment maybe even project help solidify understanding recursion
It involves calculating factorial number among problem recursion difficult
You complete assignment Yes I learned recursion Yes learned recursion
You know enough pas test know tested
But know whether recursion could help solve problem encounter summer internship
You least easily conceivable
If someone gave question month later How I count number way make dollar coin would know recursion right way go
Well sure occur many beginner answer YES
That I believe seeking problem solve learned concept would strengthen understanding concept well put right connection cue would trigger Recursion
Recursion
You solve recursion head
Well would systematically go applying understanding
There several way
The first finding personal project
Find problem need solving ask often possible Can I solve using concept I learned If tackle
Make second nature recognize tool useful
At club I involved Hackers Berkeley use concept learn class workshop online tackle challenge always wanted solve
Hence produce best computer science student one join one become Thiel Fellows land fantastic job internship great company
Metacognition
After complete problem set take minute two examine nature problem presented
Ask Usually form problem presented Find pattern occur among problem encountered past
For recursion might think Well recursion problem presented act building complexity simple Therefore see problem seem grand nature know think recursion
Developing hunch greatly helpful problem solving really keeping computer science education past class
That I really strategy
Building community able find answer developing right habit really thing need great computer scientist
You make commitment
Tactics method tackling new problem
The difference great problem solver normal student even though party stuck new problem great problem solver rarely idle stare problem
Usually making form discovery testing form conjecture
They always avenue discover new concept behind problem new pattern
Always discovering always progressing
Having good tactic solving problem help learn faster also give edge tackling new problem
There inherent appeal computer science curiosity always fulfilled
Unlike subject like biology chemistry need lab financial accounting need year experience management let handle money computer science need discover something new laptop
That mother tool getting hand dirty
Experimentation always yield fruitful result understanding computer science
I explain concept Getting Your Hands Dirty GYHD using famous example used Paul Zeitz book video course The Art Craft Problem Solving Q A knock door asks woman inside many child old
I three daughter age whole number product age say mother
That enough information responds
I tell sum age still I wish tell something Okay older daughter Annie like Of course first look would stumped
What
I first thought There way I could extract new information I decided give regret I paid attention spent time trying solve
I gotten hand dirty
A Some may picked hint get hand dirty
Well let
Let list product product
They listed Many would still stumped let take GYHD step list sum least know answer one choice
You quickly find two option sum
Those two two pair ambiguity exist
If woman daughter age telling sum would NOT stumped census taker two possibility
As bonus treat riddle figure answer correct notice mother say Older daughter mean exists oldest The age daughter must
We would never arrived answer know possible solution outset
We would never know dug little deeper explored little see information current information provide
In computer science particularly test technical interview often asked solve problem quickly us le time efficiently us le memory
A tip Cracking Coding Interview Gayle Laakmann suggests come best solution come le ideal solution
Why
Because often question difficult enough see best answer right away
Having stepping stone le ideal solution crucial reaching final destination
Many question series stepping stone
Usually easiest conceive called Brute Let example demonstrate thought process go solving question
I modified problem make understandable CS beginner
Q If given tile numbered shuffled bag duplicate number bag giving number find duplicate number efficiently
For sake people understand time complexity space complexity I simplify objective question
Time Complexity How many mathematical operation must
Space Complexity How many tile remembered give point
Let say remember tile lay table
Well let try styled answer
Well definition duplicate mean already occurring
Let take letter one one one take compare tile laid table lay table
If find duplicate stop
Although solves problem correctly always give u correct answer task finding duplicate inefficient
Every tile take comparison last one
If duplicate last time would done comparison taking space
Let try better
For bag number tile N duplicate making N comparison N space
You notice since number occurs except duplicate must one space number tile
So draw square grid table tile take place exactly tile
mean column row
So forth
You stop place tile onto square
Now always take space place tile guaranteed find solution try
Let see even better
Now see anything special
Well notice sum always stay matter scrambled always add
Whatever duplicate plus duplicate number
So take piece paper
Every time take tile add tile number number paper
Then chuck tile away
Do tile left number
Subtract number given duplicate want
Since even care order anymore relied sum remember one number time sum number
The number computation always number number save whole lot space without keep track many number
It hard see perfect solution get go
Nothing would prompted anyone inexperienced add everything subtract
Only using stepping stone solution getting hand dirty could reached satisfactory point
So get hand dirty
Do providing example example succeed example fail
Provide solution solution fail solve problem solution solve problem solution solve problem effectively
Learn attempt
Simplification come two form simplification problem simplification example
Simplification method edging closer solution finding tangible pattern problem
Actionable simplification help come good pattern help problem solve
I fantastic professor discrete mathematics Shoutout Professor Sahai UCB gave u difficult question solve instead harsh resentful type professor rewarded partial credit student solve simplified form question
He said lecture If solve problem try taking condition away original problem solve easier one
Once solved start adding back condition back see fails examine thing fail Sahai Brilliant concept practice type problem solve used time engineering
If go way let go see go Here example simplification problem taken final discrete mathematics class
Q While ﬁghting GLaDOS Chell start origin x plane every second move distance exactly meter direction
The direction independently chosen every second
After n second R Chell distance origin E R
E R expected value distance square also known variance distribution
When I first saw problem I panicked
I know start go
However I resorted simplifying problem helped made significant progress
Let suppose instead choosing uniform direction random could choose direction North East South West
Let solve expected distance original n second
To break choice change x change
Either going move x direction move direction precisely meter
So expected distance x direction one sec variance Var X E X X
In similar fashion variance distance per second also
Since want variance distance origin x also add variance result n expected value
I realized North East South West special case equation Θ Θ Interestingly enough X uniform distribution Θ Likewise By independence Also think unit circle trigonometry
Therefore using linearity expectation It ok understand explanation lot discrete mathematics learn someday
Just remember simplifying problem case helped understand question coherently I took away condition solved easier problem see helped solve complicated version
Q What expected number Facebook friend birthday every single day year
For simplicity sake assume leap year assume friend equal probability distribution land given date
Expected number case restate like Assuming X number friend
There chance X friend occupied every day calendar chance
Find X
Well tough problem tackle
Where even start
Usually people think bottom line got least people right
One every day I go
What never land particular date
Do I calculate chance well
Gahhh
A The answer becomes clear simplify example
Let say one day year want know many friend take occupy year
One course
Well
Well first person could occupy day want long second person
That make chance landing correct date
From geometric series lesson worry know expected outcome take successful outcome p probability desired outcome
Since chance second person different first I flipping coin expected outcome
So take one person occupy date average people occupy day total expected outcome
See going
With day year calculate successive expected value
The first person landing date one landed expected outcome second filled date chance landing square landed expected outcome
The last vacant date need average friend fill
So build inductive step notice pattern therefore way simplify
It seems n day first day second third way
So solution summation term n example turn friend
Often tackling problem head overwhelming
It often easier break problem smaller problem solve smaller problem independently stitch back together either gracefully recognizing pattern among various solution using conditional statement
Here example problem I encountered phone interview I messed badly phone interview I went back several month later problem solving mindset solve
Q Given list interval mathematical function defined another interval called target interval return list interval intersect target interval
Here example Defined interval I want interval target interval It return Really interested bracket space inside bracket
We trying find intersection first second line bracket given interval target interval
On phone interview
I treated every given interval
I tried test one see target interval partly
I messed really badly
I made overly complicated therefore program failed
Here proposed insight answer
A Not bracket
There bracket inside target interval two edge bracket test see partly target interval
Moving left right always unaffected interval middle part result question
Therefore take interval completely inside target interval test interval direct edge encompassed interval see partially intersect target interval
Here pseudocode written solve problem There
Done
I broke interval four case handled case separately
Some tool come handy I provide example
By knowing tactic recognize show strengthen toolkit
When I stuck I ask problem similar problem I solved
I look similar problem reflect I solved
I use insight required solved previously solved problem solve new one
Sometimes I think backwards start solution
I think elusive variable solution manipulate fit condition problem
Of course many many problem solving tactic
I named favorite common one used computer science
You acquire
Some day face problem tackle
You learn solve reflect solved realize Hey I found new approach problem And find joy joy resulting knowing better understanding problem better understanding future problem well
Give pat back
Learning tool often topic focus often least efficiency acquisition
My framework acquire tool adaptation simplification several different source information
Each resource tradeoff notably level mastery amount time commitment
Here two objective relation computer science justify methodology I use
Since focus computer science I focusing adjusting learning style take advantage two thing unique computer science abstraction testability
Abstraction computer science mean many computer science concept terminology abstracted used metaphor
It intuitive subject easy pick could explain popular
The beauty computer science extremely testable
Have question computer science
time easily test
Therefore main focus learning tool Scott Young methodology Holistic Learning
Scott taken year worth MIT computer science course one year passed
Through experience developed framework learning anything
I adapted appended commentary taken personal experience taken framework learning
The focus approach outlined book Young break learning process distinct step
The first step called visceralization
Visceralization process taking something feel unfamiliar becoming familiar
Every new concept learn start unfamiliar relationship concept
It mysterious almost arbitrary poorly understood
To achieve mastery concept must shed light
Tim Ferris author Four Hour Chef would consider stage If concept hard grasp try using several different problem solving tactic simplification
The extreme principle help significantly
See happens take concept limit
If recursion try working backwards end state problem
If equation form algorithm trying plugging extreme value like really large number seeing happens
The extreme principle Paul Zeitz The Art Craft Problem Solving would put reduces degree freedom problem It help lot limit concept take bit bit
Of course application extreme principle form tactic Getting Your Hands Dirty always used learn new tool
If mathematical proof follow proof understand proof derive
If certain concept like recursion understand visually
Use diagram picture sound gesture whatever take get intuitive feel
Claw get frustrated discus mull maybe cry desperation sleep top usually time feel natural
Afterwards build model metaphor
In word take know explain thing
In computer science really easy make metaphor thing
Before take right approach let check wrong approach
Let check formal definition variable Wikipedia defined A storage location associated symbolic name identifier contains known unknown quantity information It might make sense average computer scientist novice mean NOTHING
WTF storage location
Is hard drive
A
Symbolic name
WTF
Are talking hieroglyphic
Unknown quantity
What mean
There coherency adhere
Nothing mind stick
It accurate sure going take serious effort people figure
Now try explanation
A variable like named box put information Before technical geek jump throat please bear least past Exploration section I yard headstart kidding
The explanation continues You box named myName put word James writing Now explanation make much sense
variable like box store information
That make Having metaphor strengthen understanding concept make fun
It novel relationship brings easy understanding
Instead saying A stack type data structure First In Last Out
First last
FIFO FIFO trying drill head remember A stack like pancake You get bottom pancake eat top one
If want extend box analogy imagine stack box
You certainly open bottom box take top one
That actually data structure stack work
You access variable bottom stack pop one
Metaphors fun
They help u remember

It metaphor concept accessible digestible easy remember
Almost every explanation involves metaphor every ELIAMA IS metaphor
Browse sometime check creative people explaining concept easy remember certain thing well thing fit
Of course metaphor perfect
It even good
That exploration come
In exploration stage test model
You poke model bit see happens
Does collapse
Does stand test
Where metaphor fall
Where shine
The common method exploration problem set
You take belief certain concept use answer question
There find exception thought rule
You find rule thing thought exception
You find inconsistency model learn fix model sturdy fort
After problem set maybe problem set exploration
Feed curiosity
If followed analogy earlier using box represent variable ask question I provided method test find answer
They exhaustive
There way answer explore question course come new one You find putting really large number variable
You ask someone would happen
You many box check computer memory space
You google
Preferably ask friend
Try assigning variable name different thing printing computer
Do original item new one
Do
Then ask question Is true item put What put rope tied another box
I answer right pointer reference
You try answer assigning two variable A B respectively
If say mean putting thing another box metaphor mean put box B box See happens print print B ERROR
Just question I tell print Then ask Well case box B box A Did box B transfer box A Then print box B content
Phew seems like box transfer content box A
The first question may able answer conventional programming Google ask someone
There many question ask metaphor box describe variable
Jumping back metaphor second student would conceived question beforehand imagined visualized variable named box
The student would fumbled around figuring variable exactly without allowing curiosity guide exploration
These example question legitimate question variable whether form formal terminology language metaphor
They dumb question
If metaphor help student understand concept think better mean use metaphor
By end one question pretty special type box metaphor one point encapsulated understand subject enough need metaphor anymore
Use opportunity create favorite metaphor
Your metaphor keep
It like inside joke
You able see concept learning much clearer
You able enjoy constructing sound metaphor bulletproof
Then able tell friend peer Hey I realized array like vending provide reasonable argument
All right right
I drop wisdom
Since reading guide trying learn methodology I use really Scott Young system teach system
Ok Learning concept like playing Pokemon
First catch Pokemon
The process catching pokemon process visceralization
You see claw poke deconstruct encapsulate pokeball
Once basic model
You take pokemon train nurture
You feed scoop poop despite fact might still take bed sleeping bag
You learn skill shortcoming stats
You work spend time
Ok ok take pokemon test
In tribute generation pokemon Pewter Gym Brock gym
Then say Go Pikachu
Fight Onix If defeat leader great
You earned badge mastered concept
If train pokemon try
If pokemon model fails many time maybe time let go
Maybe took try realize Onix impervious electric type Pokemons
So let go Pikachu pick new pokemon preferably Squirtle try
By time defeat gym leader fantastic new Pokemon neat badge show awesome online course badge day
They probably caught
Below roadmap based personal computer science learning journey UC Berkeley computer science curriculum
It based semester really mean much besides general chronological order thing You learn basic programming concept well dip foot world programming
I find Learn Python Hard Way best teaching semester
Use checklist make sure learn concept
Don move concept Python encapsulated learn data structure
Java better way go
I find UC Berkeley best way go
You find resource material exercise class
You implement thing take granted Semester Java
Email I even try get Piazza group live support community UCB student taking class super duper helpful people keeping track
Here semester checklist Also discrete math provides mathematical backing computer science education
Also really necessary I find helpful building repertoire problem solving tool tactic
Checklist With knowledge end second semester could probably score basic internship summer time
If lost suppose go semester general sense step take next
So I give roadmap proudly call computer scientist
You also license tell corny computer science joke like Q How programmer die shower
A He read shampoo bottle instruction Lather
Rinse
Repeat
If get come back semester treat enjoy I hope guide helpful
Now I must warn guide secret learning computer science
It sunshine rainbow I taught insider trick navigating away difficulty
You hardship
You frustration
You moment look everywhere help even able find
This guide meant teach avoid pain take easy path meant take hard path enjoy adventure
One night probably morning stuck library dorm room problem set due next day
You tired hungry gross feel lost hopeless
But think back guide think warning warning I made You hardship tell Hey ok I frustrated ok I lost
I prepared difficulty happen I began journey computer scientist I prepared Good luck
You succeed believe
I spent hour writing guide including countless hour reading book watching video experimenting learning style technique computer science intern summer
If enjoyed feel free drop line saying thanks
The best email one fundamentally impacted I write reason I write
If question comment concern reach I try best help direct someone
My email My Phone Number My friend said would good idea References listed poorly format
Starred reference material I recommend read want explore strategy accelerated learning

Your guide extremely helpful encouraging
Thank taking hour write
Do happen MS Word copy template resume
I really like layout
Thanks Hey Thx start course I Soo lucky come across
Thankyou much
thanks alot Hey James My Name Felipe I really intrsted learning Computer Science
Wat language u recommend begin
Thank posting
I novice computer science I really enjoyed article two reason
First since I working slowly Learning Python Hard Way metaphor explaining concept rang true
Second maybe important I appreciate reading perspective process learning
Maybe lucky meet work people UC Berkeley understand dry technical detail never matter accurate best place start novice subject
I think idea stem prejudice running deep North American culture people learn perhaps even deeper fear making mistake starting small
We disgusted condescend baby step extra large print dull teeming mass unwashed But another excuse bad teaching another excuse student planet give dream
As student I fought idea really weighed teacher I see silly idea pervasive almost every child I work
There truly deep well potential person I really understand faulty idea experience eye today kid knowing potential exists everywhere make reaching like article poignant
Informed source like article make difference digital age almost anyone internet access read inspired act
If embraced education way imagine leap stride u could take alone together
Thanks hard work
I started course I read article gave good understanding importance course career well Thanks article
I starting development blog coding happened something I stumbled upon journey creating site
I obsessed limitless possibility
This article superb detailed I wanted thank writing fueled learn coding

Top recommendation

It around time last year I began fret little
The novelty summer holiday started wear fear began settle
After couple year teaching ICT I getting little bored churning coursework looking new challenge would really make student think
Do get wrong ICT place I felt like student missing getting mix computer science ICT
So I came plan start delivering computing September
Having previously studied internet technology university taught ICT almost four year bit geek I felt quite secure subject knowledge computing feeling confident programming skill
The first thing thing I sign site user learn teach code free began working exercise
I chose Python coding language choice quite close written English plenty support material online
After week spending minute day working Python tutorial little often I decided attempt one GCSE programming project immediately became stuck
Online tutorial site great learning syntax programming language necessarily teach solve problem
This computational thinking come
After call help Twitter I quickly found tutored problem solving side thing via Skype email two amazing computer scientist
Problem solving essence computer science using computer tool solve real world problem
The way get good problem solving practice
Although I returned school September I still annual fear six week I actually quite excited get started
problem solving programming aspect computing provided really interesting contrast ICT I taught previously
My student felt success quicker gained confidence solving relatively simple problem whereas student came across something always get right first time
The lesson provided great platform differentiation task amazing see student take step back really think problem plan solution
One task I set student create program using Python take two number multiplies together print answer
At higher end student create calculator gave user option different thing depending option user chose
These problem tailored covered class topic variable data type selection
Students design solution paper code evaluate solution
There plenty time student got stuck usually logic error sometimes I know answer
So I advised I I know something use internet
Students started becoming quite proficient searching blog forum seek bit code would help
In hindsight I focused little much student learning syntax particular coding language rather embedding wider programming concept selection iteration something I going change approach upcoming school year
Also I found student responded well challenge solving problem rather following guide
Obviously need starting point tutorial site syntax guide give student
But I going start getting student thinking problem solving sooner see programming tool solving problem rather exercise must get right cost
I really glad I decided dive deep end computing
I believe student benefited much challenging engaging lesson subject matter computing tends lend
With computer science around u easy make link real world scenario student relate
Above I want student challenged lesson enjoy I think computing provides u great platform achieve

This video present Time CS Elementary curriculum development research project funded National Science Foundation NSF Partnership Exploratory Integration grant awarded Broward County Public Schools Florida
The purpose project develop model integration es unit integrate computer science grade
Research finding presented well lesson learned work CS curriculum development CS professional development CS school teacher support well success CS integration elementary level
Absolutely wonderful integration different subject student learning variety project
The video show example digital literacy use computer research computational thinking
Are key computer science concept student learning well
Hi Jennie Thank feedback
We deliberate key CS concept integrated grade level
The grade progress concept course Code Studio CS Fundamentals grade grade progress course bit course
CS concept introduced need know basis keep integrated approach
For example concept EVENT essential developing interactive artifact part culminating CS project three grade level
This Time CS project tackle constraint instructional time elementary day interdisciplinary instruction integrates computer science science social study providing context
The impact reflected positive response engagement student bit difficult engage teacher
Our initial reaction teacher think idea good skeptical ability change teaching interdisciplinary approach especially adding CS subject totally new
What perceive challenge approach teacher student administration curriculum point view
instructional time constraint surely get way teacher trying new better hope way promising way introduce computer science concept
While student progress three grade make sure grade teacher example know Grade content expect student belt grade content follow
Sally This interesting question
Do school participate project entire school
Or teacher sign participate individual teacher
A coherent system grade CS followed grade CS followed grade CS surely optimal would require
We definitely working formula
It become school culture
We selected school participate treatment school grade class school participated project
Our school diverse student demographic exists different area district largest nation
We trained team grade level unit professional development focused specific module two module per grade level teacher given access module material grade level
One member grade level school selected act designee communicate grade level school aware curriculum help plan integration
teacher grade level participate allowed plan together share idea integration CS
It allowed feel confident struggled new CS concept someone could turn support clarification
The administration school supportive curriculum CS integration
They assigned school designee facilitate communication school team
The literacy coach attended professional development formed supportive cohort could share information school support ELA integration science social study
Finally invited special teacher art medium science etc
attend professional development contribute integration curriculum beyond main classroom
All member team given access curriculum well facilitate common language support
This level systemic sound great
You write initiative
Has project come end
Are school still implementing
Schools still implementing module end June week implementation
Then data analysis
Good luck
In developing program grade teacher found many thing teacher already class science concept embedded
idea place value math taught decimal binary integrated well
Are looking similar content relationship subject
I really like idea EVENT included grade
A great way build concept eventually lead something much complicated
Very Intresting
Thank
It wonderful working grade teacher student total diverse background
We impressed student engagement support teacher administrator CS integration
I love discussed
I think important young student consider learning code something student
Great job
I intrigued industry partnership
I curious whether suggestion regard building partnership entity
How ensure student data privacy
Or perception outside entity influencing school decision
Hi Kip We district Partnership Outlier research partner
All data anonymized share data analysis
Same true partnership
We district project lead keeper data everything run IRB addition IRB UChicago deliberate attention student privacy

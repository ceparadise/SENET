An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

use predefined programming modular unit object class subclass forth order make programming faster easier maintain
language help manage complexity large program
Objects package data operation operation publicly accessible internal detail data structure hidden
This information hiding made programming easier allowing programmer think part program isolation
In addition object may derived general one inheriting capability
Such object made possible define specialized object without repeating general one
programming began Simula language added information hiding
Another influential language Smalltalk program set object interacted sending message one another
Since one successful language

I get long
Any alternative word similar easier understand
For explain instance
instance like example normal people world
I ca understand I even got meaning
instance best understood relates class programming
Classes used define property behavior thing

A Car class might dictate car defined make model year mileage
But cant provide specific particular car example Chevy Impala mile uncle Mickey drive create instance Car
It capture detailed information one particular Car
An object object reference object
Here pretty standard definition An instance programming OOP specific realization object
An object may varied number way
Each realized variation object instance
The creation realized instance called instantiation
Each time program run instance program
In language create object class object instantiation class
That member given class specified value rather variable
In context could think dog class particular dog instance class
Here good conversation instance may help An instance basically object
In actual english mean differently
In case instance english mean Refer
These object instance programming also reference source code
Going outside world programming second know people
You instance class people I talk people general class object I specific one mind I talk instance
An instance property automatically consequence member class
All human heart human name date birth
I hope clear bit
Loosely speaking making thing pattern
A class pattern creating object
The object created instance class
A function template pattern creating function
The function created instance template
This usually done implicitly referred implicit instantiation
A class template pattern creating class
The class created instance template
simple example blueprint class represents student object field like name age course class member
And student Foo Bob
So Foo Bob different instance class Student class represent object Student people
far understood instance pointer object class
p could wrong
To understand instance must first understand class
A simply modeling tool provided programming language use representing real world object program application
The class structured accommodate object member variable member
An hand simply variation object created class
You create object variant using method within class specifically defined purpose
Consider Car wanted represent application would define class identified Car contains property car operation car perform
It would look something close supposing done Java programming language Create instance car BMW instance car

I heard concept used frequently I really good grasp
Converting object memory format written disk sent wire etc

I beg differ Wikipedia pretty clear
In computer science marshalling similar serialization process transforming memory representation object data format suitable storage transmission
It typically used data must moved different part computer program one program another
People defined marshalling quite clearly already I skip definition jump example
Remote procedure call us marshalling
When invoking remote function marshall argument kind standard format transport across network
I clarified google search data marshalling first hit pretty good
The gist transform data back forth form thing like transmission network
The problem solves ca really transmit data network form usable program
You solve number issue including thing like endianness data store complex data type like string etc
Marshalling solve network transmission problem problem going one architecture another maybe different language especially might use thing like virtual machine translation problem
process transforming memory representation object data format could stored transmitted
It also called although could different certain context
The memory representation object could stored binary XML format suitable storage transmission way allows unmarshal get original object back
For example usage online game client server component wanted send player object containing player stats world coordinate client server way around could simply marshal client send network unmarshal end would appear server object created server
Here ruby example Marshalling process transferring data across application boundary different data format
Marshalling common example writing data disk database technically marshalling however term tends used describe data conversion foreign APIs interprocess communication
For example communicating managed unmanaged code accessing certain APIs likely require marshalling order convert back forth managed C object style object structs handle output buffer etc
The help static might helpful
Basically expression generically transforming object similar another representation
sent wire stored disk typically string binary stream
The opposite unmarshalling describes opposite direction reading marshalled representation object whatever existed earlier
Another current everyday example JSON In generic sense programming simply mean taking data one format transforming format acceptable
It mean turning data another data type transfer another system
marshalling struct XML document send webservice marshalling pointer send different thread apartment

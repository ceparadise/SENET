To successfully control several process core operating system make utilize known interrupt
Interrupt machine used implementing multitasking concept
It signal hardware software point incidence event
When one process running similar time user give additional process interrupt take place
If CPU poll control bit instead receives interrupt device ready next byte data transfer said interrupt driven
A hardware interrupt occurs operation done analysis data computer tape drive
In additional term hardware interrupt used device communicate need awareness operating system
Some familiar example hard disk signaling read sequence data block network device processed buffer containing network packet
Interrupts also worn asynchronous event appearance new data exterior network
Hardware interrupt delivered straight CPU via little network interrupt administration routing device
Hardware interrupt referenced interrupt numeral
These statistic mapped back section hardware produced interrupt
This enables system monitor device formed interrupt occurred
In computer system interrupt handled speedily possible
When interrupt acknowledged recent action blocked interrupt handler executed
The handler anticipate supplementary running program system action entire system generate latency
MRG modifies way interrupt handled array progress performance reduce latency
A software interrupt occurs application program terminates need definite service operating system
Software interrupt generated contained processor executing instruction
Software interrupt frequently used implemented system call implemented subroutine call CPU ring stage modify
The timed interrupt worn convinced event MUST happen specified frequency
An interrupt vector memory address interrupt handler directory group called interrupt vector table dispatch table
Interrupt vector table include memory address interrupt handler
When interrupt generated processor save completing state context switch begin effecting interrupt handler interrupt vector
A Microkernel try run majority service like networking file system etc
All left kernel essential service like memory allocation scheduling messaging Inter Process Communication
IPC Hardware Server Kernel In theory model make kernel additional receptive since large amount functionality resides traceable thread process removing require kernel proper improves constancy kernel reducing quantity code running kernel space
There also supplementary benefit OS carry computer much simpler reentrancy security better correctness asynchronous functionality distributed OS code use service without knowing service contributor running similar computer
A disadvantage sum messaging Context Switching concerned make microkernel conceptually slower monolithic kernel
A modular kernel effort combine excellent point driver moderator driver
In modular kernel part system core situated autonomous file called module additional system run time
Depending substance module aim differ loading driver device fact establish load file system get really requested load code precise scheduling security policy evaluated
The modular kernel approach requires subsystem interrelate suspiciously constructed interface naturally narrow condition functionality showing external module
The layered kernel move toward similar admiration
However layered kernel imposes firm ordering subsystem subsystem subordinate layer allowed appeal operation parallel subsystem
There limitation approach wherein module open invoke including constraint
Context switching occurs single process provisionally discontinues execution additional process resume execution position
Context switching performed scheduler
To give process machine light contribute CPU hardware clock generates interrupt every often
This allows operating system program every process core memory via scheduling algorithm run CPU interval
Every time clock interrupt occurs interrupt handler check much time recent running process used
If used total time segment CPU scheduling algorithm kernel pick dissimilar process run
Each switch CPU one process new called context switch
Actions taken kernel context switch surrounded thread
The thread contribute lot resource peer thread belonging equal process
So context switch along thread similar process effortless
It involves switch register position program counter along stack
It comparatively easy kernel achieve task
Actions taken kernel context switch among Processes
Context switch among process exclusive
Ahead process switched PCB process control block saved operating system
The PCB consists subsequent information The process state program counter principle different register The CPU scheduling information process Memory organization information concerning process Possible accounting information process status information process
When PCB presently executing process saved operating system load PCB subsequently process performing CPU
This important job take lot time
System call function programmer call perform service operating system
Processes run user mode process library cause execution kernel mode
The interface two mode provided system call
These function call cause request made kernel kernel execute behalf request
Commands UNIX System Calls Libraries File Formats Games Device Drivers System Maintenance System call implemented operating system User execute privileged instruction
Users must ask OS execute system call
System call often implemented using trap
OS gain control trap switch supervisor model performs service switch back client mode give control back client
The dual mode operation provides u resource protecting operating system erroneous user
User mode monitor mode two mode
Monitor mode also called superintendent mode system mode privileged mode
Mode bit attached hardware computer point toward present mode
In argument mode bit monitor mode mode bit user mode
An application program interface precise technique set computer operating system application program programmer scripting application program create requirement operating system different application
An application program interface contrasted graphical user interface command interface direct user interface interface operating system program
For example The service provide interface application protocol software
Application Network API Protocol A Protocol B Protocol C In computer system variety memory address space user space kernel space technique system provided communicating data
A data structure distinct kernel space stock data
The data structure nearly mapped application user space application contact data structure via virtual memory address
By directly accessing data structure data transfer address space using system call interrupt reduced
Process scheduling method used limited asset many process competing Multiprogramming try make sure number process running time
This completed utilize CPU much possible
In timesharing system CPU switch regularly job user experience machine mutual many process even several user
Long term scheduler determines program admitted system processing
It control degree multiprogramming
Once admitted job becomes process
Medium term scheduling division exchange utility
This relate process blocked suspended state
They swapped prepared execute
The decision based criterion
Short term scheduler also known dispatcher executes regularly make conclusion process execute subsequently
This scheduler invoked whenever occasion occurs
It may direct interruption one process
The state process distinct fraction present activity process
Each process may one following state New Running Waiting Ready Terminated These state name random differ across operating system
The state correspond establishing operating system however
Certain operating system finely describe process state
Only one process running processor immediate although numerous process may ready waiting

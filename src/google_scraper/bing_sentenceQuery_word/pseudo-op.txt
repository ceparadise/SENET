Writing pseudocode assignment asks convert number penny collected dollar cent BUT displaying seperate line
I understand sort sign divide return integer result whole number discard fraction Mod divide return remainder integer dicard whole part number
However I stumped write exactly display separetly
I understand declaration input I really need help part
Thanks
This anything pseudocode really belong computer science
It sound like problem particular language
See psudocode basically writting code english defined standard
You seemed language spesific term floating around
To print something differe line SAY printing different line english
There nothing else
Do need help creating formula dollar cent
Show u help fix formula
Actually I problem
The one previously discussed I wrote pseudocode formula Set Dollars discard fractional part show Dollars I going Set Dollars Pennies discard whole number
Is right write one formula print dollar cent seperately suggested
How would I display seperately
Secondly I working Raptor program future value compounded quarterly formula given FutureValue PresentValue
I getting incorrect answer
Grr
I going try take year see somehow make work
Any help greatly appreciated feel like I may gotten head class
Your arithemetic correct
fine
Your overwritting Dollars
Store Pennies somewhere else
You display seperately saying different line
I know much easier get
If still confused Or anything effect
I care
No one reading psuedocode care
I getting incorrect answer
Pardon incorrect answer
The possibility You typed calculator wrong Your calculator broken You messed calculation hand
If market I personally think IIS best generally accepted University math
Though operating system come ok calculator interpreter used good calculator
Then entered wrong raptor
I entered I stated
I know work
FutureValue PresentValue Years
It accept without actual multiplication symbol either
This nothing computer science pseudocode
This programming formula raptor whatever
I guessing want use multiplication symbol
Also I idea would support either
It might
It might even provide exponentiation
Try reading documentation
Generally find tutorial somewhere online youtube
RAPTOR programming environment designed specifically help student visualize algorithm avoid syntactic baggage
RAPTOR program created visually executed visually tracing execution flowchart
Required syntax kept minimum
Students prefer using flowchart express algorithm successful creating algorithm using RAPTOR using traditional language writing flowchart without RAPTOR
This chosen way learn write code school I attend
If problem raptor start new thread either Software Development Legacy Languages name environment title

Pseudocode way writing code
It used design phase project quick way devising algorithm language used known without needing spend much time using exact syntax correct
Once pseudocode algorithm written easier use help write program code
Pseudocode structured way writing algorithm look much like program code
When devising algorithm programmer need use variable assign value
Many language require variable defined given data type use
The five basic data type used include Assigning value variable indicated pseudocode using arrow symbol
The arrow point value assigned towards variable assigned
The following line pseudocode read becomes equal
totalling
Sum Sum Number counting
Count Count The assignment operator also used finding total shown following example x becomes equal plus b
Similarly also use assignment operator counting assigning variable become equal value plus
INPUT OUTPUT
READ PRINT Output act returning data user program
This could form written message numerical value image video sound
This shown pseudocode writing OUTPUT followed output
The example show would output message World Sometimes word PRINT may used instead OUTPUT following example Input hand expect value provided user
The following example output message asking user input name assign variable called
The word READ also used instead INPUT
The use selection allows decision made within algorithm based certain condition
An IF statement start condition tested
If condition evaluates TRUE THEN code block run
If condition evaluates false ELSE block run
In following example Hello printed x otherwise Goodbye printed
Often ELSE IF used one condition check
The following example would print Hello x How
x otherwise print Goodbye
This structure used many possible outcome condition
For instance extend example suppose wanted program print different message depending value variable xː In example x print Hello x How
x I fine
x print Have good dayǃ
If x equal anything else print Goodbye
Iteration used need repeat block code
We make code block repeat either given number repetition continuously either long condition continues true condition becomes true
The FOR loop used repeat code given number repetition
We specify counter variable set initial value specify end value
After every iteration loop counter variable automatically incremented
In following example x start increase every time code repeat reach value loop terminate
A REPEAT loop repeat code block given condition true
The condition checked code run regardless whether condition true code always run least
The following example continue take user input user input value le
This structure often used validation check
In WHILE loop code block run continue run given condition longer true
A WHILE loop similar REPEAT loop decides terminate based condition
However loop check condition prior running first time
If condition true code block never run
The example also used input validation
Flowcharts alternative pseudocode
They used describe algorithm form diagram
Different symbol used represent different structure described
Below example flowchart algorithm

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

A close look fault help geologist understand tectonic plate moved relative one another
Types movement crustal block occur along fault earthquake University Otago Richard Sibson
Where crust pulled apart occurs overlying block move respect lower foot wall block

Where crust compressed occurs block move footwall block reverse slip gently inclined plane referred thrust faulting

Crustal block may also move sideways past usually along fault
This movement described sinistral far side move left dextral far side move right

An involves various combination basic movement Wairarapa Fault rupture included reverse dextral movement
COM pg

Faults short metre long
The fault rupture earthquake always straight continuous line
Sometimes short offset part fault even major fault large bend

property enables continue operating properly event failure one fault within component
If operating quality decrease decrease proportional severity failure compared naively designed system even small failure cause total breakdown
Fault tolerance particularly sought
The ability maintaining functionality portion system break referred
A enables system continue intended operation possibly reduced level rather failing completely part system
The term commonly used describe designed continue le fully operational perhaps reduction increase event partial failure
That system whole stopped due problem either
An example another field motor vehicle designed continue drivable one tire punctured structure able retain integrity presence damage due cause manufacturing flaw impact
Within scope system fault tolerance achieved anticipating exceptional condition building system cope general aiming system converges towards state
However consequence system failure catastrophic cost making sufficiently reliable high better solution may use form duplication
In case consequence system failure catastrophic system must able use reversion fall back safe mode
This similar recovery human action human present loop
A highly system might continue level performance even though one component failed
For example building backup electrical generator provide voltage wall outlet even grid power fails
A system designed whether function reduced level fails completely way protects people property data injury damage intrusion disclosure
In computer program might executing opposed uncontrolled crash order prevent data corruption experiencing error
A similar distinction made failing well
opposite strategy used weapon system designed kill injure target even part system damaged destroyed
A system designed experience used computing similar fail safe operates reduced level performance component failure
For example building may operate lighting reduced level elevator reduced speed grid power fails rather either trapping people dark completely continuing operate full power
In computing example graceful degradation insufficient network bandwidth available stream online video version might streamed place version
example computing web page available basic functional format older web browser enhanced version browser capable handling additional technology larger display available
In program considered designed continue operation despite error exception invalid input instead crashing completely
opposite robustness
continue transmit data despite failure link node likewise expected prevent complete failure situation like earthquake flood collision
A system high alert user component failure occurred even continues operate full performance failure repaired imminent complete failure anticipated
Likewise component designed report first point failure rather allow downstream component fail generate report
This allows easier diagnosis underlying problem may prevent improper operation broken state
Redundancy provision functional capability would unnecessary environment
This consist backup component automatically kick one component fail
For example large cargo truck lose tire without major consequence
They many tire one tire critical exception front tire used steer generally carry le load total four le likely fail
The idea incorporating redundancy order improve reliability system pioneered
Two kind redundancy possible space redundancy time redundancy
Space redundancy provides additional component function data item unnecessary operation
Space redundancy classified hardware software information redundancy depending type redundant resource added system
In time redundancy computation data transmission repeated result compared stored copy previous result
The current terminology kind testing referred Service Fault Tolerance Testing ISFTT short
Providing design every component normally option
Associated redundancy brings number penalty increase weight size power consumption cost well time design verify test
Therefore number choice examined determine component fault tolerant An example component pass test car occupant restraint system
While normally think occupant restraint system
If vehicle roll undergoes severe primary method occupant restraint may fail
Restraining occupant accident absolutely critical safety pas first test
Accidents causing occupant ejection quite common pas second test
The cost redundant restraint method like seat belt quite low economically term weight space pas third test
Therefore adding seat belt vehicle excellent idea
Other supplemental restraint system expensive pas test smaller margin
Another excellent example principle put practice braking system whilst actual brake mechanism critical particularly prone sudden rather progressive failure case necessarily duplicated allow even balanced application brake force wheel
It would also prohibitively costly main component would add considerable weight
However similarly critical system actuating brake driver control inherently le robust generally using cable rust stretch jam snap hydraulic fluid leak boil develop bubble absorb water thus lose effectiveness
Thus modern car footbrake hydraulic brake circuit diagonally divided give two smaller point failure loss either reducing brake power causing much dangerous brakeforce imbalance straight split hydraulic circuit fail completely relatively rare occurrence failsafe form parking brake operates otherwise relatively weak rear brake still bring vehicle safe halt conjunction braking long demand line normal traffic flow
The culmulatively unlikely combination total footbrake failure need harsh braking emergency likely result collision still one lower speed would otherwise case
In comparison footpedal activated service brake parking brake le critical item unless used backup footbrake cause immediate danger found nonfunctional moment application
Therefore redundancy built per se typically us cheaper lighter le hardwearing cable actuation system suffice happens hill use footbrake momentarily hold vehicle still driving find flat piece road stop
Alternatively shallow gradient transmission shifted Park Reverse First gear transmission lock engine compression used hold stationary need include sophistication first bring halt
On motorcycle similar level provided simpler method firstly front rear brake system entirely separate regardless method activation cable rod hydraulic allowing one fail entirely whilst leaving unaffected
Secondly rear brake relatively strong compared automotive cousin even powerful disc sport model even though usual intent front system provide vast majority braking force overall vehicle weight central rear tyre generally larger grippier rider lean back put weight therefore allowing brake force applied wheel lock
On cheaper slower machine even front wheel use hydraulic disc extra brake force easier packaging rear usually primitive somewhat inefficient exceptionally robust drum thanks ease connecting footpedal wheel way importantly near impossibility catastrophic failure even rest machine like lot bike first year use point collapse neglected maintenance
The basic characteristic fault tolerance require In addition system characterized term planned service outage unplanned service outage
These usually measured application level hardware level
The figure merit called expressed percentage
For example system would statistically provide availability
system typically based concept redundancy
Spare component address first fundamental characteristic fault tolerance three way All implementation except RAID example us
A machine us replicated element operating parallel
At time replication element state
The input provided output expected
The output replication compared using voting circuit
A machine two replication element termed DMR
The voting circuit detect mismatch recovery relies method
A machine three replication element termed TMR
The voting circuit determine replication error vote observed
In case voting circuit output correct result discard erroneous version
After internal state erroneous replication assumed different two voting circuit switch DMR mode
This model applied larger number replication
machine easily made fully gate replication making state transition edge clock clock replication exactly phase
However possible build lockstep system without requirement
Bringing replication synchrony requires making internal stored state
They started fixed initial state reset state
Alternatively internal state one replica copied another replica
One variant DMR
Two replicated element operate lockstep pair voting circuit detects mismatch operation output signal indicating error
Another pair operates exactly way
A final circuit selects output pair proclaim error
requires four replica rather three TMR used commercially
design advantage obvious many disadvantage Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires broken part taken replaced new part system still operational computing known
Such system implemented single backup known represents vast majority system
In system long enough operator time fix broken device backup also fails
It help time failure long possible specifically required system
Fault tolerance notably successful computer application
built entire business machine used tolerance create system measured year
architecture may encompass also computer software example process
Data format may also designed degrade gracefully
example designed allowing new HTML entity ignored understand without causing document unusable
There difference fault tolerance system rarely problem
For instance system failure rate two hour per forty year therefore highly
But fault occur still stopped operating completely therefore

system designed around concept
In essence must able continue working level satisfaction presence fault
Fault tolerance property individual machine may also characterise rule interact
For example TCP designed allow reliable communication even presence communication link imperfect overloaded
It requiring endpoint communication packet loss duplication reordering corruption condition damage data integrity reduce throughput proportional amount
Recovery error system characterised either
When system detects made error recovery take system state time corrects able move forward
recovery reverts system state back earlier correct version example using move forward
recovery requires operation checkpoint detected erroneous state made
Some system make use recovery different error different part one error
Most designed handle several possible failure including fault failure failure temporary permanent failure error interface error hardware software including failure operator error erroneous keystroke bad command sequence installing unexpected software physical damage flaw introduced system outside source
Hardware common application system designed prevent failure due hardware component
Most basically provided particularly
Typically component multiple backup separated smaller segment act contain fault extra redundancy built physical connector power supply fan etc
There special software instrumentation package designed detect failure fault masking way ignore fault seamlessly preparing backup component execute something soon instruction sent using sort voting protocol main backup give result flawed output ignored
Software based around nullifying programming error using redundancy static emergency subprogram fill program crash
There many way conduct depending application available hardware
The first known computer built
Its basic design connected via relay voting method detection
Several machine developed along line mostly military use
Eventually separated three distinct category machine would last long time without maintenance one used computer dependable required constant monitoring used monitor control experiment finally computer high amount runtime would heavy use many supercomputer used monitoring
Most development LLNM Long Life No Maintenance computing done NASA preparation research aspect
NASA first machine went second attempt JSTAR computer used
This computer backup memory array use memory recovery method thus called JPL computer
It could detect error fix bring redundant module needed
The computer still working today
computer pioneered mostly manufacturer company USA
These needed computer massive amount uptime would enough fault allow continued operation relying fact computer output would constantly monitored human detect fault
Again IBM developed first computer kind NASA guidance rocket later built
The redundancy
In general early effort design focused mainly internal diagnosis fault would indicate something failing worker could replace
SAPO instance method faulty memory drum would emit noise failure
Later effort showed fully effective system diagnosing isolating fault implementing redundant backup alerting need repair
This known redundancy fault cause automatic fail safe warning operator still common form level one design use today
Voting another initial method discussed multiple redundant backup operating constantly checking result outcome example four component reported answer one component reported answer four would vote fifth component faulty taken service
This called M N majority voting

This approach helpful module development level ready
This method also help determine level software developed make easier report testing progress form percentage
testing approach integrated testing top integrated module tested branch module tested step step end related module
Sandwich testing approach combine top testing bottom testing
One limitation sort testing condition stated specified integration test outside confirmation execution design item generally tested

Big Bang Integration Testing integration testing strategy wherein unit linked resulting complete system
When type testing strategy adopted difficult isolate error found attention paid verifying interface across individual unit
Big Bang Testing represented following workflow diagram Defects present interface component identified late stage component integrated one shot
It difficult isolate defect found
There high probability missing critical defect might pop production environment
It difficult cover case integration testing without missing even single scenario

The question big universe almost old time Where I come I
That may sound like query philosopher crave scientific response try asking cosmologist
This branch physic hard work trying decode nature reality matching mathematical theory bevy evidence
Today cosmologist think universe created billion year ago
The cosmos woven fabric call embroidered cosmic web brilliant galaxy invisible
It sound little strange pile picture experimental data model compiled decade back description
And new information get added picture cosmologist considering even wilder way describe outlandish proposal nevertheless rooted solid science Look standard hologram printed surface see projection image
Decrease size individual dot make image hologram get sharper
In physicist realized something like could happening universe
Classical physic describes fabric structure three dimension space one time
Einstein theory general relativity say basic level fabric smooth continuous
But quantum mechanic leapt onto scene
While relativity great describing universe visible scale quantum physic tell u way thing work level atom subatomic particle
According quantum theory examine fabric close enough made grain information hundred billion time smaller proton
Stanford physicist Nobel prize winner showing happens try combine quantum relativistic description
They found mathematically speaking fabric surface grain act like dot vast cosmic image defining resolution universe
Quantum mechanic also tell u grain experience random jitter might occasionally blur projection thus detectable
Last month physicist Department Energy Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory started collecting data highly sensitive arrangement laser mirror called
This instrument finely tuned pick miniscule motion reveal whether fact grainy smallest scale
The experiment gather data least year may know soon enough living hologram
Just like plot may living highly advanced computer program even know
Some version thinking debated since long Keanu uttered first whoa
Plato wondered world perceive modern mathematician grapple reason math matter look must always equal
Maybe fundamental part way universe coded
In physicist University Washington Seattle said live digital simulation
Standard computer model based grid sometimes grid generates specific anomaly data
If universe vast grid motion distribution particle called cosmic ray may reveal similar glitch give u peek grid structure
A paper MIT engineer Seth build case intriguing spin concept If made quantum bit universe must one
Of course notion raise troubling quandary If universe computer program wrote code
Any Astronomy tell universe burst big bang
But existed point triggered explosion
A Indiana University made case universe forged inside really big
While keep changing mind popular definition black hole region dense past certain point nothing escape gravitational pull
Black hole born dense packet matter collapse death especially hefty star
Some version equation describe black hole go say compressed matter fully collapse instead bounce back spewing hot scrambled matter
Poplawski crunched number found observation shape composition universe match mathematical picture black hole born
The initial collapse would equal big bang everything around u would made cooled rearranged component scrambled matter
Even better theory suggests black hole universe may gateway alternate reality
So test
This model based black hole spin rotation part prevents original matter fully collapsing
Poplawski say able see echo spin inherited parent black hole survey galaxy vast cluster moving slight potentially detectable preferred direction
Another cosmic puzzle come consider happened first sliver second big bang
Maps relic light emitted shortly universe born tell u baby grew exponentially blink eye settling sedate rate expansion
This process called inflation pretty popular among cosmologist got boost year potential still unconfirmed would product rapid growth spurt
If inflation confirmed theorist would argue must live frothy sea multiple universe
Some say big bang contained known false vacuum field devoid matter radiation inherently unstable
To reach stable state vacuum began bubble like pot boiling water
With bubble new universe born giving rise
The trouble testing idea cosmos ridiculously observable universe stretch billion light year even best telescope hope peer surface bubble big
One option look evidence bubble universe colliding another
Today best map big bang relic light show could bruise bumping cosmic neighbor
Or could statistical fluke
So team researcher led Carroll Wainwright University California Santa Cruz running computer model figure bubbly collision would leave big bang echo

The Big Bang Theory leading explanation universe began
At simplest say universe know started small singularity inflated next billion year cosmos know today
Because current instrument allow astronomer peer back universe birth much understand Big Bang Theory come mathematical formula model
Astronomers however see echo expansion phenomenon known
While majority astronomical community accepts theory theorist eternal inflation oscillating universe
The phrase Big Bang Theory popular among astrophysicist decade hit mainstream comedy show name premiered CBS
The show follows home academic life several researcher including astrophysicist
In first second universe began surrounding temperature billion degree Fahrenheit billion Celsius
The cosmos contained vast array fundamental particle neutron electron proton
These decayed combined universe got cooler
This early soup would impossible look light could carry inside
The free electron would caused light photon scatter way sunlight scatter water droplet cloud NASA stated
Over time however free electron met nucleus created neutral atom
This allowed light shine year Big Bang
This early light sometimes called afterglow Big Bang properly known cosmic microwave background CMB
It first predicted Ralph Alpher scientist found accident almost year later
Arno Penzias Robert Wilson Bell Telephone Laboratories Murray Hill New Jersey building radio receiver picking temperature
At first thought anomaly due pigeon dung even cleaning mess anomaly persisted
Simultaneously Princeton University team led Robert Dicke trying find evidence CMB realized Penzias Wilson stumbled upon
The team published paper Astrophysical Journal
The cosmic microwave background observed many mission
One famous mission NASA Cosmic Background Explorer COBE satellite mapped sky
Several mission followed COBE footstep BOOMERanG experiment Balloon Observations Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation Geophysics NASA Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe WMAP European Space Agency Planck satellite
Planck observation first released mapped background unprecedented detail revealed universe older previously thought billion year old rather billion year old
The research observatory mission ongoing new map CMB released periodically
The map give rise new mystery however
The Big Bang Theory say CMB would mostly matter look
Examining CMB also give astronomer clue composition universe
Researchers think cosmos made matter energy sensed conventional instrument
Only percent universe made matter planet star galaxy
While astronomer could see universe beginning also seeking proof rapid inflation
Theory say first second universe born cosmos ballooned faster
That way violate Albert Einstein speed limit since said light maximum anything travel within universe
That apply inflation universe
In astronomer said found evidence CMB concerning sort
The team spotted evidence using Antarctic telescope called Background Imaging Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization
We confident signal seeing real sky lead researcher John Kovac Center Astrophysics told March
But June team said finding could altered galactic dust getting way field view
The basic takeaway changed high confidence result Kovac said
New information Planck make look like prediction dust low added
The result Planck put online form September
By January researcher team working together confirmed Bicep signal mostly stardust
Separately gravitational wave confirmed talking movement collision black hole ten mass larger sun
These wave detected multiple time Laser Interferometer Observatory LIGO since
As LIGO becomes sensitive anticipated discovering black gravitational wave fairly frequent event
The universe expanding
This mean time nobody able spot galaxy Earth vantage point within galaxy
We see distant galaxy moving away u speed increasing time Harvard University astronomer Avi Loeb said March article
So wait long enough eventually distant galaxy reach speed light
What mean even light wo able bridge gap opened galaxy u
There way extraterrestrial galaxy communicate u send signal reach u galaxy moving faster light relative u
Some physicist also suggest universe experience one many
In multiverse model different universe would coexist like bubble lying side side
The theory suggests first big push inflation
This could carved different section different universe potentially different law physic
It hard build model inflation lead multiverse Alan Guth theoretical physicist Massachusetts Institute Technology said news conference March concerning gravitational wave discovery
Guth affiliated study
It impossible I think still certainly research need done
But model inflation lead multiverse evidence inflation pushing u direction taking idea multiverse seriously
While understand universe see came possible Big Bang first inflationary period universe experienced
Some scientist believe live cosmos go regular cycle inflation deflation happen living one phase

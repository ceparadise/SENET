Imagine work vintage candy company
Over year work process grown company prosperous
You find exciting caramel cooker gallon copper kettle World War I still make fantastic candy
However tool use still well
As often happens company growth outpaced computer technology used manage daily operation
So board director decided high time update software hardware bring company century regard speed efficiency
The work breakdown structure developed project manager using project charter scope define going accomplished overall
Every project made work must divided manageable piece building block help u measure progress control outcome project
Work package allow u build success project plan controlling cost resource assigning responsibility managing risk
Utilizing work breakdown structure defined specific work package help keep piece project track
Each work package specific enough allow high level
The work breakdown structure typically used develop separate project schedule
By creating diagram work package project make sure work get done right order completed right time
Building diagram work package help project manager determine step work process mean needed sequence
This important one part process may rely another part process
As example candy company install new software computer technology updated handle additional workload running new software package
Work package design also give project manager information step process meaning depend part project completed
In software project work package creating digital archive document independent work package testing new software manufacturing facility
At outset project project manager must able provide precise cost estimate
Breaking project work package provides specific measure
These cost control measure action team put place make sure money spent project spent appropriately within scope budget project
Executives often use style budgeting project planning
By developing work package project manager use method determining cost
After people specific technical process product knowledge qualified determine precise cost estimate work package
For example office manager able give precise estimate hour needed scan archive data needed populate new software regard account payable account receivable historic sale figure
Get FREE access day create account
The project manager assign responsibility accountability outcome work package appropriate person
By dividing work project specific work package progress project monitored quality specification control
While structuring work package defining work must build quality specification check
Testing idea inspecting work outcome critical part controlling cost ensuring success project
When CEO candy company log new system efficient reliable data must available help make future sale decision based historical data
Quality specification control defined work package ensure historical data properly archived format new system read utilize
After purpose new software save money increase profit company
Successfully managing project begin great planning
You build success factor project utilizing work package basic building block
Understanding relationship among work package help build effective budget schedule document
This high level attention detail decrease confusion among work group help increase chance project work track
Measuring controlling work package key successful project outcome

The thing think need


requirement characteristic work package
I think may need take step back figure really need
There considerable variety people define work package
My practice based advice mentor best practice I seen industry Can decomposed without breaking rule

define requirement could theoretically broken define first requirement first requirement single deliverable partial deliverable As I said beginning I sure understand really asking

Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included The concept work package rather difficult understand
But anyone looking take key topic learn
Work package important preparing WBS project
Let u take closer look concept work package understand better
A smallest unit Work Breakdown Structure
When preparing Work Breakdown Structure using deliverable generally broken smaller manageable chunk work
This process deconstruction continues deliverable small enough considered work package
Each package small enough help Project Manager estimate duration cost
These package scheduled cost estimated monitored controlled
With work package development Work Breakdown Structures becomes easier project manager finer level control assignment
Other benefit include Work package allow team member clear understanding role responsibility organization chart aid
Various format exist document team member role responsibility
Most format fall three type hierarchical
For instance responsibility assignment matrix RAM matrix based chart used illustrate relationship work package activity project team member
On larger project higher level RAM used define project team group unit responsible within work package
Also lower level RAM used within group designate role responsibility level authority specific activity
The work breakdown structure critical input identifying risk facilitates understanding potential risk micro macro level
Risks identified subsequently tracked level work package
When breaking WBS level work package WBS node could decomposed ridiculously low level wasting time actually making project difficult understand manage change
There many thing considered deciding far decompose WBS best create work package important factor consider
Work Packages small enough estimated time cost

The project manager project team satisfied current level detail work package level provides enough information proceed subsequent activity

Work package small enough assigned single person group held accountable result

Although may differ project project project manager concur rule applied measure work package
This rule say work package le hour greater hour

Work package lie different level WBS hierarchy
Project manager artificially force WBS structure work package lie level WBS hierarchy
This result problem project progress like forced detail could monitored controlled specific part work higher enough scrutiny really need

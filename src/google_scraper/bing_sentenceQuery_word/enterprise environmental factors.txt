Former Chief Information Officer CIO Vivek Kundra February paper Federal Cloud Computing state Cloud computing describes broad movement treat IT service commodity ability dynamically increase decrease capacity match usage need
By leveraging shared infrastructure economy scale cloud computing present federal leadership compelling business model
It allows user control computing service access sharing investment underlying IT resource among consumer
When computing resource provided another organization network cloud computing similar electric power utility
The provider benefit economy scale turn enables lower individual usage cost centralize infrastructure cost
Users pay consume increase decrease usage leverage shared underlying resource
With cloud computing approach cloud customer spend le time managing complex IT resource time investing core mission work
Despite endorsement IT management associated shift toward common shared resource large concern many sponsor
MITRE system engineer SEs increasingly supporting sponsor process procuring new IT system migrating existing system common shared infrastructure upgrading internal business system
Although aspect shift technical recognizing many nontechnical system engineering skill need expand address aspect governance increased complexity sharing resource across organization data ownership service management life cycle
In addition center shift data information need share appropriately
Data life blood flow among system database process people carry ability make organization smarter effective
The migration toward shared IT resource need accommodate intended business operation supported well data usage including appropriate access control protection
MITRE SEs expected understand system engineering principle applied IT program support
They also expected understand larger enterprise context program operate
For particular program MITRE may asked play role helping sponsor define refine business process technical system engineering aspect portfolio management operational construct shared infrastructure
For MITRE staff role often involves recommending apply engineering analysis advice process resource achieve desired outcome
Understanding interconnection dynamic across different level organization governance structure important providing thoughtful balanced recommendation
effort require many skill
MITRE SEs may expected support enterprise architecture technical evolution preliminary design data center infrastructure component implementation monitoring operation infrastructure technical governance
Critical area focus normally include information assurance data strategy interoperability application integration information exchange network communication service voice video data
MITRE SEs may assist sponsor initiative application migration infrastructure upgrade consolidation computing infrastructure
Other skill involve quantifying performance across enterprise resource enabling service level agreement
In case deep focused technical knowledge required MITRE SEs must able identify need bring required skill match challenge hand
In complex environment IT program three important factor taken consideration stakeholder technology mission IT support
Failure even one factor cause total program failure
An enterprise usually involves set constituent various goal requirement resource
Sometimes constituent consideration odds one another
Vital element nontechnical aspect enterprise IT understanding various stakeholder able articulate need perspective
Several method exist analyzing stakeholder
For instance simple POET Political Operational Economic Technical analysis used clearly articulate issue associated stakeholder see article
Understanding kind governance required make enterprise function also necessary see article
Governance enables stakeholder communicate need participate enterprise definition evolution operation
The need strong governance overstated
A wide array technology associated enterprise IT program networking detail cloud computing data center
Keeping abreast current trend appropriate area IT program allows address disruptive technology concern apply sound technical practice job
Because computing prevalent today society take many form desktop PCs handheld mobile device everyone touch technology expectation unrealistic
Our sponsor program stakeholder different
The key managing technical expectation knowing technology applicability trust sponsor help recognize something immature implementation bargain
In addition knowing technology knowing apply good IT management technique
IT service effort framework best practice leverage
A fairly complete commonly referenced framework Information Technology Service Management Information Technology Infrastructure Library ITIL owned licensed AXELOS since July

Yip McKern argue Chinese firm evolved three phase innovation capability matured many world standard
They strong competitor China market increasingly foreign market establishing local operation
China well Asian nation see science technology vital achieving economic political goal well national prestige
Lacking indigenous technological innovation seen key national problem
Premier stated Without independent innovation China would unable claim equal place world achieve national honor
Despite Chinese state also case several Asian nation continues heavily direct public private economy research mean national plan regulation tax subsidy
Developing prioritized industry research protected guided
There systemic effort replace foreign technology intellectual property indigenous
Foreign company given many incentive technology transfer moving R D China
At time technological ability indigenous company supported various way
The importance nationalistic governance compared importance factor rapid progress Chinese S T uncertain
There potential conflict opposing foreign nationalistic policy problem foreign company nation blamed Chinese economic scientific advance Chinese nationalistic policy
nationalistic achievement seen becoming main ideological justification societal glue regime loses influence
Some science technology seen questionable trophy project done propaganda purpose Chinese medium filled report Chinese achievement
Between Gross Domestic Expenditures Research Development GERD rose average annually increased share GERD
China aim increase reached

China national R D program include The major national program receive government R D spending
They fund research stated competitive proposal procedure university institute enterprise
Important project may receive funding several program
The program argued large effect also involved scandal corruption fraud accused producing derivative work innovation claimed ignore merit selecting project favor
China trying improve efficiency measure evaluation
Based success China created
They purpose building industry attracting foreign investment increasing export improve regional economy
They considered successful expanded initial fourteen
In first participation Chinese student international student assessment test student ranked first three category mathematics science reading
The Chinese student scored particularly well compared nation mathematics
One explanation Chinese result may culture emphasizing education competitive examination time spent studying part due le participation activity sport
Teaching become higher status occupation
Also industrialized Shanghai done important educational reform may representative rest China
While evidence cheating technical problem testing Shanghai attracts many immigrant rest China may allowed particularly good student study city student may told test important China image
The director testing said result expected produce astonishment examined accuracy international expert OECD received Shanghai score
He also said result refute commonly held hypothesis China produce rote learning Large fraction student demonstrate ability extrapolate know apply knowledge creatively novel situation
China become world biggest source research development personnel
Between number engineer scientist doubled million
Relative population size still low compared major developed nation like United States Japan gap rapidly closing
The number doctorate award science engineering increased tenfold since early
The number student general university increased million million period
In alone China produced engineering graduate many graduate engineering mathematics information technology computer science country
The pitched China alliance nine elite Chinese university receive high amount national research funding produce large share national research output
Chinese university contribute unusually large share patent
The university receive half R D money private enterprise
Eight nine member engineering degree
million student studied abroad since
studying abroad increase previous year
In total returned China occurring particular recent year
returned China increase previous year
China offer several benefit foreign educated Chinese return China
Students also returning increased job opportunity unlike previously many stayed abroad due lack job China
A study found Chinese student plan stay United States due visa restriction fear lack job opportunity belief US growth lag behind average world growth rate
believed best job opportunity China marked contrast earlier survey

Chinese researcher held leading post international organization expert committee held executive higher level position
In early foreign company began transferring technology licensing agreement sale equipment
Later many started transferring technology entering Chinese company order expand China
China introduced increasingly sophisticated regulation access Chinese market traded technology transfer
The entry China required practice stop critic argue continues
Chinese critic argued technology transfer may useful catching create new cutting edge technology
China increasingly encouraged multinational corporation create R D center China
Chinese critic argued foreign owned R D mainly benefit foreign company remove many talented Chinese researcher indigenous company institution
Chinese supporter argued foreign R D serf role model encouragement indigenous company creates skilled community labor knowledge easily flow indigenous company
In R D center corporation created R D center
Corporations argued necessity order adapt product local requirement Chinese market well essential maintaining global competitiveness make use many available Chinese engineer scientist
China ranked first multinational corporation asked nation future R D center likely located
A report found serious shortcoming China national innovation system
There problem service help turn S T work result allocation national funding support S T far optimal
Sometimes researcher became get close market
Another serious problem company facing severe competition looked first purchase foreign technology rather investing developing technology technology development capacity home China
Many patent application came enterprise since small enterprise invest little research
China hierarchical society authority greatly respected feared argued stifle creative debate
China report outlined policy improving innovation
They include large megaprojects area nanotechnology generic microchip aircraft biotechnology new drug
This combined approach model consisting small cooperation industry university
It also argued China world leader making small innovative improvement existing design
One example continual improvement design making gradually smaller le expensive energy efficient
This may create completely new product create headline may important creating employment
A paper found Chinese economy becoming increasingly innovative
The study found rising labor cost China expanded market opportunity world economy main driver behind innovation
The study also found firm innovated le private firm even though firm received far greater subsidy
The central Chinese government large buyer product proposed controversial policy demanding company selling promote Chinese innovation product sold free foreign intellectual property
The controversial part later withdrawn local Chinese government continue use procurement encourage indigenous innovation
Effective protection seen weak
There increasing recognition discourages indigenous innovation effort made strengthen system
China accused protecting foreign intellectual property tacitly allowing technology copied claimed Chinese intellectual property
China became nation highest amount filled application
However reflects part government give company incentive filing patent application regardless eventually granted
The percentage patent application China filed Chinese company rose le nearly data show Chinese company also become important regarding patent overseas Chinese company place two four regarding number patent application filed individual company
China aim transform economy Made China Designed China contract manufacturing company resulting improved profit margin
The relative proportion granted patent lower China behind Japan United States measuring number granted patent US Japan EU South Korea China together administer world patent
However China granted twice many patent South Korea EU five year ago China granted amount region
To encourage innovation avoid foreign intellectual property China developing indigenous
One example standard
Critics seen costly delaying introduction supporter argue increased technical ability experience increased Chinese competitiveness regarding
implemented China indigenous standard
The report stated share English scientific research paper United States first followed China UK Germany Japan France Canada
The report predicted China would overtake United States time possibly early
China scientific impact measured scientist citing published paper next year smaller although also increasing
An analysis data found China increased share highly cited science article
By China could surpass Germany UK ranked second United States
The share United States declined period
A study Chinese social science study found slow increase
The period saw rapid increase
However China still contributed study mainland China surpassed Hong Kong
Economics business larger share social political communication science psychology
The low share social science compared natural science may reflect common pattern Asian nation Chinese social scientist publish national journal included Index le career incitement regarding publishing international journal state ideology control important social science natural science
In China natural science administered social science administered National Planning Office Philosophy Social Sciences may hinder collaboration
Articles published China related basic medial science clinical research indexed increased average year clinical research article
However still represented worldwide clinical research article worldwide randomized clinical trial
Clinical research education medical student involvement supporting environment medical doctor regarding clinical research shortcoming
Canadian company predicted China would publish many natural science engineering paper United States
In China predicted publish many paper US across field
In China predicted surpass US life social science
There journal scientific field
Almost Chinese science organisation publish journal
The government owns support journal small number privately owned
The system argued contribute many low quality journal article infrequently cited also fraud
The Chinese government put place stricter regulation punished terminated journal aim increase quality control peer evaluation journal well create five ten large publishing group
As part reform oversees journal declaration listed various form misconduct plagiarism fraud well penalty perpetrating written warning blacklisting contacting researcher home institution funding agency public disclosure
It also seen important increasing pressure journal informing editor may know action favoring researcher based personal relation unacceptable
China also plan give substantial financial incentive top journal based factor Chinese international
It questioned effect many poor quality journal return money help researcher fill institutional requirement published paper
Chinese owned variety actor local government governmental agency
They may benefit advantage available smaller innovative firm seen problematic
In state owned enterprise many bidding renewable energy project since worry paying investment several decade could ignore risk cost
The owner may attempt protect enterprise competition regulation otherwise use influence unfair manner may stifle innovative private competitor
Private enterprise surpassed stated owned enterprise period regarding rapidity increase research spending patent application R D laboratory
The number research scientist engineer increased rapidly private enterprise declined state owned enterprise
Concerned corruption Chinese science Chinese scientist including Professor Liu Ming 刘明 book 学术评价制度批判 argue interference government official university bureaucrat make far le effective China could
The time scientist spend cultivating politically influential people lost scientific research
Liu argues command economy mentality measuring everything number combined pervasive political interference result great waste money human talent well considerable corruption Chinese science
A investigation certification enterprise allowing large tax break advantage found enterprise gained questionable circumstance investigation sample found pas requirement
The including highest honor People Republic China science technology order recognize citizen organization made remarkable contribution scientific technological progress promote development science technology
In China manufactured world television mobile phone personal computer LCD monitor
Indigenously made electronic component become important source recent growth

As China greatest world far exceeding country including US addition possessing top powerful supercomputer
China developing capacity manufacture component domestically plan first build
China may also planning create much powerful distributed supercomputing connecting supercomputer center together
period world fastest supercomputer
In June successor took crown predecessor
In China new supercomputer became world powerful supercomputer significantly surpassing capability three fold using chip
This signal China success supercomputing industry also domestic technology
China despite extensive governmental support many problem area innovative new design
This may due factor poorly guided state local government support soon outdated technology geographically scattered effort lacking engineering education poor protection intellectual property
This may change factor new emphasis market mechanism rather direct support concentration effort return Chinese studied abroad increased pressure foreign company transfer technology indigenous Chinese technological standard increased demand indigenous technology local market
The country rapidly progressed semiconductor industry backing largest chip maker developer US billion funding secure China dominance semiconductor technology build semiconductor industry next year
Development advanced machine tool seen priority supported Chinese government
China world leading producer consumer machine tool
A US government report stated US export control advanced five axis machine tool ineffectual due technical capability Chinese manufacturer
China leader technology first country world create large scale transport drone well first produce amphibious drone
Chinese drone company conquered majority civilian drone industry DJI alone dominating global market share
Ehang also created world first drone low altitude capable providing transportation medium distance communication
In region manufacturer problem labor shortage raising wage higher expectation regarding work highly educated young people
This increased demand
As China largest user producer technology well first country world perform
It largest robotics market world plan manufacture least industrial robot annually
China produced one third developed world apparel import share decreasing recent year production moving region like Southeast Asia Eastern Europe
Advisory firm director Lilian Luca stated China becoming world leader
Technological solution initially concentrated achieving massive production increasing emphasis placed environmental safety issue part reflecting greater
China already world leader certain area
China imposed export quota rare earth element mined China citing environmental issue accused wanting force industry using rare earth element move China
Finding rare earth element first argue easiest step
Other step towards manufacturing controlled China Japan previously dominant United States lost producer much fundamental technological ability number scientist engineer area declining dramatically
A study found China share academic paper increased le nearly quarter overtaken United States first position
However China le influential top three journal regarding citation
China increasing share influential journal
China second place regarding received patent
National standard oversight body created
predicted Chinese become world largest producer
The Chinese government aim make China regarding exception raw gas
The Chinese industry increasing R D order create higher value product using advanced technology
Another development increasing focus environmental concern renewable energy technology
There lack arable land water mean new technology increase output
Former President Jiang Zemin therefore called new revolution agricultural science technology
Restrictions regulation concerning introduced proposed widespread public concern
China buying million foreign breeder animal well large amount foreign semen livestock embryo order rapidly improve genetics Chinese livestock
More advanced agricultural method increasing use contributed concern regarding
In accounted global output
twice output capture fishing contributed global aquaculture output
The rapid growth aquaculture part due Chinese research regarding artificial breeding
report predicted China within decade become world leader discovery innovation
Some research seen le controversial China elsewhere research regarding genetic cause intelligence
formerly Beijing Genomics Institute described world largest facility
research le controversial Chinese culture supported Chinese research well China order receive experimental often unproven therapy
In regulatory crackdown instituted may increase ability Chinese industry get approval sale future therapy nation
More generally China aim made progress towards becoming world leader also includes area
China stated including biomanufacturing major priority science technology spending
Biotechnology used enhance economic development well improving nutrition healthcare medicine
The Chinese government expects biotechnology add million job period
predicted China would become world second largest pharmaceutical market largest
The chief executive stated year ago many Chinese life science scientist leave China many returning condition often better West regarding laboratory funding political support industry
caused number scandal well problem drug development authority increased regulation enforcement
A report stated decade earlier China barely presence industry ability rapidly growing
China could well become important Europe
Rapid industrialization accompanied many rising
One part Chinese response involves advanced technology world largest rail network high fuel efficiency requirement vehicle
China rapidly expanding treatment system power plant emission reduction system
Due well future export China building technological ability plan create indigenous industry

also entered partnership order help develop Chinese animation industry
The China Research Institute Film Science Technology developed put commercial use well associated technology
It described competitor laying foundation Chinese film projection technology using indigenous Chinese technology intellectual property
The CAA organizes China scientific program
Polar research China particular growing rapidly China three Antarctic research station one
China developing capability eye future application
China successfully tested June Lop Nur Nuclear Weapon Test Base Malan Xinjiang also known
China became fourth country successfully developed
It dropped Chinese manufactured airburst meter
The bomb device boosted primary pusher
The
It fully functional tested month China made first fission device
China thus produced shortest development known history
China received extensive technical help Soviet Union nuclear program rift Soviet Union China become great Soviet Union ceased assistance China
Thus Number test indeed independent endeavor induced military economic sanction enacted superpower time United States Soviet Union
Nevertheless comparison timespans may instructive
The time first atomic test first hydrogen bomb test month USSR month UK month later France month
China different traditional configuration
As advantage completed without calculation needed supercomputer would consume lot time
To shrink size weapon reflector made parabolic solid fusion fuel located focus
It also known Yu Min Design Design Yu Min made major contribution included solution series fundamental critical theoretical problem nuclear weapon led breakthrough unique hydrogen bomb
The goal China produce thermonuclear device least megaton yield could dropped aircraft carried ballistic missile
Several explosion test thermonuclear weapon design characteristic yield boosting preceded thermonuclear test
The major source national pride
In first Chinese satellite launched
In China become third country independently send human space Yang Liwei spaceflight aboard
In China conducted mission
In launched first step towards around

Experience gained lunar program used future program
China plan launch commercial satellite foreign customer aim capture commercial launch market satellite export market
In China launched total rocket second Russia
The completed world largest
One example new Chinese military technology reportedly contributed quick major change US naval strategy
China developing plan make navigational global
Other new technology include development possibly weapon
Chinese according report almost equal United States area China almost capability decade earlier
Despite increased defense spending China share world import arm rapidly falling part reflecting increased ability indigenous military production
China also developing military capability
governmental R D expenditure may go military research according unofficial estimate
The Chinese defense sector remains almost completely state owned military equipment production reorganized corporate body allowing limited competition defense patent system reformed allow greater reward innovative enterprise individual
The organizational structure shed civilian application time cooperation civilian sector increased state supported civilian research sometimes application
Chinese remains problematic area caused concern highest level China still largely dependent import foreign manufacturer
One possible explanation continued Soviet style fragmentation research production line many isolated unit little contact one another causing problem overall standardization integration quality control
More problem may duplication effort dispersal effort unproductive competition patronage causing problem dishonest reporting problem
High precision jet engine may particularly sensitive accumulated quality problem

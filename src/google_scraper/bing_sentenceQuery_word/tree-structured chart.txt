In structure chart according Wolber used specify design architecture
As design tool aid programmer dividing conquering large software problem recursively breaking problem part small enough understood human brain
The process called
Programmers use structure chart build program manner similar architect us blueprint build house
In design stage chart drawn used way client various software designer communicate
During actual building program implementation chart continually referred
A structure chart depicts A structure chart also used associated element comprise run stream thread
It often developed representation allowable
The representation must describe breakdown lowest manageable level
An accurate complete structure chart key determination configuration item CI visual representation configuration system internal interface among CIs
During configuration control process structure chart used identify CIs associated artifact proposed change may impact
According Wolber structure chart developed starting creating structure place root tree form structure chart
The next step conceptualize main must performed program solve problem
Next programmer focus individually conceptualizes broken even smaller task
Eventually program broken point leaf tree represent simple method coded program statement
In practice see figure first checked Structure Chart developed already

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

A way representing nature graphical form
It named tree structure classic resembles even though chart generally upside compared actual tree root top leaf bottom
A tree structure conceptual appears several form
For discussion tree structure specific field see computer science insofar relates graph theory see also
Other related page listed
The tree element called
The line connecting element called branch
Nodes without child called leaf
Every tree structure member
This member called root
The root starting node
But converse true infinite tree structure may may root node
The name relationship node model family relation
The name parent child largely displaced older father son terminology although term uncle still used node level parent
In example encyclopedia parent science culture child
Art craft sibling child culture parent thus one ancestor
Also encyclopedia root tree ancestor science culture art craft
Finally science art craft leaf ancestor node

The original flow chart referring appropriate sequential programming
Computer science dispensed flowchart taken new level
Nowadays use called case diagram target object oriented programming
These diagram display class object method relate
This still use iterative programming
It expected programmer would kind thing head
When I began computer programming taught use structure chart model process decision flow sequence program
This resembled typical flow chart decision point conditional branch
When I entered real world computer programming I discovered majority programmer use formal flowchart organize program logic
They le head although fact I think internalized process became second nature
Still I believe flow chart useful tool introductory course computer science
Organizational structure chart obviously seem like great idea use explain thing people outside certain field example corporate structure chart department structure chart bring mind fact many company people sort background experience payroll accommodate plan
I think chart great way company get everyone page
One editor review suggestion make change warranted

I fairly trivial problem I want make sure I elegant way possible I like opinion people smarter
I class represents generic tree structure Now I Person class represents employee organization
Each object point superior
Multiple employee bos hence I trying create organization chart tree structure
The top node going object null
That I quickly get LINQ
It next step puzzling bit
There multiple approach seem somewhat sloppy I know must much way fill rest org chart
So right I generic object holding employee various generic tree structure I add child node
It basic proper sequence fill tree
Am I recursively supposed iterate line
I know backtracking involved I getting stumped
I apologize background Computer Science I realize tree structure linked list everything else trivial stuff
But first attempt I want see done properly
I appreciate guidance
So given class defined defined work This assumes may one person bos
If fine run code
The definition I used You could shorten though need modify standard operator available

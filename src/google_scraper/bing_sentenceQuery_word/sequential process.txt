In describing
It member family mathematical theory concurrency known process algebra based via
CSP highly influential design programming language also influenced design programming language
CSP first described paper since evolved substantially
CSP practically applied industry tool concurrent aspect variety different system well secure ecommerce system
The theory CSP also still subject active research including work increase range practical applicability increasing scale system tractably analyzed
The version CSP presented Hoare original paper essentially concurrent programming language rather
It substantially different later version CSP posse mathematically defined semantics unable represent
Programs original CSP written parallel composition fixed number sequential process communicating strictly synchronous
In contrast later version CSP process assigned explicit name source destination message defined specifying name intended sending receiving process
For example process repeatedly receives character process named sends character process named
The parallel composition assigns name process process process executes three process concurrently
Following publication original version CSP Hoare Stephen Brookes developed refined CSP modern process algebraic form
The approach taken developing CSP process algebra influenced work CCS vice versa
The theoretical version CSP initially presented article Brookes Hoare Roscoe later Hoare book published
In September book still reference time according albeit unreliable source due nature sampling
The theory CSP undergone minor change since publication Hoare book
Most change motivated advent automated tool CSP process analysis verification
Roscoe describes newer version CSP
An early important application CSP use specification verification element INMOS complex superscalar pipelined processor designed support multiprocessing
CSP employed verifying correctness processor pipeline Virtual Channel Processor managed communication processor
Industrial application CSP software design usually focused dependable system
For example Bremen Institute Safe Systems modeled fault management system avionics interface consisting line code intended use International Space Station CSP analyzed model confirm design free deadlock livelock
The modeling analysis process able uncover number error would difficult detect using testing alone
Similarly applied CSP modeling analysis development software approximately line code secure Certification Authority verify design secure free deadlock
Praxis claim system much lower defect rate comparable system
Since CSP modeling analyzing system incorporate complex message exchange also applied verification communication security protocol
A prominent example sort application Lowe use CSP discover previously unknown attack develop corrected protocol able defeat attack
As name suggests CSP allows description system term component process operate independently interact solely communication
However part CSP name something misnomer since modern CSP allows component process defined sequential process parallel composition primitive process
The relationship different process way process communicates environment described using various operator
Using algebraic approach quite complex process description easily constructed primitive element
CSP provides two class primitive process algebra CSP wide range algebraic operator
The principal one One archetypal CSP example abstract representation chocolate vending machine interaction person wishing buy chocolate
This vending machine might able carry two different event coin choc represent insertion payment delivery chocolate respectively
A machine demand payment offering chocolate written A person might choose use coin card make payment could modelled These two process put parallel interact
The behaviour composite process depends event two component process must synchronise
Thus whereas synchronization required coin would obtain If abstract latter composite process hiding coin card event
get nondeterministic process This process either offer choc event stop stop
In word treat abstraction external view system someone see decision reached person introduced
The syntax CSP defines legal way process event may combined
Let event set event
Then basic CSP defined Note interest brevity syntax presented omits process represents well various operator alphabetized parallel piping indexed choice
CSP imbued several different define syntactically correct CSP expression
The theory CSP includes mutually consistent
The three major denotational model CSP model model model
Semantic mapping process expression three model provide denotational semantics CSP
The defines meaning process expression set sequence event trace process observed perform
For example More formally meaning process trace model defined set possible finite sequence event
The extends trace model refusal set set event process refuse perform
A pair consisting trace refusal set identifies event process may refuse executed trace
The observed behavior process stable failure model described pair
For example The extends failure model handle
The semantics process model pair defined set trace lead divergent behavior
Over year number tool analyzing understanding system described using CSP produced
Early tool implementation used variety syntax CSP making input file written different tool incompatible
However CSP tool standardized dialect CSP devised Bryan Scattergood sometimes referred CSP
The CSP dialect CSP posse formally defined includes embedded
The CSP tool probably commercial product developed Formal Systems Europe often described technically checker convert two CSP process expression LTSs determines whether one process refinement within specified semantic model trace failure
applies various compression algorithm process LTSs order reduce size must explored refinement check
succeeded completely version incorporating amongst thing parallel execution integrated type checker
It released University Oxford also released period
The CSP refinement checker developed Formal Modelling Verification Group
ARC differs internally represents CSP process OBDDs alleviates state explosion problem explicit LTS representation without requiring use compression algorithm used
The project hosted Institut für Informatik Düsseldorf originally created support analysis specification constructed
However also includes support analysis CSP process refinement checking
ProB also used verify property combined CSP B specification
A ProBE CSP Animator integrated
The PAT CSP analysis tool developed School Computing
PAT able perform refinement checking LTL simulation CSP Timed CSP process
The PAT process language extends CSP support mutable shared variable asynchronous message passing variety fairness quantitative time related process construct
The underlying design principle PAT process language combine specification language procedural program
event PAT may sequential program even external C library call greater expressiveness
Mutable shared variable asynchronous channel provide convenient process modelling pattern used standard CSP
The PAT syntax similar identical CSP
The principal difference PAT syntax standard CSP use semicolon terminate process expression inclusion syntactic sugar variable assignment use slightly different syntax internal choice parallel composition
produce animated visualisation CSP system specification support timed CSP
lazy simulator
It model check CSP useful exploring large potentially infinite system
CSP refinement checker interactive modeling analyzing environment
It graphical diagram editor
The user model behavior process CSP expression also diagram
The result checking also reported graphically analyzed interactively peripheral inspecting tool
In addition refinement check It perform deadlock check livelock check
CSP parallel refinement checker
The checking performance linearly scale physical core
Several specification language formalism derived inspired classic untimed CSP including In much concerned concurrent process exchange message broadly similar CSP
However two model make fundamentally different choice regard primitive provide

In mean group element data memory array file accessed predetermined ordered
Sequential access sometimes way accessing data example tape
It may also access method choice example wanted process sequence data element order
However consistent definition sequential access sequentiality
In fact different sequentiality definition lead different sequentiality quantification result
In spatial dimension request size strided distance backward access affect sequentiality
For temporal sequentiality characteristic time threshold impact definition sequentiality
In data structure said sequential access one visit value contains one particular order
The canonical example
Indexing list sequential access requires time index
As result many algorithm degenerate bad algorithm even le efficient naive alternative algorithm impractical without
On hand algorithm typically index require sequential access face penalty

January By Kato Mivule Parallel programming involves concurrent computation simultaneous execution process thread time
While Sequential programming involves consecutive ordered execution process one another
In word sequential programming process run one another succession fashion parallel computing multiple process execute time
With sequential programming computation modeled problem chronological sequence event
The program case execute process turn wait user input another process executed process return according user input creating series cascading event
In contrast sequential computation parallel programming process might execute concurrently yet thread might communicate exchange signal execution therefore programmer place measure place allow transaction
It type environment think CPU utilization
Certainly parallel computation meant multi processor environment
To avoid impasse Michael Suess article Mutual Exclusion Locks Introduction suggests number way solve problem stalemate implementing Mutual Exclusion prevents multiple thread running concurrently working data time
In simplest term mutual exclusiveness achieved placing lock critical region thus allowing one thread time thread done unlocks door critical region giving access another process access critical region
In case stalemate done away Michael Suess mention number method dealing impasse These method control thread communication execution process critical difference sequential programming parallel programming
However benefit parallel computation way overhead multiple thread get executed concurrently making main difference sequential parallel computation

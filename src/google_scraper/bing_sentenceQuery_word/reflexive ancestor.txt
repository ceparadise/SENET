If two set A B refer Cartesian Product A x B
This mean A B b c A x B
It set pair value first A second B
A relation A B subset A x B
A relation said connect value together way showing relationship
As example let take two set
A B
Because two set say relation A
Now consider relation described greater
We start looking A x B
Now relation R subset
One way work relation look value turn
So look first value
The first value second value relation greater
This true part relation
The true say greater say greater
But get see yes greater value relation
In end find relation subset A x B
We show digraph follows say b related R arrow going b
If related b relation R also say aRb
So case
There number different property relation
Let R subset A x R said reflexive true every possible value A true aRa
This mean everything map onto
On digraph shown fact every node loop attached point back
An example relation type could height Everything height still height thing
The key feature though aRa always true
R said transitive true every possible value b c A aRb true bRc true must case aRc true
An example kind relation smaller
If object smaller b object b smaller c obviously object must smaller object This hard spot digraph basically whenever arrow b arrow b c also arrow R said symmetric relation work backwards
For example two node relation b true aRb relation symmetric must also true bRa
height good example symmetric relation If height b obviously b height true object
On digraph shown fact wherever arrow two node another one going opposite direction
R said antisymmetric true b A aRb bRa must equal ie
relation work reverse two node
An equivalence relation relation reflexive symmetric transitive
To show look three feature show The idea equivalence relation aRb b sense
This usually divide set A seperate part
The idea part contains element equivalent b part aRb
So let assume A set natural number R relation state b equal mod
true true etc
true true etc
The digraph look like So see continued would partition odd number even number
The odd number equivalent relation even number equivalent relation
We say divided two class
We talk class set node equivalent
So case set set
This way see set natural number N consists element partition exactly
N
Similarly say conjunction always equal empty set value also appear
In fact equivalence relation following true A partition set subset make set
For example set partition make set There number operation possible relation set
Let relation A The union described set theory every pair thing either
For example family take union relation mother father get relation parent
The intersection described set theory every pair thing
For example intersection relation mother father empty nobody mother father child
The complement described R basically set pair A x A
For example inverse parent parent The inverse described R every pair backwards
For example relation true R
For example inverse parent child
If consider two relation parent mother define another relation grandmother combining finding value mother b b parent Then grandmother In general two relation A B B C relational composition described relation A C b B
For relation R property P say relation S P closure R S property P R another relation property P R subset R S subset R well
For example let assume P property transitivity
The P closure R transitive closure When P reflexivity known reflexive closure P symmetry known symmetric closure
The P closure constructed adding R minimum number pair b make new relation property For example let u consider relation consisting
The reflexive closure relation consisting
All added minimum pair required make reflexive
All rest left alone
The transitive closure harder find
But consider pair pair turn see way get straight
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
needed
needed already
And
The transitive closure relation
The symmetric closure much easier minimum pair ensure every pair work backwards
In case
We added
Another common type relation set relation share property le equal
Such relation called order relation
The simplest kind order relation called partial order follows A partial order relation R reflexive antisymmetric transitive
A partially ordered set poset additional property
Namely integer x either x le equal le equal x
We say two integer comparable relationship le equal
A partial order relation two element comparable called total order
Given ordering set define maximal minimal element
An element poset A partial order said least element element
An element poset A partial order said greatest element element
A minimal element partial order set A element b b
A maximal element partial order set A element b b
In basic term minimal element one another element smaller maximal element element another element bigger
That say minimal element smallest maximal element biggest two element may comparable partial order
A partial order lot minimal maximal element
In general poset A drawn partial order placing larger element top le large element
Draw minimum number line x le sequence line descending x
This called Hasse Diagram
And basically know relation
I recommend reading page note order relation minimal maximal element partial order stuff make tiny bit sense

Suppose I What fast algorithm constructing complete family tree using information
family forest everyone may related single common ancestor
This homework book
It derived issue I coupling adaptive finite element code blackbox mesh generation software boiled core problem expressed analogy share mathematical structure
Right I O method seems horribly inefficient
Thank help
I implemented Gilles suggestion Matlab tested
Here pseudocode code unit test script
I release public domain
We finite set D person relation x mean x
This relation following property Let given data structure following operation defined We also use data structure node contains person set child
If tree write person root node set child
A set tree
We start empty forest add person one one
At step relationship forest relationship ancestor relation
We define recursive function insert tree forest
forest F tree none element tree related person F
Let x
First check whether x ancestor existing person split set F according property x F
Let C subset F consisting descendant x root tree descendant x element also descendant transitivity F remaining subset
By antisymmetry none person C ancestor x
None element related person C assumption
Let u tree root person x set child root C
By chain assumption x ancestor one tree F
Iterate tree F determine one ancestor x root splitting operation one set guaranteed contain one element
Start empty forest iteratively graft person D grafting person mean grafting tree person root child
From remark algorithm easy prove recursive call graft valid relative node tree inserted inside tree x ancestor tree iff x
graft F performs n ancestor test n number person F one test per root F one test per root descendant new node test performed recursive call applies subset F including root
The complexity operation linear number ancestor test performed
Therefore forest construction algorithm performs n ancestor test n total number person
In fact easy see never performs test twice
The overall complexity therefore O
In worst case possible n test performed
This happens two person related unavoidable case
follows somewhat informal description O algorithm build dag V E expressing ancestor relation subsequently thin family tree
dag node person involved edge shall represent ancestor relationship u v E u ancestor v
let n
step build transitive closure ancestor relation iterating pair candidate adding u v E iff
complexity O
step determine source node dag
source node represent minimal element ancestor relation seen partial order
note exactly source node per connected component since consider ancestor among sex
thus edge ending given node v actually forward edge introduced transitive closure underlying family tree
step actually implemented part step counting incoming edge visited node adding node v indeg v heap deleting node indeg v heap
completion step heap contains node indeg ie
source node
node max inserted deleted heap step contributes O n n
step perform depth first search tha dag starting source node
node visited first time record distance current source node immediate predecessor current dfs root path
node visited current root path length greater recorded node set length immediate predecessor value current dfs path delete recorded edge dag
dfs finished dag reduced family forest
every edge visited max complexity O E
step work dag contain crossing edge
therefore given pair u v V never different path u v equal length
summary O O n n O E O By posting answer agree

Partial order theory widely employed computer science particularly logic formal method programming language static analysis
But partial order theory intertwined field like topology zoo definition concept attached area
Not commonly used computer science
In article I summarized fragment partial order theory commonly used computer science particular home fragment static analysis
Topics covered include preorders equivalence relation total order partial order semilattices lattice bounded lattice complete lattice monotonicity fixed point Kleene fixed point theorem
At end find natural liftings partial order lattice across power set Cartesian product sequence function space
Where applicable formal definition transliterated Haskell
If interested partial order theory static analysis check appendix It comprehensive
The header Haskell code file And ghc extension used A binary relation set X iff relation reflexive transitive
A binary relation R x R x x
A binary relation R R b b R c implies R c
An preorder also symmetric
A binary relation R R b implies b R
An equivalence relation divide set S equivalence class
The element x x The set equivalence class X relation set
Every preorder induces natural equivalence relation A preorder antisymmetric
A set X equipped partial order often described pair X
A binary relation R R b b R implies b
In Haskell define partial order type class A binary relation total transitive antisymmetric
A binary relation R two value b R b b R
Totality implies reflexivity mean every total order also partial order
A poset two element b greatest lower bound denoted b
The greatest lower bound b largest element still le
In lattice greatest lower bound must unique
The greatest lower bound b also called b
The following property A poset two element b least upper bound denoted b
The least upper bound b smallest element still greater
In lattice least upper bound must unique
The least upper bound b also called b
The following property If poset meet semilattice join semilattice poset also
In Haskell lattice partial order meet join defined A lattice L exists maximum element top minimum element bottom set L
For element x lattice must case In Haskell type class bounded lattice defines top bottom A lattice L every possibly infinite subset S L least upper bound sup S greatest lower bound inf S
Every complete lattice L bounded lattice Given posets X Y function f X Y x x implies f x f x
To define continuous function first need define function application across set
Given function f X Y S X f x x S
Alternately f f
In text function application notationally distinguished ordinary function application
Given lattice X Y function f X Y S X implies f sup S sup
function also monotonic
Given function f X X x f x f x
With respect monotonic function f X X complete lattice X divide set X region It useful distinguish least greatest fixed point The following property hold region I recommend proving property short exercise
Given monotonic function f L L lattice L starting point x L set K x The notation mean iterated function composition If x Asc f ascending order chain K x since x x x Asc f
In Haskell infinite list represents Kleene chain starting bottom On lattice Kleene fixed point theorem say Moreover lattice finite height exists natural n lfp f
This fact lead simple algorithm computing fixed point
The function look first element sequence repeat neighbor So least fixed point function look stable point Kleene sequence There several natural liftings posets lattice across foundational discrete data structure flat set power set Cartesian product sum sequence function
Given set S pointed poset contains bottom And pointed poset contains top If S poset order extended pointing lattice In Haskell Given set S lift S L x iff In Haskell Given collection posets naturally lift partial order poset If posets lattice resulting poset lattice default
To make lattice must pointed
Given lattice natural Cartesian product lattice In Haskell Given poset L natural sequence poset As sum sequence must pointed become lattice
That sequence greater lesser sequence sequence different length always incomparable
In Haskell Given set S subset S form lattice inclusion P S
Given partial order X define preordered set P X Why partial order
Consider set natural number natural total order
Under regime yet violates antisymmetry
Of course possible lift preorder partial order equivalence class
Alternatively set canonicalized equivalence class represented single distinguished member
If preorder also partial order possible lift partial order equivalence class preorder
Given preordered set X natural partial order equivalence class poset b iff b b Given lattice Y set X natural lattice lattice X Y In Haskell This post scratch surface order theory leaf even application computer science
The two biggest omission reserved future post ordinal Scott domain theory
The ordinal extend natural number transfinite arithmetic provide powerful structure
That structure powerful mechanism reasoning program termination
Scott domain theory give meaningful interpretation infinitely recursive domain equation arise denotational semantics
If like learn Haskell I recommend And using Haskell I recommend

In ability examine modify structure behavior
The earliest computer programmed native inherently reflective original architecture could programmed defining instruction data using
As programming moved compiled language also many language reflective ability largely disappeared programming language reflection built type system appeared
doctoral dissertation introduced notion computational reflection procedural notion component
Reflection used observing modifying program execution runtime
A program component monitor execution enclosure code modify according desired goal related enclosure
This typically accomplished dynamically assigning program code runtime
In programming language reflection allows class interface field method runtime without knowing name interface field method compile time
It also allows new object method
Reflection used adapt given program different situation dynamically
programming almost always requires additional knowledge framework relational mapping object relevance order take advantage generic code execution
Reflection often used part runtime
Reflection also key strategy
In programming language reflection used override rule
For example reflection make possible change value field marked private library class
A language supporting reflection provides number feature available runtime would otherwise difficult accomplish language
Some feature ability These feature implemented different way
In reflection form natural part everyday programming idiom
When verb method called various variable name verb called object verb called populated give context call
Security typically managed accessing caller stack programmatically Since list method current verb eventually called performing test command invoked original user allows verb protect unauthorised use
Compiled language rely runtime system provide information source code
A compiled executable example record name method block executable providing table correspond underlying method selector method compiled program
In compiled language support runtime creation function runtime environment must include compiler interpreter
Reflection implemented language reflection facility using system define automated change
The following code snippet create invoke
For normal call sequence shown
The following example This example assumes class declared unit called This notable example since Delphi unmanaged fully natively compiled language unlike language support reflection
Its language architecture inherits strongly typed Pascal significant influence SmallTalk
Compare example many dynamic script language like Perl Python PHP language runtime like Java C
The following example The following example therefore also applies The following example The following example The following example implying either framework used The following example The following example The following example The following example The following example

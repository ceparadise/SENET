term used early day difficulty writing useful efficient computer program required time
The software crisis due rapid increase computer power complexity problem could tackled
With increase complexity software many software problem arose existing method insufficient
The term software crisis coined attendee first Germany
Lecture make reference problem The major cause software crisis machine become several order magnitude powerful
To put quite bluntly long machine programming problem weak computer programming became mild problem gigantic computer programming become equally gigantic problem
The cause software crisis linked overall complexity hardware software development process
The crisis manifested several way The main cause improvement computing power outpaced ability programmer effectively utilize capability
Various developed last decade improve
However software project large complicated poorly specified involve unfamiliar aspect still vulnerable large unanticipated problem

Stories statistic
We following continuing conversation among journalist programmer educator education United States whether everyone code
It question come often circle pleased read thoughtful nuanced conversation last week Tasneem Raja interactive editor In one statistic particular caught eye The United States graduated proportionally fewer major
Could really
We live age techology company growing exponential rate case order retain best people
So looked
It true percentage bachelor degree awarded computer science percent total significantly higher percentage percent
But focusing single difference miss far interesting story
Take look chart showing proportion bachelor master degree
Aside looking remarkably like Cisco representation San Francisco iconic Golden Gate Bridge chart clearly show fluctuation interest among undergraduate graduate computer science
The reason fluctuation clear graph couple theory In many elementary middle high school taught computer programming student according Joanna Goode
As associate professor education study University Oregon Goode researched access woman student color computer science
But PC revolution took place introduction prepackaged software Internet changed typical school curriculum programming approach computer literacy course use computer Goode wrote email
That could explain rise degree early would grade school drop student elementary school learned use computer program one
Fluctuations attainment often connected fluctuation job market certain industry
The peak degree came four year introduction IBM heyday Apple II likely led increased interest getting degree
Similarly second wave early came four year development bubble Silicon Valley job IPOs seemed almost ubiquitous
The subsequent decline major followed bursting bubble
In either case data seem indicate midst another rise interest computer science college level
Whether result better education lower grade level increased interest related ubiquity smartphones boom say unclear
Furthermore focus major miss larger point
As Raja argues essay simply teaching kid code goal
Just perhaps teaching kid think like computer called computational She highlight current effort teach computational thinking elementary secondary school particularly girl member minority group remain woefully underrepresented among professional computer programmer
And teaching computational thinking may result degree important contribution make giving people across field ability solve problem like computer scientist speak language computer programming
As Raja note skill everyone access regardless major

I frequently hear programmer born earlier today kid know code
Matt Hellinger gave great talk subject followed article subject
Other outlet opined similarly power today Internet Things John Martellaro proposing revamped iPad could ideal learning environment
There plenty truth pundit say
The often seen modern yet affordable equivalent Apple II term easy access underlying hardware software powerful alternative today closed environment
My experience would suggest way go opening Apple II plugging expansion card booting BASIC writing code I taught fall love computer
The Apple II impact extends beyond personal anecdote influencing career industry generation
The peak degree came four year introduction IBM first personal computer heyday Apple II likely led increased interest getting degree writes Jonah Newman Had I started OS X Windows machine I would know begin peeling away pretty GUI surface getting root machine
But interest computer science developed since paralleling rise ubiquity computer smartphones closed device
The chart tell quite story
That blue line one look like hockey stick show interest computer science freshman University Washington Seattle skyrocketed since compared engineering field
While small data set larger one suggests computer science enrollment upswing
After peak CS major demand declined increasing dropping back recent Even though proportionally fewer graduate may cyclical trend actually beginning reverse say analysis blog post
The job market play large role bubble encouraging higher interest enrollment computer science
The sooner kid opportunity use computer program earlier develop interest career computer science
From Apple II Raspberry Pi many opportunity young programmer experience working hardware software
But platform access one variable complex equation childhood one window develop skill
When I started college computer science major I classmate never written program yet chosen major CS almost two decade later still employed industry
The important thing may give child experience spark curiosity
That quality regardless field pursue lifelong value
Hat tip Ken Gagne Apple II Bits powered Theme

A short time ago I meeting Computer Science faculty sat around voicing opinion important field student learn
The discussion centered around trying define CS question field going
I feeling deja vu basic opinion voiced many time recent year
As I sat listening suddenly occurred underlying psychological problem taken Computer Science field malaise experiencing identity crisis questioning value
Let explain
During discussion one Computer Scientists mentioned talk CS becoming next would finally put CS equal footing field like Physics Chemistry Biology Earth Sciences
What happened asked went lament science usually view CS merely supporting work
Another Computer Scientist suggested CS made mistake thinking field creation software software system
He argued computer programming heart instead suggested CS relabel field focus computational thinking one provides solution computational problem
Each position symptomatic underlying problem instead proud great accomplishment creation Internet powerful interactive computer system changed way people around world work play computer scientist seem stuck doldrums feeling disappointed wishing academic prestige
A suggestion

In serf element two principal operation The order element come stack give rise alternative name
Additionally operation may give access top without modifying stack
The name stack type structure come analogy set physical item stacked top make easy take item top stack getting item deeper stack may require taking multiple item first
Considered abstractly sequential collection push pop operation occur one end structure referred stack
This make possible implement stack pointer top element
A stack may implemented bounded capacity
If stack full contain enough space accept entity pushed stack considered state
The pop operation remove item top stack
Stacks entered computer science literature used term bury unbury mean calling returning subroutine
Subroutines already implemented proposed idea filed patent March Bauer received invention stack principle
The concept developed independently Australian first half
Stacks often described analogy stack plate cafeteria
Clean plate placed top stack pushing already
When plate removed stack one pop become new top
In many implementation stack operation push pop
An example top stack observes element without removing stack
Since done pop push data essential
An underflow condition occur stack top operation stack empty pop
Also implementation often function return whether stack empty
A stack easily implemented either
What identifies data structure stack either case implementation interface user allowed pop push item onto array linked list helper operation
The following demonstrate implementation using
An array used implement bounded stack follows
The first element usually bottom resulting first element pushed onto stack last element popped
The program must keep track size length stack using variable record number item pushed far therefore pointing place array next element inserted assuming index convention
Thus stack effectively implemented structure The operation add element increment index checking overflow Similarly decrement index checking underflow return item previously top one Using possible implement stack grow shrink much needed
The size stack simply size dynamic array efficient implementation stack since adding item removing item end dynamic array requires amortized O time
Another option implementing stack use
A stack pointer head list perhaps counter keep track size list Pushing popping item happens head list overflow possible implementation unless memory exhausted Some language make stack operation push pop available standard type
Some language notably family including designed around stack directly visible manipulated programmer
The following example manipulating stack Lisp interpreter prompt line starting interpreter response expression Several container type operation LIFO semantics additionally template class adapts existing container provide restricted operation
PHP class
Java library contains class specialization
Following example program language using class
A common use stack architecture level mean allocating accessing memory
A typical stack area computer memory fixed origin variable size
Initially size stack zero
A usually form hardware register point recently referenced location stack stack size zero stack pointer point origin stack
The two operation applicable stack There many variation basic principle stack operation
Every stack fixed location memory begin
As data item added stack stack pointer displaced indicate current extent stack expands away origin
Stack pointer may point origin stack limited range address either origin depending direction stack grows however stack pointer cross origin stack
In word origin stack address stack grows downwards towards address stack pointer must never incremented beyond etc
If pop operation stack cause stack pointer move past origin stack occurs
If push operation cause stack pointer increment decrement beyond maximum extent stack occurs
Some environment rely heavily stack may provide additional operation example Stacks often visualized growing bottom like stack
They may also visualized growing left right topmost becomes rightmost even growing top bottom
The important feature bottom stack fixed position
The illustration section example growth visualization top stack bottom since stack top item pushed popped
A move first element third position second first third second
Here two equivalent visualization process A stack usually represented computer block memory cell bottom fixed location stack pointer holding address current top cell stack
The top bottom terminology used irrespective whether stack actually grows towards lower memory address towards higher memory address
Pushing item stack adjusts stack pointer size item either decrementing incrementing depending direction stack grows memory pointing next cell copy new top item stack area
Depending exact implementation end push operation stack pointer may point next unused location stack may point topmost item stack
If stack point current topmost item stack pointer updated new item pushed onto stack point next available location stack updated new item pushed onto stack
Popping stack simply inverse pushing
The topmost item stack removed stack pointer updated opposite order used push operation
Many design including dedicated register use stack pointer dedicated call return push pop instruction implicitly update dedicated register thus increasing density
Some CISC processor like also typically stack pointer well
In contrast CPU design dedicated stack instruction therefore register may used stack pointer needed
The architecture example set register organised stack direct access individual register relative current top also possible
As machine general implicit argument allows small footprint good usage also prevents type optimization possible processor permitting two three operand
A stack structure also make implementation somewhat complex implement although still feasible exemplified modern implementation
example architecture using within another strategy avoid use slow main memory function argument return value
There also number small microprocessor implement stack directly hardware stack directly accessible
Examples line
Many microprocessor used implement programming language level
Stacks also used basis number mainframe mini computer
Such machine called famous
Calculators employing use stack structure hold value
Expressions represented prefix postfix infix notation conversion one form another may accomplished using stack
Many compiler use stack parsing syntax expression program block etc
translating low level code
Most programming language allowing parsed stack based machine
Another important application stack
Consider simple example finding correct path maze
There series point starting point destination
We start one point
To reach final destination several path
Suppose choose random path
After following certain path realise path chosen wrong
So need find way return beginning path
This done use stack
With help stack remember point reached
This done pushing point stack
In case end wrong path pop last point stack thus return last point continue quest find right path
This called backtracking
The prototypical example backtracking algorithm find vertex graph reached specified starting vertex
Other application backtracking involve searching space represent potential solution optimization problem
technique performing backtracking search without exhaustively searching potential solution space
A number meaning define basic operation adding two number printing character taking argument stack placing return value back stack
For example return stack operand stack also graphic state stack dictionary stack
Many also including
Almost way receive parameter return special stack hold information calling nesting order switch context called function restore caller function calling finish
The function follow runtime protocol caller callee save argument return value stack
Stacks important way supporting nested function call
This type stack used implicitly compiler support CALL RETURN statement equivalent manipulated directly programmer
Some programming language use stack store data local procedure
Space local data item allocated stack procedure entered deallocated procedure exit
The typically implemented way
Using stack data procedure call important security implication see programmer must aware order avoid introducing serious security bug program
Several use stack separate usual function call stack programming language principle organize information
These include Some computing environment use stack way may make vulnerable security breach attack
Programmers working environment must take special care avoid pitfall implementation
For example programming language use common stack store data local called procedure linking information allows procedure return caller
This mean program move data stack contains critical return address procedure call
If data moved wrong location stack oversized data item moved stack location large enough contain return information procedure call may corrupted causing program fail
Malicious party may attempt attack take advantage type implementation providing oversized data input program check length input
Such program may copy data entirety location stack may change return address procedure called
An attacker experiment find specific type data provided program return address current procedure reset point area within stack within data provided attacker turn contains instruction carry unauthorized operation
This type attack variation attack extremely frequent source security breach software mainly popular compiler use shared stack data procedure call verify length data item
Frequently programmer write code verify size data item either oversized undersized data item copied stack security breach may occur

In natural unit data used particular design
A word handled unit hardware processor
The number word important characteristic specific processor design
The size word reflected many aspect computer structure operation majority processor usually word sized largest piece data transferred single operation word many architecture
The largest possible size used designate location memory typically hardware word hardware word mean natural word processor opposed definition used
Modern processor including usually word size modern general purpose computer usually use bit
Special purpose digital processor instance may use size many size used historically including bit
The example system earlier word size
Several earliest computer modern well used rather plain typically word size decimal digit early fixed word length
The size word sometimes differ expected due earlier computer
If multiple compatible variation family processor share common architecture instruction set differ word size documentation software may become notationally complex accommodate difference see
Depending computer organized unit may used When computer architecture designed choice word size substantial importance
There design consideration encourage particular size particular us
address consideration point different size different us
However consideration economy design strongly push one size size related multiple fraction submultiples primary size
That preferred size becomes word size architecture
size past one influence unit address resolution choice word size
Before character often stored six bit allowed character alphabet limited upper case
Since efficient time space word size multiple character size word size period usually multiple bit binary machine
A common choice also good size numeric property floating point format
After introduction design used character supported letter standard size character accurately became eight bit
Word size thereafter naturally multiple eight bit bit commonly used
Early machine design included used often termed
In type organization numeric operand fixed length rather end detected character special marking often called encountered
Such machine often used number
This class machine included
Most machine work one unit memory time since instruction datum several unit long instruction take several cycle access memory
These machine often quite slow
For example instruction fetch take cycle read digit instruction reduced cycle cycle instruction need address field
Instruction execution took completely variable number cycle depending size operand
The memory model architecture strongly influenced word size
In particular resolution memory address smallest unit designated address often chosen word
In approach address value differ one designate adjacent memory word
This natural machine deal almost always word unit advantage allowing instruction use minimally sized field contain address permit smaller instruction size larger variety instruction
When byte processing significant part workload usually advantageous use rather word unit address resolution
This allows arbitrary character within character string addressed straightforwardly
A word still addressed address used requires bit alternative
The word size need integer multiple character size organization
This addressing approach used IBM common approach machine designed since
Individual byte accessed machine one two way
Bytes manipulated combination shift mask operation register
Moving single byte one arbitrary location another may require equivalent following Alternatively many machine implement byte operation instruction using special register memory
For example byte pointer contained size byte bit allowing byte accessed bit position byte within word word address data
Instructions could automatically adjust pointer next byte example load deposit store operation
Different amount memory used store data value different degree precision
The commonly used size usually multiple unit address resolution byte word
Converting index item array address item requires operation rather multiplication
In case relationship also avoid use division operation
As result modern computer design word size operand size power two time size byte
As computer design grown complex central importance single word size architecture decreased
Although capable hardware use wider variety size data market force exert pressure maintain extending processor capability
As result might central word size fresh design coexist alternative size original word size backward compatible design
The original word size remains available future design forming basis size family
In designed successor
They used quantity referred quantity
This contrast earlier machine natural unit addressing memory would called quantity one half word would called
In fitting scheme VAX bit
Another example family processor three different word length later released
As software routinely one next documentation define refer older thus shorter full word length CPU software may compiled
Also similar byte used small number many program shorter word bit may used context range wider word needed especially save considerable stack space cache memory space
For example Microsoft maintains definition bit despite fact API may used processor standard word size would bit respectively
Data structure containing different sized word refer byte byte byte respectively
A similar phenomenon developed support various size backward compatibility instruction set instruction mnemonic carry q identifier denoting term architecture original word size
In general new processor must use data word length virtual address width older processor older processor
Often carefully written source code written mind recompiled run variety processor even one different data word length different address width

I currently writing thesis us genetic algorithm point
Now I need define parameter genetic algorithm I know optimal parameter configuration problem
However I need default parameter finding optimal parameter scope paper
Also I want use random value parameter
I would prefer reuse parameter used well trusted source field genetic algorithm
Then I could rely cited source reuse parameter
I need default value parameter I searched paper sure paper
I looking paper parameter used
A online available pdf preferable
As say universal parameter setting mean wo find source cite setting
Instead find paper tune parameter particular problem find many many others simply take standard set parameter setting without much attempt justify
In case like single authoritative source cite like bunch people sort converge parameter seem common everyone
The best really say something like parameter value chosen commonly observed literature
Also depends problem particular structure CHC Eshelman example usually used population size small typical standard conventional mutation operator add piece make
Genetic programming practitioner often use population size thousand use high mutation rate
For standard GA use population size mutation rate length encoding assuming discrete enough generation second one would question thing much
However aside citing random selection paper lot point justification
Also light parameter tuning almost certainly better idea afford
For generation count basic rule go either exhaust amount time allot algorithm converges whichever come first
Of course interdependent
Raising population size raising mutation rate slow convergence still need tune parameter best result
If research purpose least also measure runtime fitness function evaluation rather generation
The reason algorithm find solution N generation almost certainly find better solution N generation multiply population size
You get two order magnitude searching I could comparison unfair
Reporting generation used automatic red flag paper unless GA parameter controlled degree sure comparison apple apple
Measuring evaluation much tightly correlated time measuring generation essentially always preferred
For population size see
For mutation I found reference page The rule thumb selection pressure used associated instance Microbial GA using tournament size optimal mutation rate region one mutation per genotype taking account junk neutral mutation Finally default value number generation deong pointed whatever available time result reasonable solution problem genotype converge optimum however tricky could converging one several local optimum
indicated answer standard parameter unless working model created others attempting mimic
however here another angle
ask specifically key GA parameter
standard obtained GA evolution whether parameter need adjusted
population size population small improvement per iteration fitness function low measured best candidate solution average solution
increase population size fitness function increase faster sign suboptimal
also point increasing population size improve rate increase fitness function
mutation rate low algorithm cover search space much
high good candidate solution perturbed pushed worse solution
basically rough measure rate improvement fitness function
number generation number generation related improvement fitness function
fitness function usually show major improvement early generation asymptotically approach optimum
enough trend determine theoretical optimum line much improvement per time possible
This question reminds whole area called
Where objective find suitable parameter setting particular evolutionary search algorithm specific problem search done another evolutionary process
If problem involve costly function evaluation type could easily implementable
So far I remember ECJ already offer type implementation
The setting inherently dependent nature problem trying solve
However population size could somewhat estimated see detail

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
We professional Scrum Master consultant recently joined project
Unfortunately know name never introduced u came one day said daily seem much else except chair daily stand meeting I asked also give daily feedback meeting quite affronted saying Scrum Master job facilitate participate
This seems fairly worked agile project team self directed supposed egalitarian I sure work Scrum Methodology
I suspect much day reason defensiveness issue
Does Scrum Master take part yesterday today impediment spiel meeting role chair facilitate meeting
We actually told job assume since call Scrum Master Ideally scrum master responsible facilitating project activity address sort impediment faced
participate yesterday today impediment spiel daily per se however answerable team member kind status impediment reported earlier
I worked scrum team reputed organization followed practice
To get detailed picture responsibility scrum master I recommend look I SM many year I defer team
If would like participate I well facilitate
The idea one leader
The team ability SM sweep demand stand without introducing
In give status impediment retrospective give opinion could made meaningful efficient
If one expects SM give status daily activity IMHO one wrong expectation
Purpose status team align activity know team member would want know SM yesterday plan today
At least one even suggest SM even required daily basis
A quote The Scrum Master job Nevertheless IMHO increase transparency join yesterday today impediment procedure
Also IMHO perfect optionally also participate answer three sentence inside Daily Scrum
But official Scrum
I Scrum Teams position Scrum Master use electronic Taskboard agile practice
All team exception one provides status task working moving one person next typical standup process
The exception team decided wanted standup going story story asked I lead one drive meeting
Is Scrum Master take role standup
I understand team resource seems babysitting role designed make everyone pay attention instead team responsible adult want take trouble
One member team also work one team mentioned sprint retro much faster meeting go person step take lead board
It make difference team PO pushed team stand ground method
Your company started wrong
The scrum master part team
By hiring full time scrum master add another layer team holder
Totally Agile
One person team normally manager also part team take role scrum master
But really
role anyone fill needed
In one team used rotate every month
Now answer question
The SM part team take part team
easy
SM menial job following thing externally team
So SM usually take little le work one interrupted time external communication sending email like update ask
nothing
Snake oil salesman saw opportunity selling full time scrum master scum earth go completely Agile noted
Scrum Master give status update facilitate stand meeting
Their role make sure meeting start time everyone meeting give status update within time frame take action roadblock completing task
FYI using daily stand meeting online also allows offshore team participate facilitate meeting process submitted task online
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution
If please discus UALR academic advisor answer question student transfer credit aspect student academic program study

Also I want know feel work big company Microsoft Apple Facebook etc
Student New York New York Karma Questions Enter phone number email send message update question


myEmail phone number email address required
United States America Software Engineer Google There always variation course multiple answer able build picture
I majored Computer Science college working Software Engineer Google
This common path technically different going Computer Science job
That would likely involve lot theoretical work I
On typical day Google I start checking email large part company California three hour later use email lot tends large amount built night I went home figure project start working
Sometimes I program needed run hour execute overnight I base start result reported
The division Google I large complicated program work revolves around
I usually handful different project involving
Right I adding feature customer investigating whether change one source data another one improving testing tool main program make better use Google infrastructure I involved finding place clean code base addition various small task
On given day I pick project based people waiting I get result old test simply I feel like I make progress start working
I actually spend much time writing new code main program I spend lot time examining see work add new piece writing test small change I make
I also write lot smaller program help thing like data analysis making tool others use
I usually work couple project different time day I get stuck one meeting usually happens least day I use boundary spur shift project
I work around hour day though vary slightly depending I making particularly large amount progress something want leave
I let make habit staying longer hour though since engineer degrades quality life
While working I try stay fairly focused though variety way take small mental break quick chat friend online work person work online people work website like Google News
I find I productive I give brief chance rest
So
Get work check email cycle among project mean writing code looking data I go home
I greatly enjoy though everyone
Thank much Eric
Senior Network Engineer Zynga Greetings Eddie
I pleased see variety answer question
Having weathered late worked several tech startup large r company since I happy ofder personal response question
In addition linear often repetitive task outlined thread professional I add variable On Call generally applies computer science type bona fide engineer work within Global Foundation Services GFS also sometimes referred DevEng DevOps SiteOps TechOps ITOps
The vast majority Tech organization operational infrastructure consists team On Call engineer share rotational Duty Roster defines escalation path Whom Shall I Contact Customer Affecting Outage
On Call engineer Network Engineering Site Reliability Engineering SRE typically support one company revenue stream Corporate Production
Production resource router switch firewall virtualized application server cluster database cluster typically reside physically secured datacenter environment
When something break On Call team called immediate service
The longer issue unscheduled website related maintenance example go unresolved revenue lost thoroughly company reputation damaged
As On Call Network Engineer I wear multiple hat often simultaneously I worked long hour straight scenario past however average day hour
proactive versus reactive work
Within dynamic context Internet environment remain long
The constant pace Big Business demand equipment data circuit upgraded seemingly endlessly
If think might enjoy almost academic work mind frequent stress occasional GRUELING hour career Network Engineering Site Operations may prove aspiration
Fiscal compensation reasonably good certainly quite acceptable however type work I perform daily considered utterly unacceptable many value insist upon static unchanging predictable seems popular term de rigueur
I know fewer peer held similar post endured divorce spouse specifically due interruptive unpredictable nature work
Your mileage may vary
I hope help
Good luck
Client Education Manager It truly depends type environment working
With related job around computer science find working ether waterfall agile based senario
Under waterfall I like call waterfail mentality find coding several project much communication client besides beginning end project
If working environment like important developed promised
There room change
The method called Agile
This iterative based mentality work one project time communicate client thoughout project
You still find coding lot interaction client throughout project
Note reflect type work implementing way work delivered
Software Engineer Test Sqrrl I test engineer experience bit different average developer lot procedure I get office around meeting talk yesterday planning today anything blocking u something stopping u moving forward completing task
It short meeting make sure team page
After I check email engineer startup mean inbox usually blissfully empty
I worked Amazon though I sift good amount email every morning
Then I pick whichever project I working day
We try avoid meeting afternoon startup even ca time
At bigger company meeting generally occur throughout day
My project usually consist writing automated test exercise new feature diagnosing test failure reviewing developer code occasionally manual testing release feature set automated testing wo work well
It definitely varies day day boring
I like say I get paid break people stuff actually fairly accurate
I generally office hour day typical startup ideal promote healthy balance work rest life
I sometimes office crunch time say working make deadline time rare perk make
Software developer general spoiled rotten
So summarise get sync team check email work project write code read code test code look data go home around pm

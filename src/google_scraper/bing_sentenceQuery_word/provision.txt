Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example

Yes No
It depends obviously For CBSE candidate till std completely diff ball game
Honestly I find tough I also find scoring best part get show programming skill board
I purposely used word show almost every one seen THE SOCIAL NETWORK
P But interest engineering taken CBSE I would preferably consider something scoring computer science requires attention regular involvement may hinder competition preparation
PS There lot mug still interesting
I honestly know Delhi student score tremendous mark subject get hear mark much Maharashtra
BEST OF LUCK






Thanks Computer Science certainly subject Senior Secondary level
If interested Computer would certainly want take
By taking CS learn basic programming help future especially pursue CS
But remember one thing subject master week
Understanding concept important factor
Treat like Maths
And practice programming PC give boost
also scoring subject easily get hour study daily
Plus give power create scaled project apps young age prove Beneficial
Long story short Hard easy depends interest level love subject amount time involve
people hate mathematics make mathematics hard subject
Frankly speaking I knowledge programming class
Since I like biology interest medical I opted computer science
What mistake I I focused science subject computer appeared hard initially
So repeat mistake spend considerable amount time learning subject depth
Topics like pointer take time understand appear easy
Although CBSE syllabus vast order excel subject need concept clear
Practice programming regular basic strong hold subject also help locate error easily conclude output common question subject
You easily score well concept clear
I assure clear idea subject interesting subject list

I adept computer already mentioned still managed score board reason pursuing CSE

A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack
act masquerading valid entity falsification data username order gain access information resource one otherwise unauthorized obtain
There several type spoofing including describes malicious modification product
security service planting surveillance capability router example

For example standard computer user may able fool system giving access restricted data even full unrestricted access system
attempt acquire sensitive information usernames password credit card detail directly user
Phishing typically carried often directs user enter detail fake website whose look feel almost identical legitimate one
Preying victim trust phishing classified form
also known UI redress attack User Interface redress attack malicious technique attacker trick user clicking button link another webpage user intended click top level page
This done using multiple transparent opaque layer
The attacker basically click meant top level page routing irrelevant page likely owned someone else
A similar technique used hijack keystroke
Carefully drafting combination stylesheets iframes button text box user led believing typing password information authentic webpage channeled invisible frame controlled attacker

It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking

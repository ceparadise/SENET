A arrangement row column possibly complex structure
Tables widely used
Tables appear print medium handwritten note computer software architectural ornamentation traffic sign many place
The precise convention terminology describing table vary depending context
Further table differ significantly variety structure flexibility notation representation use
In book technical article table typically presented apart main text numbered captioned
A table consists ordered arrangement
This simplified description basic kind table
Certain consideration follow simplified description The element table may grouped segmented arranged many different way even nested
Additionally table may include header ancillary feature
The following illustrates simple table three column seven row
The first row counted used display column name
This called header row
The concept also part basic terminology
Any simple table represented table data value ordered
A common example table
In table cell body table value cell relates value beginning column
header row structure complex table
This combination value header row row lack better term header column column lack better term related unique cell table Tables described wide narrow format
As communication tool table allows form information unlimited number different social scientific context
It provides familiar way convey information might otherwise obvious readily understood
For example following diagram two alternate representation information presented side side
On left NFPA standard example value indicated right simple table displaying value along additional information
Both representation convey essentially information tabular representation arguably comprehensible someone familiar NFPA standard
The tabular representation may however ideal every circumstance example space limitation safety reason
There several specific situation table routinely used matter custom formal convention
Modern software application give user ability generate format edit table tabular data wide variety us example Tables us software development specification implementation
Usage software specification encompass ad hoc inclusion simple textual document use tabular specification methodology example include SCR Statestep
Proponents tabular technique among prominent emphasize understandability well quality cost advantage format allowing systematic inspection corresponding shortcoming experienced graphical notation cited motivating development least two tabular approach
At programming level software may implemented using construct generally represented understood tabular whether store data perhaps earlier result example determining flow program execution response various event input
Database system often store data structure called table column data field row represent data record
In medieval covered piece cloth count money
archaic term English institution accounted money owed

We know Government promoting Small Family Norms order control population
As per present norm family consists Two child said small family
As Central Government Employees entitled certain concession maintaining small family norm
Government also restricting certain Concessions allowance reimbursement Central Government Employees two child
The concession Allowances reimbursement Leave Travel Concession Children Education Allowance Child Care Leave etc would fall category
Let u look Concessions incentive applicable Central Government Employees undergoing Sterilization Operation order maintain small family norm

Having one surviving Child prior undergoing Family planning procedure Sterilization Operation must avail concession

As far condition based age employee concerned following table give necessary detail

Similarly prior family planning procedure employee two child

When Family planning procedure successful Government Employee spouse getting pregnant due failure Sterilization operation government employee entitled incentive date pregnancy

A Certificate prescribed form given hospital authority performing family planning procedure sterilization operation effect Family Planning procedure completed respect employee spouse

In case Family Planning procedure done private hospital civil surgeon DMO AMA Medical Officer CGHS counter sign form signed certified private hospital effect Family Planning procedure completed respect employee spouse

Either government employee spouse undergo Sterilization operation order maintain small family norm

In case birth twin child giving birth one surviving Child concession Small Family Norms granted employee would allowed said employee spouse undergoing sterilization operation since giving birth twin baby second birth beyond control employee maintain small family norm
Normally recovery concession availed would ordered case failure Sterilization operation
However concession small family norm provided employee spouse undergoing family planning procedure subject fulfillment condition small family norm

In respect rebate HBA Government allows rebate even employee undergoing Family planning procedure sterilization operation receipt first installment HBA receipt final installment HBA
My wife undergone family planning operation I joined KVS
Am I eligible con allowance yes fpa tgt grade pay Required field marked

To avoid problem voltage stability loss security power system needed monitor frequently problem controlled using Flexible AC Transmission System FACTS device
They help improve voltage profile security system minimize transmission line loss
Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor TCSC one FACTS device easier control control device

Schools offering
SQL look data set table
Queries generated database manager define relationship data element table
Executing query allows database manager retrieve data database fit desired criterion
Query syntax similar natural English making SQL easy programming language learn
The nuance SQL variant may difficult
SQL divided Data Definition Language DDL Data Manipulation Language DML
DDL allows database manager create database
DML part SQL work data
Transaction control advanced component SQL used every SQL application
Transactions refine DML action
Most database program different graphical user interface SQL variant
SQL first developed IBM title SEQUEL
In American National Standards Institute began standardize SQL creating ANSI SQL
Software company developer use modification SQL based industry standard ANSI SQL

The commonly abbreviated statistical tool used designed analyze represent involved completing given
First developed commonly used conjunction
Project Evaluation Review Techniques commonly abbreviated PERT
PERT method analyzing task involved completing given project especially time needed complete task identify minimum time needed complete total project
It incorporates uncertainty making possible schedule project knowing precisely detail activity
It technique rather used project time major factor rather cost
It applied complex infrastructure Research Development project
Program Evaluation Review Technique PERT offer management tool relies arrow node diagram arrow represent work necessary reach node indicate completed phase total project
PERT CPM complementary tool CPM employ one time estimate one cost estimate activity PERT may utilize three time estimate optimistic expected pessimistic cost activity
Although distinct difference term PERT applied increasingly critical path scheduling
PERT developed primarily simplify planning scheduling large complex project
It developed support Navy Polaris nuclear submarine project
It found application industry
An early example used applied PERT opening Games
This project model first kind revival founded Frederick Taylor later refined Henry Ford
invented roughly time PERT
Initially PERT stood already renamed
It made public two publication Department Navy entitled In article main Head Program Evaluation Branch Special Projects Office Navy gave detailed description main concept PERT
He explained Through electronic computer PERT technique process data representing major finite accomplishment event essential achieve event time range time necessary complete activity two successive event
Such time expectation include estimate likely time optimistic time pessimistic time activity
The technique management control tool size outlook meeting objective time highlight danger signal requiring management decision reveals defines methodicalness slack flow plan network sequential activity must performed meet objective compare current expectation completion date computes probability meeting scheduled date simulates effect option decision decision
The concept PERT developed operation research team staffed representative Operations Research Department Evaluation Office Program Evaluation Branch Special Projects Office Department Navy
Ten year introduction PERT American Maribeth Brennan published selected publication PERT CPM published
The origin development summarized follows PERT originated design construction scheduling
Since time used extensively also many situation management desire achieve objective complete task within scheduled time cost expenditure came popularity algorithm calculating maximum value path conceived
PERT CPM may calculated manually computer usually require major computer support detailed project
A number college university offer instructional course
For subdivision work unit PERT another tool developed
The Work Breakdown Structure provides framework complete networking Work Breakdown Structure formally introduced first item analysis carrying basic
In PERT diagram main building block connection known predecessor event successor event
Besides event PERT also know activity PERT defined four type time required accomplish activity PERT supply number tool management determination concept The first step scheduling project determine task project requires order must completed
The order may easy record task building house land must graded foundation laid difficult others two area need graded enough bulldozer one
Additionally time estimate usually reflect normal time
Many time time required execute task reduced additional cost reduction quality
In following example seven task labeled
Some task done concurrently others done predecessor task complete begin complete
Additionally task three time estimate optimistic time estimate likely normal time estimate pessimistic time estimate
The expected time computed using formula
Once step complete one draw network diagram
A network diagram created hand using diagram software
There two type network diagram activity arrow activity node
Activity node diagram generally easier create interpret
To create AON diagram recommended required start node named
This activity duration zero
Then draw activity predecessor activity example connect arrow start node
Next since list predecessor activity node drawn arrow coming
Activity listed predecessor activity node drawn arrow coming signifying begin completed
Activity predecessor activity arrow drawn connecting activity
Likewise arrow drawn
Since activity come recommended required connect node labeled
By network diagram pictured give much information Gantt chart however expanded display information
The common information shown In order determine information assumed activity normal duration time given
The first step determine ES EF
The ES defined maximum EF predecessor activity unless activity question first activity ES zero
The EF ES plus task duration EF ES duration
Barring project take work day complete
The next step determine late start LS late finish LF activity
This eventually show activity
The LF defined minimum LS successor activity unless activity last activity LF equal EF
The LS LF minus task duration LS LF duration
The next step determine activity
The critical path path take complete
To determine path time add task duration available path
Activities slack delayed without changing overall time project
Slack computed one two way slack LF EF slack LS ES
Activities critical path slack zero
The critical path critical time work day
It important note one critical path project complex example critical path change
For example let say activity take pessimistic b time complete instead expected T time
The critical path critical time work day
On hand activity reduced one work day path time reduced work day slightly le time new critical path work day
Assuming scenario happen slack activity determined
Therefore activity delayed almost work day without delaying project
Likewise activity activity delayed work day without delaying project alternatively delayed work day
During project execution however project never execute exactly planned due uncertainty
This due ambiguity resulting subjective estimate prone human error result variability arising unexpected event risk
The main reason PERT may provide inaccurate information project completion time due schedule uncertainty
This inaccuracy may large enough render estimate helpful
One possible method maximize solution robustness include safety baseline schedule order absorb anticipated disruption
This called
A pure proactive scheduling utopia incorporating safety baseline schedule allows every possible disruption would lead baseline schedule large
A second approach termed consists defining procedure react disruption absorbed baseline schedule

A PERT chart project management tool used schedule organize coordinate task within project
PERT stand methodology developed Navy manage Polaris submarine missile program
A similar methodology CPM developed project management private sector time

A PERT chart present graphic illustration project network diagram consisting numbered either circle rectangle representing event milestone project linked labelled directional line representing task project
The direction arrow line indicates sequence task
In diagram example task node must completed sequence
These called task
The task node node dependent completion one start undertaken simultaneously
These task called task
Tasks must completed sequence require resource completion time considered
These represented dotted line arrow called
For example dashed arrow linking node indicates system file must converted user test take place resource time required prepare user test writing user manual user training another path

Program Evaluation Review Technique PERT Used project activity extent governed organization full control activity duration hence time estimate activity probabilistic
For example R D project project exposed seasonal variation
In PERT use three time estimate activity reflect degree uncertainty Optimistic time When environment favorable tm Most likely time When environment normal tp Pessimistic time When environment unfavorable There number time estimate tp The frequency distribution curve activity time assumed distribution unimodal tm extreme tp
But tm need mid point tp
There possibility alternate Critical path
In case need consider critical path greater variance
As analysis based probabilistic time estimate even near Critical path carefully examined
When activity time tj independent identically distributed random variable Central limit theorem project duration T follow normal distribution Problem
Given list activity project time estimate day Draw project network b Determine critical path expected project duration c What probability project completed day
What due date chance met

The Program Evaluation Review Technique PERT widely used method planning coordinating project
As Harold Kerzner explained book PERT basically management planning control tool
It considered road map particular program project major element event completely identified together corresponding
PERT chart often constructed back front many project end date fixed contractor flexibility
A basic element planning identify critical activity others depend
The technique often referred CPM standing critical path method
PERT developed effort Navy contractor working Polaris missile project
Concerned growing nuclear arsenal Soviet Union government wanted complete Polaris project quickly possible
The Navy used PERT coordinate effort contractor involved project
Experts credited PERT shortening project duration two year
Since government contractor required use PERT similar project analysis technique major government contract
The chief feature PERT analysis network diagram provides visual depiction major project activity sequence must completed
Activities defined distinct step toward completion project consume either time resource
The network diagram consists arrow node organized using one two different convention
The arrow represent activity convention node represent activity convention
For activity manager provide estimate time required complete
The sequence activity leading starting point diagram finishing point diagram called path
The amount time required complete work involved path figured adding estimated time activity along path
The path longest total time called critical path hence term CPM
The critical path important part diagram manager determines completion date project
Delays completing activity along critical path necessitate extension final deadline project
If manager hope shorten time required complete project must focus finding way reduce time involved activity along critical path
The time estimate manager provide various activity comprising project involve different degree certainty
When time estimate made high degree certainty called deterministic estimate
When subject variation called probabilistic estimate
In using probabilistic approach manager provide three estimate activity optimistic best case estimate pessimistic worst case estimate likely estimate
Statistical method used describe extent variability estimate thus degree uncertainty time provided activity
Computing standard deviation path provides probabilistic estimate time required complete overall project
Managers obtain great deal information analyzing network diagram project
For example network diagram show sequence activity involved project
From sequence manager determine activity must take place others begin occur independently one another
Managers also gain valuable insight examining path critical path
Since path require le time complete often accommodate slippage without affecting project completion time
The difference length given path length critical path known slack
Knowing slack located help manager allocate scarce resource direct effort control activity
For complex problem involving hundred activity computer used create analyze project network
The project information input computer includes earliest start time activity earliest finish time activity latest start time activity latest finish time activity without delaying project completion
From value computer algorithm determine expected project duration activity located critical path
Managers use information determine project time shortened injecting additional resource like worker equipment
Needless say solution algorithm easy computer resulting information good estimate originally made
Thus PERT depends good estimate sometimes inspired guess
PERT offer number advantage manager
For example force organize quantify project information provides graphic display project
It also help identify activity critical project completion time watched closely activity involve slack time delayed without affecting project completion time
The chief disadvantage PERT lie nature reality
Complex system plan many supplier channel supply involved sometimes make difficult predict precisely happen
The technique work best engineering project sufficient experience exists predict task accurately advance

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In representation entity manipulated program
The member value type
The value variable given corresponding
In language becomes necessary distinguish content location variable
In language value
This mean resulting value independent location expression needed compute value stored
Only content location bit whether interpretation significant
Some language use idea deriving typical mode evaluation left right hand side assignment statement
An lvalue refers object persists beyond single expression
An rvalue temporary value persist beyond expression us
The notion introduced CPL
The notion expression analogous mode input parameter value assigned parameter value assigned though technical detail differ context language
In many language notably programmatically accessible running program via operator like meaning variable dereferenced reference certain memory location
see term used distinguish
Consider C expression
When executed computer generates integer value program explicitly designated computer stored expression non
On hand C program declares variable x assigns value x expression value
In C term originally meant something could assigned hence name indicating left side assignment operator since reserved word constant added language term
In special exists denote compiler address retrieved using operator program see
This type reference applied including well
Some processor provide one instruction take sometimes referred immediate short
An immediate value stored part instruction employ usually load add subtract register
The part instruction destination
The latter may implicit
A value may reside register stored elsewhere memory requiring instruction contain direct indirect address index register address value
The expression designates refers object
A addressable assignable
A modifiable allows designated object changed well examined
An expression expression

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

The report may returned student employer retained Faculty discretion Coordinator
The objective report help Excessive number spelling typographic grammatical error ground rejection report
All student presumed able write report clear proper English lack proficiency acceptable excuse badly written report
You must discus issue potential confidentiality supervisor well start writing report
Employers want publicly reveal information expose company trade secret make company look bad expose company potential lawsuit give useful information competitor
You must make every effort avoid report employer willing let faculty member read
This two reason We want learn want ensure treated way student
You explain employer document made officially way b marking done faculty member within Faculty Computer Science
Nevertheless might enough satisfy employer
Even bulk work highly confidential normally discus issue
Another approach often possible carefully mask confidential information changing name omitting key detail etc
If mask information say either report letter transmittal
Undergraduate student submit reflective style report first second work term

Most common type report written employer fail meet guideline generally focus result product student role work Reports edited company staff acceptable unless reviewed solely confidentiality reason
If report written employer meet criterion may still able take report stand enhance meet criterion creating new document based original
If say letter transmittal
For example written long document many technical detail cut technical detail enhance analytical component well explain role work
Finally work term report permanent record work well done serf faculty student potential employer example ability
Your report mention work asked perform introduction reader clearly understand entire work term duty concentrate one topic coherent depth discussion topic rather superficial report many thing
The introduction explain key idea discussing body report provided detailed discussion
The conclusion summarize said
The entire report written audience student program manager professor might read report later
Anything know study point needed understand report explained report
It important information presented report valid reason
Do add additional material report required length instead expand discussion meet length requirement choose another topic entire report
This applies also appendix add appendix serve justify point made body report
For example include large amount source code feel source code truly necessary illustrate point making provide sample maximum line normally put appendix
Your report must contain least page text point Times New Roman font similar using standard report format
The main body report must least word
You also addition include figure table appendix necessary
The total length report exceed page word
Normal report equivalent page word
Figures table program listing quoted material like count report length
You must pay careful attention explain information report come
This mean must give full reference idea talk quotation
Remember referencing material improperly expose charge plagiarism
This serious academic offence result failed report possibly University sanction see UNB Calendar detail If work term involves unusual circumstance therefore unsure whether report meet requirement contact Coordinator
You since Coordinator large number student deal record discussion important case problem later
Before contacting Coordinator please sure guideline ensure question answered

This question already answer Specifically I seen used context text filtering
As predicate filter criterion
Is accurate
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
It term commonly used field Mathematical Logic
From In mathematics predicate either amount characteristic function indicator function relation
A function P true false called predicate X
When P predicate X sometimes say P property
predicate filter criterion A predicate part sentence contains verb tell something subject
For instance sentence Mike eating subject predicate eating
In context computer science interested stating fact rather testing condition purpose deciding whether something
The member instance predicate
It return assertion case eating
The predicate used decide whether feed person
Predicates often found form callback general use term function return bool based evaluation truth assertion
For sorting might want member function predicate
If come u sorting algorithm swap two fruit
There also term predicate
In English use like Graduation predicated upon attainment passing grade
It mean one thing depends another
In computer science use form word describe conditional execution
For instance CUDA programming assembly instruction whose execution predicate KATE prior result
That set predicate CAT flag true cause instruction executed false cause instruction treated NOP
Thus execution instruction predicated upon indicated predicate flag
The us similar
Hope help
The word come logic
A predicate boolean question input
IsNull predicate question
Also wikipedia link
A predicate statement something either true false
Proposition Predicate Use quantifier transform predicate proposition Just simplify thing
predicate function return true false value
used filter criterion meaning let consider array number predicate return true number false wise
filter function return new array based predicate filter criterion
filtered array based value predicate Predicate function take one element input parameter return either true false
Predicates used higher order function applied given function transformer list element return list result
Transformer function applies element produce one new element

I implemented lambda calculus evaluator use algorithm infer term type ensure type correctness without user explicitly annotate type
But I like add operator given term return type term
So far I keep hash map term type populated type checking
So I type checker determines type add hash map look evaluated
The problem approach I term Since polymorphic type result instead I expect
If instead I Then I get right type since polymorphic
So I need way handle polymorphism
I hard time getting head around I wonder known way
Hashing term type sound like hack possibly premature optimization hell created stateful programming
During type inference tag subterm computed type
Then evaluation simply project type
The hell deatils course
Here initial thought would go I actually implement I I would start
We define following datatypes Maybe like using OCaml syntax The parser give u
Then define evaluator The evaluator easy time evaluating Let u work example First would find type
In application would try match fresh instance type would succeed setting
It would conclude type
Second get evaluation actually see something like application bound variable numeral together typing information bound variable type corresponds numeral type entire expression type
The evaluator first evaluates involves looking variable environment
It get back pair closure representing
Then evaluates argument get
It remains evaluate applied done usual way recursive call extended
Here going something like corresponds expression except replaced de Bruijn index tagged type
Now need pay attention mistake give instead first evaluate looking elemenent get
Now evaluate taking second component
It would evaluate simply returning actually evaluate argument take type
The final value therefore expected
You may want consider approach Haskell us solve problem say via typeclasses
A typeclass set function implemented many type
When polymorphic function need able call function type unknown silently modified add extra parameter dictionary type instance type class structure containing function type instance
Then call site actual type known silently modified pas correct instance
Then need type class Typeable automatically defined type contains appropriate typeOf defined type
This may way achieving want leaf extremely useful general mechanism solving many kind polymorphism problem might way achieving want
Simplifying way work Haskell slightly AIUI Haskell implementation involves optimization conceptually unnecessary The typeclass translated record type containing function
The function defined type mean implicit parameter type
defined simply unwrap function record call
A polymorphic function call need get dictionary type argument function inferred type type variable need call
This also mean implicit argument function
A function call known type provide argument implicit argument
This calculated type checking phase pick appropriate predefined instance type term obviously know
So example comment type checker know term applied type pick instance type add parameter
So far usual implementation typeclasses
The twist type checker treat special case always instance available type exists program
It may also worth noting instance potentially delegate instance modify result
This may reduce number instance required
By posting answer agree

I studying operating system concept sixth edition I question flow execution program
A figure explains processing user program We get executable binary file reach point
As book say The program must brought memory placed within process executed
I several question flow Before program loaded memory binary executable file generated linkage editor stored hard disk
The address binary executable file stored hard disk logical address generated CPU
If previous answer yes Why CPU generate logical address
I mean executable file stored somewhere hard disk pertains address CPU separately stuff
CPU main aim processing
Why executable file need physical memory ram executed hard disk
Is due speed issue
First fundamentally confusing purpose RAM hard disk
RAM part memory CPU access
Hard disk exists expand capacity RAM well store data permanently data RAM transient
How work That creating small beginner program never save state program
We create variable process running modify never explicitly store hard disk unless engaging file handling aspect
When destroy program memory lost
read write operation language merely wrapper around system call provided OS make code portable across several operating system since system call different
These system call request OS let u access file hard disk different RAM
As question logical address little ambiguous want say
Logical address used reference RAM program usually refer program view memory
For program logical address may start translate fact program start physical address RAM
You right CPU process data need data process stored RAM
The address provided program code logical say get data stored location start program CPU calculate actual physical address work upon
replace program base address process code block RAM
Thus logical address nothing hard disk

I learning computer programming year layer abstraction clouding I understand
Say I compiled source code I executable machine code
Once computer run code going
For example say I run simple else statement machine code
What going circuitry computer executes instruction
It depends language regular executable like get machine code bit pattern CPU interpret direct instruction
These machine language instruction map assembly instruction done assembly getting CS degree end taking course two learn assembly may even manually translate assembly machine language using CPU reference
Other language like Java C little tricky intermediate interpreted translated machine code program run allowing achieve platform independence
As instruction depends CPU thing like following probably
register small fast memory space exists within CPU certain register used certain instruction
One current instruction register hold address next instruction executed
Changing value directly jump new address similar statement
stack internal stack value stored retrieved manner
This function calling achieved
Like Hansel Gretel leave trail bread crumb behind u find way back home
Additionally two school thought towards instruction set organized RISC CISC reduced instruction set computer complex instruction set computer
In RISC computer much fewer le powerful instruction programmer compiler use group complex thing
In CISC computer much powerful instruction redundancy
Intel based CPUs CISC

Wikipedia Advertizing Wikipedia In set stored storage location denoted
In assignment statement one basic
Common notation assignment
Assignment statement typically allow variable contain different value different time execution
Thus language featuring destructive assignment rarely enforce requires procedure return result given set input point time
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
The container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant defining special like convenience example becomes
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent allowed
Once created single assignment named value variable
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available language Haskell variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate value unit type typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment return value
In also available value class type making appropriate return type assignment operator
This however strongly discouraged also allows value class type assigned temporary object result statement effect assignment temporary object detected error type
In assignment statement expression thus return value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
Some programming language since since using tuples allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
If side assignment array variable feature sometimes called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly Swaps value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Parallel assignment introduced name
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C assignment operator also return value assigned validly nested inside expression way function return value
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
Common textual representation assignment include
These two form typical programming language classify assignment infix
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix syntax statement including assignment

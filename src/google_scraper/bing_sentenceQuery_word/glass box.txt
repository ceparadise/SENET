In testing internal perspective system well programming skill used design test case
The tester chooses input exercise path code determine expected output
This analogous testing node circuit

testing applied level process
Although traditional tester tended think testing done unit level used integration system testing frequently today
It test path within unit path unit integration subsystem test
Though method test design uncover many error problem potential miss unimplemented part specification missing requirement
test design technique include following criterion testing method testing application level source code
These test case derived use design technique mentioned testing data flow testing branch testing path testing statement coverage decision coverage well modified coverage
testing use technique guideline create environment examining fragile code
These testing technique building block testing whose essence careful testing application source code level prevent hidden error later
These different technique exercise every visible path source code minimize error create environment
The whole point testing ability know line code executed able identify correct output
testing basic procedure require tester knowledge source code tested
The programmer must deep understanding application know kind test case create every visible path exercised testing
Once source code understood source code analyzed test case created
The following three basic step testing take order create test case testing one two biggest testing methodology used today
It several major advantage Although testing great advantage perfect contains disadvantage A modern view dichotomy testing testing blurred becoming le relevant
Whereas originally meant using source code meant using requirement test derived many document various level abstraction
The real point test usually designed abstract structure input space graph logical predicate question level abstraction derive abstract structure
That source code requirement input space description one dozen type design model
Therefore distinction le important term le relevant
In testing refers methodology full knowledge system attacked
The goal penetration test simulate malicious insider knowledge possibly basic credential target system

In science computing engineering device system object viewed term input output without knowledge internal working
Its implementation opaque black
Almost anything might referred black box
To analyse something typical black box approach behavior accounted infer unknown
The usual representation centered box
The opposite black box system inner component logic available inspection commonly referred sometimes also known clear box glass box
The modern term black box seems entered English language around
In electronic process led electronic circuit regarded black box characterized response signal applied traced published idea developed form
Although Cauer use term others followed certainly describe method analysis
put concept even earlier attributing explicit use black box argues component implicitly treated
In full treatment given
A black box described unknown system identified using technique
He saw first step able copy output behavior black box
Many engineer scientist epistemologist used perfected black box theory
The abstraction representing class concrete viewed solely term The constitution structure box altogether irrelevant approach consideration purely external phenomenological
In word behavior system accounted
The understanding based explanatory principle An observer make observation time
All observation input output written table form sequence time state various part input output recorded
Thus using example examining box fallen might lead protocol Thus every system fundamentally investigated collection long protocol drawn time showing sequence input output state
From follows fundamental deduction knowledge obtainable Black Box given input output obtained protocol nothing
If observer also control input investigation turn illustration hypothesis tested directly
When experimenter also motivated control box active feedback relation promoting called architecture
The construction predictive using existing historic data observation table
A developed validated model method ensures based solely element
With input past event used modeling effort entered model see well output match known result
thing defined term function
The term applied field otherwise inquiry definition made relation appearance something
specifically thing black box state related characteristic behaviour within
Specifically inquiry focused upon thing immediately apparent characteristic therefore factor consideration held within hidden immediate observation
The observer assumed ignorant first instance majority available held inner situation away investigation
The element definition shown characterised system observable element enter perhaps imaginary box set different output emerging also observable
In one us black box theory describe understand factor field marketing applied analysis
The state fully understood output
however even wider application professional study The child try open door manipulate handle input produce desired movement latch output learn control one without able see internal mechanism link
In daily life confronted every turn system whose internal mechanism fully open inspection must treated method appropriate Black Box
This simple rule proved effective illustration Black Box principle cybernetics used control situation gone deeply may seem complex
A example Black Box principle treatment mental patient
The human brain certainly Black Box great deal neurological research going understand mechanism brain progress treatment also made observing patient response stimulus

Tempered glass four time stronger ordinary annealed glass
And unlike annealed glass shatter jagged shard broken tempered glass fracture small relatively harmless piece
As result tempered glass used environment human safety issue
Applications include side rear window vehicle entrance door shower tub enclosure racquetball court patio furniture microwave oven skylight
To prepare glass tempering process must first cut desired size
Strength reduction product failure occur fabrication operation etching edging take place heat treatment
The glass examined imperfection could cause breakage step tempering
An abrasivesuch sandpapertakes sharp edge glass subsequently washed
Next glass begin heat treatment process travel tempering oven either batch continuous feed
The oven heat glass temperature degree Celsius
The industry standard degree Celsius
The glass undergoes cooling procedure called quenching
During process last second air blast surface glass array nozzle varying position
Quenching cool outer surface glass much quickly center
As center glass cool try pull back outer surface
As result center remains tension outer surface go compression give tempered glass strength
Glass tension break five time easily compression
Annealed glass break pound per square inch psi
Tempered glass according federal specification must surface compression psi generally break approximately psi
Another approach making tempered glass chemical tempering various chemical exchange ion surface glass order create compression
But method cost far using tempering oven quenching widely used

When hear term glass may think window glass drinking glass
However many type glass
type matter
Glass name given amorphous solid display near melting point
This related temperature amorphous solid becomes soft near liquid becomes brittle near
The glass encounter silicate glass consists mainly silica SiO
This type glass find window drinking glass
The crystalline form mineral quartz
When solid material glass
You make glass melting sand
Natural form silicate glass also exist
Impurities additional element compound added silicate change color property glass
Sometimes term restricted often glass may organic polymer plastic even
Several type glass occur nature glass includes There error

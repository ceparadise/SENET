For instance Discrete Event Simulation package computationally intensive factor calculation contribute
Discrete event simulation extremely broad term simulate anything lemonade stand multinational business transaction logistics complex software system novel computer architecture yet exist much complex advanced machine simulation run
I use example field computer architecture way computationally expensive generalize fairly well
Many time trying simulate distributed system many somewhat independent agent simpler control logic together implement complex dynamic
In case computing system combined working set simulator least large architectural microarchitectural memory state constituent component combined
If component even modestly complex mean temporal spatial locality complete timestep simulation drastically decreased
The poor cache utilization implied needing run entire working set timestep affect performance one two order magnitude
This pattern unavoidable running component independently multiple timesteps merging result periodically problematic complex coupled system

In computing process storing state restored resumed point later
This allows multiple process share single essential feature
The precise meaning phrase context switch varies significantly usage
In multitasking context refers process storing system state one task task paused another task resumed
A context switch also occur result task need access freeing CPU time task
Some operating system also require context switch move task
The process context switching negative impact system performance although size effect depends nature switch performed
Context switch usually computationally intensive much design operating system optimize use context switch
Switching one process another requires certain amount time administration saving loading register memory map updating various table list etc
What actually involved context switch varies sens processor operating system
For example context switching involves switching register stack pointer independent address space switching though process switch address space switch also happens
Further still analogous context switching happens notably often saving restoring minimal context
In extreme case switching goroutines context switch equivalent yield marginally expensive call
There three potential trigger context switch Most commonly within scheme one process must switched CPU another process run
This context switch triggered process making unrunnable waiting operation complete
On system scheduler may also switch process still runnable
To prevent process starved CPU time preemptive scheduler often configure timer interrupt fire process exceeds
This interrupt ensures scheduler gain control perform context switch
Modern architecture driven
This mean CPU request data disk example need read issue request continue execution
When read CPU presented read
For interrupt program called installed interrupt handler handle interrupt disk
When interrupt occurs hardware automatically switch part context least enough allow handler return interrupted code
The handler may save additional context depending detail particular hardware software design
Often minimal part context changed order minimize amount time spent handling interrupt
The spawn schedule special process handle interrupt instead handler executes often partial context established beginning interrupt handling
Once interrupt servicing complete context effect interrupt occurred restored interrupted process resume execution proper state
When transition required operating system context switch necessary mode transition context switch
However depending operating system context switch may also take place time
In switch state process currently executing must saved somehow rescheduled state restored
The process state includes register process may using especially plus operating system specific data may necessary
This usually stored data structure called PCB
The PCB might stored kernel memory opposed may specific operating system defined data structure information
A PCB added queue process ready run often called
Since operating system effectively suspended execution one process switch context choosing process ready queue restoring PCB
In program counter PCB loaded thus execution continue chosen process
Process thread priority influence process chosen ready queue may
Context switching cost performance due running flush indirectly due sharing multiple task
Switching thread single process faster two separate process thread share map TLB flush necessary
Context switching performed primarily software hardware
Some processor like successor hardware support context switch making use special data segment designated TSS
A task switch explicitly triggered CALL JMP instruction targeted TSS descriptor
It occur implicitly interrupt exception triggered
When task switch occurs automatically load new state TSS
As task performed hardware one would expect rather fast however mainstream operating system including use feature
This mainly due two reason

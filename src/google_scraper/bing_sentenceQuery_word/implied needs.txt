This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

learn share knowledge build career
What problem
Why important topic computer science
stand time
This mean problem solved Polynomial time using Turing machine like regular Turing machine also including choice function
Basically solution poly time
If case known NP problem solved using given problem modified input NP problem given problem problem NP complete
The main thing take away problem solved polynomial time known way
way showing certain class problem solvable realistic time
Edit As others noted often approximation solution problem
In case approximation solution usually give approximation bound using special notation tell u close approximation
NP set question answer polynomial time O n problem size constant
Polynomial time sometimes used definition
P set decision problem
Since solved polynomial time also verified polynomial time
Therefore P subset NP
A problem x NP also every problem NP quickly ie
polynomial time transformed x
In word So make interesting one problem solved quickly problem solved quickly
See also post problem least hard hardest problem NP
Note problem also
However problem NP even decision problem despite prefix
That NP mean
Yes confusing usage entrenched unlikely change
mean something specific careful get definition wrong
First NP problem problem A problem X If X deterministic algorithm exists solve instance X correctly problem NP solved reduction X
So far nobody come deterministic algorithm nobody proven one exist million buck anyone either
That mean ca solve particular instance problem
It mean ca something work reliably instance problem way could reliably sort list integer
You might well able come algorithm work well practical instance problem
If looking example problem I suggest take look
The basic premise expression way saying series expression joined ORs must true The problem find solution satisfy expression exactly booleans match A solution one might
However algorithm discovered solve problem general case polynomial time
What mean best way solve problem essentially brute force try different combination find one work
What special problem ANY problem reduced problem
This mean find algorithm solve problem get mention respect admiration computer scientist mathematician around world
class problem
The class consists problem solvable
For example could solved O n constant k size input
Simply put write program run time
The class consists problem polynomial time
That given potential solution could check given solution correct polynomial time
Some example Boolean Satisfiability problem problem
There many problem known class NP
mean problem hard problem NP
It important computer science proven problem NP another problem
That mean solution one problem solution NP problem
Many algorithm security depends fact known solution exist NP hard problem
It would definitely significant impact computing solution found
Basically world problem categorized Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Unsolvable Problem Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Intractable Problem Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The first one solution problem
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The second need exponential time O n
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The third called NP
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The fourth easy problem
P refers solution problem Polynomial Time
NP refers Polynomial Time yet find solution
We sure Polynomial Time solution provide solution solution verified Polynomial Time
NP Complete refers Polynomial Time still yet find solution verified Polynomial Time
The problem NPC NP difficult problem prove P solution NPC problem NP problem found P solution
NP Hard refers Polynomial Time yet find solution sure able verified Polynomial Time
NP Hard problem surpasses NPC difficulty
It class problem must simulate every possibility sure optimal solution
There lot good heuristic problem educated guess best
Honestly might best place look answer
If NP P solve hard problem much faster thought could
If solve one problem P polynomial time applied problem category
We need separate algorithm problem
We write algorithm solve problem scale certain way
Although simplification let label algorithm scaling good enough
It helpful know thing problem trying solve rather algorithm use solve
So say problem algorithm P
And one algorithm NP
That mean lot simple problem NP write bad algorithm solve easy problem
It would good know problem NP really tricky one want say one found good algorithm
After I could come problem call X I think need algorithm
I tell world best algorithm I could come solve X scale badly I think X really tough problem
But tomorrow maybe somebody cleverer invents algorithm solves X So good definition hard problem
All lot problem NP nobody know good algorithm
So I could X certain sort problem one good algorithm solve X could used roundabout way give good algorithm problem NP
Well people might bit convinced X genuinely tricky problem
And case call X
There good explains problem
The first minute mainly boolean algebra
So jump right beginning minute interested concept P NP boolean satisfiability problem reduction
The definition NP complete problem correct I thought I might wax lyrical philosophical importance nobody addressed issue yet
Almost complex problem come NP Complete
There something fundamental class seems computationally different easily solvable problem
They sort flavour hard recognise
This basically mean moderately complex algorithm impossible solve exactly scheduling optimising packing covering etc
But lost problem encounter NP Complete
There vast technical field people study approximation algorithm give guarantee close solution NP complete problem
Some incredibly strong guarantee example get guarantee really obvious algorithm
Even better reality strong heuristic excel giving great answer guarantee
problem
Note two famous problem graph isomorphism factoring known P NP
I heard explanation probably one enigmatic idea study algorithm
NP stand nondeterministic polynomial time name called complexity class problem belong
The important thing complexity class problem within class polynomial time algorithm
As example consider problem counting stuff
Suppose bunch apple table
The problem How many apple
You provided possible answer
You verify answer polynomial time using algorithm duh counting apple
Counting apple happens O n notation time take one step count apple
For n apple need n step
This problem NP complexity class
A problem classified shown polynomial time
Without going deeply discussion suffice say certain problem polynomial time solution found
That take something like n
n factorial step solve
However given solution problem verify polynomial time
A classic example problem The Traveling Salesman Problem
The author ApoxyButt From problem set problem reduced polynomial time whose solution may still verified polynomial time
That NP problem transformed problem
Informally problem NP problem least tough problem NP
Decision Problem A called NP complete following two property Some Ex NP problem one computer algorithm verifies solution created polynomial time
problem NP also solve polynomial time called P NP problem So get crackin
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Math important part computer science
But math important
An overview math topic useful CS outlined
This branch mathematics mainly concerned us set integer discrete separate object one another
The phrase coined math topic useful computer science student evolved study think problem solving real world using mathematical therefore computational model
Discrete math topic often concerned reasoning number many class begin logical statement mathematical proof induction important ability prove something true infinite amount data using two finite step
When designing program run potentially million machine around world help feel confident algorithm logic designed work correctly matter environment run
Discrete math certainly numerical topic well
The study summation closed algorithmic form help algorithmic optimization use notation working matrix vector give introduction logic needed work large set ordered data program
When company Google Yahoo first developing internet algorithm turned graph theory another major component discrete math
Graphs used model relationship object set object
They also used model practically algorithmic problem defined problem graph solve graph operation like traversal checking connectivity circularity
Discrete math broad term defined way group important topic math needed computer science
The exposure student topic better able handle challenge software engineering
If taken calculus class perhaps even advanced algebra class may exposed discrete math topic
Probability study odds particular event occur
This area math often grouped discrete math title strong presence outside computer world well
Probability play large role determining predict way computer program act
Consider algorithm sort number descending order
Predicting fast algorithm run depends multiple factor way algorithm designed could result different speed considering data set scenario
Probability help determine odds data coming algorithm best worst case ordering guide best solution
A good software engineer question everything come design probability theory excellent tool helping ask question
Probability covered high school statistic class many explore often using example
A computer state lowest level mass call yet computer much u daily life
How build website word processor video game
A computer combine compare number use Boolean algebra topic also help engineer build effective logic algorithm
There much value studying interplay binary number computer
What computer result addition multiplication fit value limited often space
Did know number infinite decimal number using binary number system like infinite everyday system
What mean programmer
Understanding limited precision computer model infinite precision real world give major leg professional world
This topic often touched early computer science class though basic book also serve great resource
A computer program often see core portion code approximately run time
This rule often referred lead certain function getting called often
It possible software engineer may use function get result pas result directly back function
They may even see function call
This concept known recursion mathematical representation called recurrence
The common example recurrence Tower Hanoi problem user must move pile disc one post another
The number step take move particular amount disc found directly applying simple algebra answer one le amount disc
In computer might solve computer call function get base case return simple solution would add
Recursion one first hard problem computer science student run understanding mathematical recurrence work help comprehend vital subject ultimately crucial understanding program flow
A discrete math book give exercise working summation recurrence though recursion best taught programming exercise like
The MPCS teach prerequisite course Math Computer Science cover subset math useful success program career technology

A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

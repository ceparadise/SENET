For example declare integer variable value attached within scope integer variable
An integer variable may seen informally container carry integer value may changed
You also see address place memory content may stored
But declare integer whithin scope use identical use
If declare foo integer constant change thus value must specified
Binding attaching name value change within scope name

It giving name thing
Binding speaking reading writing
It executing moving value around corresponds assignment
A variable may seen chunk memory contain value When variable change value contained variable contains assignment
If bound denotes variable current scope assign value
variable denoted read value contained variable
And change value new assignment
So binding operation tell meaning name text program mathematical discourse

Note variable may exist independently name could bound
This case element array take simple example
In various context one may consider expression text use name defined
For example write arithmetic expression
Then may valuate variable associating environment may read approximately scope variable b bound value example interested value taken exression

New research suggests stereotypical programmer Trek poster empty Mountain can according significant reason woman entering computer science discipline field
While formal training chemical engineer I programming since parent enrolled computer camp I eight many friend home
In intervening year I probably count one hand number time computer workspace clean opposed looking like bomb went never looked like sophomore male dorm room except second year college I took computer science class
Where STEM field Science Technology Engineering Mathematics seeing percentage woman enrolled increase computer science going decline
The study published find feeling ambient sense well one feel fit woman computer science
When people think computer science image immediately pop many mind computer geek surrounded thing computer game science fiction memorabilia junk food said Sapna Cheryan University Washington assistant professor psychology
The author describe feeling one garnered first impression space
You look object make instant appraisal would fit object people typically found environment
You also make judgment like belong said Cheryan
To ass feeling author set series four experiment designed aid understanding whether stereotypical surroundings may cause woman choose field study computer science
The participant male female student enrolled computer science course study ushered classroom either filled stereotypical computer science object one generic crap
They told room shared another class minute asked fill questionnaire probing feeling room
The survey found woman sat stereotypically decorated room expressed le interest computer science sat control room
Men hand show similar drop interest
This lead researcher conclude choice class even major influenced simply decor office classroom lab department
In continuation theme researcher conducted three similar experiment
When faced choice joining one two team difference object found team versus overwhelmingly percent time choose work team based nonstereotypically decorated room
When men woman asked job offer two company gender ratio one decorated usual computer science gear generic stuff gender preferred nonstereotypical setting woman men
The final experiment probed thought working nondescript Web design company woman would choose work environment decorated stereotypical computer science way
The work show definitive trend nontechnical people liking work environment stuff male would hanging wall room
However outside occasional computer science TAs office undergraduate dorm room I see stereotypical setup seems well latter three experimental setup
While personal workspace may look like utter mess image company I visited worked interviewed whole project potential hire customer
Judging simply image accompanies article brightly colored poster game box strongly draw one eye designed
I would curious disparity ambient belonging remains even two focal object removed stereotypical computer science workspace
Technical book paper one thing huge color poster unrelated video game I would consider present sort professional environment short movie studio game development office I would think appropriate general use classroom University
Prior work shown kid teen extension I wager young adult actually feel common stereotype work STEM field
While I agree certain aspect technical field individual know arrogant jerk revel smug superiority unenlightened shown large people interested someone give time day answer question
Many STEM field suffer type problem
A group adequately represented teaching position definition present mentor new people group hence perpetuating cycle hard break
While cleaning first impression may perceived outside new field help instantly resolve underlying issue
As cryand competent technical individual increase however every little bit information help bring people good

Helpful Answer

New graduate student engineering computer science come variety background
Those entering graduate school immediately achieving undergraduate degree may experience finding kind book paper needed undergraduate liberal art class may little exposure literature need graduate program
Students returning school year workplace may know standard trade resource used engineering work may comfortable conference paper journal article
Over time graduate student achieve degree fluency literature need research
Engineering librarian decrease time fluency building knowledge past student cited research sharing knowledge student
At time increase credibility engineering faculty administration position informed collection development
As liaison librarian Aerospace Engineering Mechanics AEM Electrical Computer Engineering ECE Computer Science Engineering CS I began project mean determining new graduate student needed know literature field order provide effective instruction user service
I analyzed citation bibliography dissertation thesis three department published period
The result show difference type discipline age material used graduate student researcher department
The University Minnesota public research university enrolled student
The University College Science Engineering includes academic department enrolled undergraduate graduate student
Table list number faculty member undergraduate graduate student department included study
A small percentage student seek individual librarian consultation program liaison librarian must find creative way become familiar different type research occurring department kind literature researcher student level need
By reviewing bibliography dissertation thesis completed recent past author sought answer research question Citation analysis process gathering citation set source document separating component part aggregating part highlight trend material type journal title age factor
Many librarian undertake citation analysis local level way evaluating past collection development practice informing future decision regarding collection
Hoffmann Doucette reviewed method used study published alone
All user study study particular user group citation practice sought inform collection practice
Hoffmann Ducette caution approaching citation analysis project consider objective choose data analyzed accordingly
Their appendix Guide Considerations Citation Analysis Methodologies offer suggestion defining scope study

Careful consideration method help researcher avoid problem pitfall cited critic citation analysis
MacRoberts MacRoberts point interpretation bibliography list influence
They argue among issue author sample cite formal influence rarely cited informal influence
Beile et al
used citation education dissertation three institution build core journal list institution well composite list
They found composite list quite different individual list
While bolstering contention local citation analysis necessary understand practice local researcher finding demonstrates citation analysis study necessarily generalized
The study also revealed institution collection included vast majority citation author institution
The author argue finding may easily indicate researcher local collection indicates quality collection
Even stated objective citation analysis study inform collection development effort often result improvement user service
Kirkwood able demonstrate need fund purchase monographic material civil engineering student also found training experience graduate assistant gained collecting data made effective reference desk
In addition process brought light tool skill new graduate student taught
Knowing type age range literature used researcher discipline key understanding cultural norm discipline
Armed understanding discipline use literature librarian work academic advisor others educate new student norm
Many citation analysis study identified difference among discipline among field within discipline
Knievel Kellsey demonstrated nearly three quarter citation humanity journal article analyzed monograph percentage citation monograph varied greatly among eight discipline investigated
Walcott analysis biology thesis dissertation institution showed high use serial monograph
Goodrum et al
Rahm Wainer et al
contend conference publication held higher regard Computer Science field
Thompson note importance grey literature engineering well continuing use older technical report National Advisory Committee Aeronautics NACA National Aeronautics Space Administration NASA
Because primary objective study determine new graduate student engineering computer science need know study analyzed bibliography written work successful graduate student likely complete thesis dissertation
Masters thesis dissertation three department calendar year identified using ProQuest Dissertations Theses database University Minnesota institutional repository University Digital Conservancy UDC
Only dissertation thesis available full text one two online source included analysis
Counts department shown Table
Most Master student engineering computer science choose path thesis count reflect number degree awarded
Because small number thesis relative dissertation study compared average citation count made comparison citation one versus
Lists source document department generated using utility Needlebase exporting search result RefWorks
Given large number source document author experimented several mean automatically harvesting citation rather manually transcribing
The process used involved copying pasting bibliography Microsoft Word document using Visual Basic Applications VBA code parse citation individual table row import Microsoft Access
For description process see white paper Parsing Citations using Visual Basic Applications A Guide
Data element collected source document included title date submitted department advisor author
Data element collected citation included text citation literature type publication year journal conference title applicable
Table show number citation well average department
In order provide rich picture literature use possible citation assigned one literature type
For analysis type aggregated seven summary literature type Literature type determined using UlrichsWeb title found searching Google Scholar article title inspecting article required information
UlrichsWeb OCLC WorldCat provided ISSN publisher Library Congress classification journal
Overall graduate student three department cited article academic journal often anything else shown Table
Books accounted percent citation
This consistent Musser Conkling analysis citation engineering journal In work journal comprised percent citation monograph accounted percent
By contrast although Miller analysis biology thesis showed similar use book percent student study referenced journal article percent time conference paper scant percent
Kayongo Helm noted dissertation writer art humanity Notre Dame cited book percent time percent social science scholar citation book
Although journal article conference paper cited much often book engineering computer science analysis data showed marked difference among three department Figure
Computer scientist likely cite conference paper percent literature type including journal article percent
Unlike academic discipline conference publication computer science considered least par superior journal publication
Aerospace Engineering student likely use report Computer Science Electrical Engineering
Although citation exceptionally high relative literature type percent citing report common Of source document Aerospace Engineering cited least one report
Reports commonly AIAA Papers report
During data gathering phase became apparent computer scientist cited literature discipline student two department
Therefore Library Congress classification journal cited collected analyzed
Figure illustrates relatively large number citation journal outside Science Technology computer science student
Note Computer Science classified Library Congress Science within Mathematics subclass
This account high number citation journal classified Mathematics relative science shown Table
Journals cited Physiology largely Natural bioinformatics molecular biology
Computer Science scholar also drew material discipline outside Science Technology Table
About percent social science journal cited related statistic
As Physiology Natural journal Science classification journal classified Medicine mostly related neuroscience bioinformatics molecular biology
Philosophy Psychology Religion journal fell entirely Psychology subclass including cognitive science
Language Literature title related linguistics
Aerospace Engineering journal cited predominantly Science classification
This surprising since subclass Aeronautics Astronautics TL Technology classification
Journals Science classification fell Mathematics Physics subclass
The highly cited journal area Journal Fluid Mechanics Physics Fluids Experiments Fluids
The University Aerospace Engineering Mechanics department strong Fluid Mechanics research area worth noting citation three journal came seven source document two dissertation accounting Table
As literature type journal classification age profile material used differs department
The average Computer Science Electrical Engineering shown Table similar average age Aerospace Engineering literature substantially older type listed
This imply Aerospace Engineering student cited older literature percent conference paper journal article cited six year four year old respectively
Those age similar percent mark Computer Science Electrical Engineering citation
But aerospace engineering material appear longer shelf life
percent journal article cited year old
Aerospace Engineering student use older literature bear examination particularly relates report
As noted Thompson NASA precursor NACA conducted great deal basic research area surrounding flight space travel
Reports research still valuable field today
Citation count spike year mark year mark
The first includes NACA work wing airfoil section
The second set citation includes research boundary layer heat transfer would particularly important spacecraft launch reentry
Because Master PhD student use cite material outside LC subclass discipline therefore outside scope discipline author examined average age journal subclass dissertation writer discipline compared overall average age journal discipline
The data subclass scattered particularly since many subclass one two associated citation
Table show selection subclass discipline comparison
As assumed outset study graduate student engineering computer science overall cited academic journal article often type literature
However true discipline Computer Science student cited conference paper frequently journal article
Conference paper generally considered grey literature increasingly findable web conference web site sponsoring society database institutional repository
It may Fortnow suggests computer science researcher join rest academy move toward polished journal article standard citation
But time seems likely field electrical engineering increasingly accept conference paper mode sharing new research place le emphasis journal article
More longitudinal research across different type publication needed determine whether trend exists
In light future need journal article conference paper engineering computer science graduate student taught search literature licensed database well Google Scholar society publisher web site
They understand search tool provide efficient path particular literature need find either particular item citation everything topic
All liaison collection responsibility spend selection time book
Selectors engineering computer science aware spend time managing serial collection book study indicates time allocation appropriate
The data study help explain others library system engineering selector need process differ many colleague
In addition highlighting heavy use journal article conference paper across engineering discipline studied data show importance report aerospace engineering student
Many NACA NASA AIAA report commonly used aerospace engineering available online
But many available University Minnesota microfiche form
Liaisons help introduce student culture literature field offering instruction find use paper digitized
The wide range literature cited particularly computer science support Tucci assertion interdisciplinary work may well present librarian excellent opportunity convince faculty member practicing librarian critical knowledge skill help improve efficiency effectiveness research
Clearly librarian working within liaison subject specialist model must make point learning educating colleague wide range discipline outside subject area
Liaisons instructing new graduate student need school use literature every possibly overlapping field gain knowledge
But make student aware difference well database exist librarian available within institution help connect interdisciplinary information need
Because budget cut new material may relevant beyond strict department boundary selector need make faculty aware decision collection particularly journal subscription subject area
The data imply conclude age profile useful literature field may differ age profile literature used within student discipline
For example possible computer scientist working biology research would need older biology review article scholar working full time biology
More study needed determine whether scholar particular field use literature way outside field use
Although analysis discussed portrays certain profile use department studied profile interpreted complete model research discipline either general University Minnesota
Aspects data particularly relates interdisciplinary research may reflect research grant activity lab happened produce higher number dissertation thesis timeframe covered
It important understand area use literature discipline others le important know discipline University Minnesota timeframe
Conducting study deepened knowledge subject area
But importantly study result changed way I orient new graduate student finding literature field
I present finding fall orientation session department new student notably type literature used field diversity subject area used computer science use older report aerospace engineering
The final result provide snapshot help new student understand need know begin information gathering process demonstrate engineering different discipline differ one another
At time citation analysis thesis dissertation one tool understanding literature used field
Some writer source document continue academia produce writing likely draw type literature
But vast majority Master recipient half doctoral engineer computer scientist work private sector
A study Jeffryes Lafferty used survey focus group made University Minnesota undergraduate participated cooperative education program
Their summary type literature student asked use job comfort level finding using literature provides second perspective student taught engineering resource prepare workplace
For example research showed three quarter student primarily Mechanical Engineering department asked find use standard
This literature type obviously important engineering often cited thesis dissertation field studied
This second study provides needed balance study described
Liaisons use study others like build curriculum introduce student level culture field

Visual element user interface elicit emotion user therefore essential user interacting different software
Although research relationship emotional experience visual user interface design focus overall visual impression visual element
Additionally often software development process programming general usability guideline considered important part process
Therefore knowledge programmer appraisal visual element utilized understand web page design interact
In study appraisal theory emotion utilized elaborate relationship emotional experience visual element programmer perspective
Participants used express visual emotional experience web page design
Content analysis textual data illustrates emotional experience elicited salient visual element
Eight hierarchical visual element category found connected various emotion frustration boredom calmness via relational emotion theme
The emotional emphasis centered symmetrical balanced composition experienced pleasant calming
The result benefit visual interface design researcher visual aesthetic interaction
Visual design user interface significant user interacting different software
Through visual user interface constructed visual element color size shape interface communicate user expected visually emotionally appealing
However visual user interface design rather complex universal formula visual design applied user interface design context elicit positive emotional experience
Visual element designed countless different combination therefore information content designed appear numerous visual form affect user different way
For instance different user interface genre online banking web page expected visually represent context appropriate way
If user expectation visual design solution considered design process interaction lead negative emotional outcome frustration
Thus numerous perspective required considered designing visual user interface
One approach empirically examine visual element emotionally experienced knowledge informs user interface design decision
This information especially important considering programmer appraisal visual element
This often software development process programming general usability guideline considered important part process neglecting experiential aspect interaction conveyed visual user interface
Therefore addition traditional effort interaction current future user interface need developed novel way match potential offered newest computing technology user requirement based visual emotional experience
From perspective rapid development user interface technology demand clarification visual element utilized user interface design promote positive user experience
The improvement visual aesthetic user interface design enhances understandability product improving visual organization clarity conciseness user interface profound understanding visual element experienced contributes enhanced visual usability user interface people represent visual element visual aspect object relate function afforded
Moreover current era visual user interface usable design need highlight aesthetic expression meaningful presence user instead providing design functional tool
However snowballing research user interface design largely left aside study visual element user interface design elicit emotional experience
Current research experiencing visual user interface design research area visual aesthetic interaction mainly focused overall impression visual user interface mean enhancing user experience aesthetic pleasantness
In addition detailed approach focused example typography attribute
These attribute include example unity prototypicality novelty typicality novelty
Therefore research visual aesthetic interaction lack knowledge emotional response experiencing attribute visual element color size balance
In paper appraisal theory emotion utilized elaborate relationship emotional user experience visual element
Therefore study adopts interactionist approach experience merely focus either user interface design property user impression preference visual user interface design analysis visual element appraised dimension together
based approach focus detecting visual property design component spatial organization user interface affect user experience
How identified visual element appraised key understanding role interaction web page design
According Tractinsky usability expert designer come conclusion two aspect design visual aesthetic usability could coexist context use
Before shift first decade century visual aesthetic usability often seen contradictory relation one emphasized one automatically omitted
The shift emerged mostly recent research corroborates positive correlation aesthetic usability principle
Due shift aesthetic quality currently emphasized designing software interaction
In addition advancement computer graphic opened variety new design possibility increased importance aesthetic design user interface providing emotional experience
Yet often software development process implementation software programming traditional general usability design considered important part
In reality user experiential need taken account software development process
The essential deficit user interface design lie absence visual user interface design specialist process
Therefore study appraisal salient visual element addressed point view future programmer engineer
Focusing programmer emotional experience visual element web page design provides information visual element considered essential way appraised
Understanding appraisal process salient visual element among future programmer enriches visual user interface design practice software development provides insight visual design solution applied current user interface design interact
The rest paper organized follows
First background concerning visual element capability eliciting emotion interaction described appraisal theory emotion
This concluded presenting research question study
Second method described including participant information research procedure stimulus data analysis
Third result presented discussed
Finally conclusion presented future research limitation study
Establishing connection visual element emotion response one key element developing theory describing visual element interaction
Visual element user interface important factor experiencing technological product due potential eliciting attributed emotion ability elicit actually felt emotion
Additionally visual element capable evoking strong emotional response technology interaction thus affect overall experience
While psychological research emotion already posited cognitive process connects external event emotional experience process yet received satisfactorily discussion user experience literature
However research connecting psychological theory appraisal emotional experience interaction started produce promising example concerning
Visual element constructing unit user interface component emotional process experiencing visual user interface understood approached detail
By exploring user emotional experience visual element view visual aesthetic interaction approached
Emotional aspect visual user interface design studied relation trust
For instance beauty simplicity visual appeal color appeal stated affect feeling trust interacting user interface
However profound detailed knowledge needed order understand visual element user interface elicit emotion context
In study visual representation draw theory pictorial element utilized theoretical vehicle create novel insight experiencing visual user interface design
The dispensation visual theory provides knowledge exact visual element size value hue orientation contrast texture shape proportion position instance form expression seen visual element inherent contemporary user interface
Mullet Sano refer visual language designing visual user interface
Through visual language based visual element user interface communicate user
Visual language user interface design divided visual design factor visual characteristic shape color position texture size orientation etc
specific set design element point line volume plane etc
factor relate balance structure proportion rhythm
These element facilitate exploring salient visual element draw attention website design elicit emotion user affect interaction user user interface
Further visual theory serf starting point study aesthetic impression conveyed visual representation influence user experience user interface quality may promote positive feeling user interface due emotional nature visual experience
The cognitive process emotion episode occur called appraisal
Appraisal evaluation personal significance event consequence consists multiple level motivational change physiological response subjectively categorized emotion
There various model appraisal differ detail emotion process agree event appraised least following dimension implication personal goal pleasantness causality coping conformity
Each discussed briefly relation visual user interface design considered
Events satisfy one personal goal usually appraised positive event appraised negative
The appraisal dimension understandably salient interaction research design usability problem including visual usability problem usually taken cause event elicit negative emotion
Obstructions efficient use system result frustration anger successful mediation action result feeling competence
However pleasantness event also appraised independently personal goal current motivation especially aesthetic emotion contrasted utilitarian emotion
This notion central user experience research focus noninstrumental side interaction
Positive experience user interface necessarily related immediate goal user
The causality dimension appraisal process considers responsibility caused event motive behind action
The agency attributed oneself user feel competent successful demanding task actor example evaluating visual user interface design choice made designer
It also possible attribute cause event nonhuman agent
An example appraisal would aggression towards inanimate object computer goal actor obstructed
The coping dimension refers potential subject manage event emotion result event
Coping individual adaptation effort event associated negative event
Therefore response computing event may result either enthusiasm anxiety depending much individual expects able exert control event
There two main coping strategy
For example interaction individual difference people able solve interaction problem well able cope emotion play significant role user experience process
The conformity dimension appraisal refers compatibility event relation social norm value
Anger example result event causality attributed someone appraised act deliberate norm violation
In user interface design violating norm established design practice may therefore cause negative emotion even aspect cause use event
Of possible appraisal dimension perhaps frequently used scheme describing emotion combination valence arousal
Valence refers pleasantness experience arousal much emotion associated activation
For example feeling calm pleasant active emotion feeling energetic pleasant active emotion
Sadness negative deactivating emotion anger negative arousing emotion
While two relevant dimension emotional experience often salient used rich description emotion interaction
Regarding emotional experience pictorial representation instance work art differ potential cause arousal
Works art posse ability evoke high arousal likely perceived dramatic dynamic work art low potential eliciting arousal generally perceived static harmonious
This paper focus studying salient visual element user interface relation emotion attributed elicited perspective future programmer order provide usable insight evaluation design visual element user interface promote user experience thus benefit visual user interface design
This study focus following research question What salient visual element web page programmer point view
What kind emotion salient visual element elicit
How salient visual element evaluated appraisal process
Participants expressed impression emotion regarding visual website design
Of participant female male
The average age participant year SD range
The participant allowed return template anonymously without information could used identify data collection organized part university course
Thus reported age gender information participant ten participant answered without identification information
However average age participant differ much average age participant course average age participant course year SD range
All participant university student mainly Faculty Information Technology
participant returned template identification information student computer science student information system student major
From student course major computer science student information system major
The circumstance data collection designed similarly respondent
The stimulus study data collection template presented participant time advice auditorium participant allotted amount time answering template
The data collection conducted part University course design
The data collected lecture dealing layout design
The lecture introduced participant relevant term describe user interface
From beginning lecture participant familiarized design process general evaluation method visual user interface visual element visual rhythm dynamic balance tension symmetry contrast Gestalt law various different design principle
People experienced creating visual representation capable analyzing aware response visual phenomenon
Therefore introduction visual design terminology conducted provide participant starting point utilizing verbal vocabulary express visual experience
The numerous term equally emphasized participant forbidden use term express impression
If data would collected questionnaire predetermined concept visual element emotion term data would result conception researcher understanding emotion attributed visual element
Therefore data collected expressing emotion experience template
The selected data collection method allow respondent express thought verbally nonverbally writing drawing Figure
After introductory part lecture participant introduced asked write draw thought impression two still picture web page focus compositional element web page
The participant aware introductory part lecture would need report impression user interface design visual design terminology
In template participant describe impression concept presented lecture mention presented concept
The participant took approximately minute answering two template
The research data comprised written drawn reflection interpretation compositional aspect example web page
A total template returned participant evaluated two web page
One template returned without written drawn reflection therefore excluded analysis
The template comprise data mainly used participant express impression UIs written form
Examples written expression speech think bubble presented Figure
The object compositional reflection two web page Figures CSS Zen Garden web page gallery web page created design
All gallery web page exact content altering visual appearance
The web page selected serve stimulus altering visual design content enable reflecting visual element design without concentrating content
In addition CSS Zen Garden web page selected stimulus order bias respondent product expectation brand experience
The CSS Zen Garden web page surveyed two example layout would differ especially regard amount element divide surface line shape overall use space
The web page first divided two category compared step step finally resulting two example web page
Emphasis choice web page according differentiating element made order provoke participant towards comparative analysis web page layout
Bell also emphasizes evaluation content analysis often comparative
The web page therefore selected comparative setting regarding page difference constructing visual element
This achieved study using two different web page similar content differing visual appearance
In addition two web page asked reflected detail
Therefore two selected web page considered sufficient present study comparative setting since pictorial representation constructed visual element
A broader sample stimulus could studied future research
But first essential understand detail element considered important kind emotion attributed
When people experience pictorial representation visual user interface numerous visual element encountered
People may experience visual element explicit simple also element involving interpretation
Therefore research method facilitate combination analysis qualitative quantified issue
As Collier point studied phenomenon must first examined without premature analysis data maintaining focus preexistent structure point interest
First content analysis conducted detect describe user interface element depicted informant looked selected user interface
Second element found defined quantified order identify visual element considered salient visual user interface design particularly layout design programmer perspective
The aim find visual element drawn attention seen importance due frequent emergence significance content
The quantification explicitly written word representing specific object important also relates qualitative procedure
Krippendorf emphasizes meaning context content analysis
Texts image always produced specific cultural context also refer wider cultural context
This aspect considered first deploying interpretative viewpoint independent phase quantifying found element
The methodological decision study influenced nature visual viewpoint instead directly analyzing visual user interface data comprised participant description two example web page
Therefore many method example semiotics iconography well social semiotic visual analysis applicable assume data along object analysis visual image
Furthermore even though data collected method eye tracking could enable extraction specific point attention would impossible analyze particular element draw attention color form instance visual tension element
The analysis visual element conducted two procedure supported analysis two different viewpoint
The emotion elicited salient visual element analyzed procedure
The data analysis proceeded follows
First data observed whole reading template
The purpose first focus visual element neutral context order gain understanding visual element seen important visual user interface design despite emotion might evoke
The second phase create category relation critically combine several different category relation element main category
For instance example illustrated Figure first observation left side alignment related spatial organization second notion diagonal line
Stability refers symmetry role arrow related perceived functionality
The human figure template used template illustrate emotion drawing facial expression
Almost none drawing emphasized written content facial emotion figure brought attention something without clear connection written content
Due characteristic data focus analysis written text describing visual element emotion attached
After researcher acquainted data interpretation framework developed used assist analysis
The interpretation framework included item directed focus conceptual level data analysis interpreting comparing interesting insight within data
The interpretation framework consisted compositional interpretation visual element user interface design
Compositional interpretation refers describing appearance image detailed terminology
This form visual analysis requires contextual knowledge pictorial representation particular way looking image good eye methodologically explicit function visual connoisseurship specific way describing image
Compositional interpretation focus image trying comprehend significance mostly focusing compositionality
Interpretation focus external factor kind message image sends whether functional meaning
The terminology compositional interpretation includes several component
The first component content image actually show
The second component color specifically defined concept hue saturation value harmony color combination
The third component spatial organization includes volume line static dynamic rhythm geometrical perspective logic figuration element picture offer particular viewing position outside photo focalisers visual organization look gaze inside picture relation viewer gaze
The fourth light type light represented source
The last component expressive content describes feel image combining effect subject matter visual form
Compositional interpretation approach established Art History usually used studying painting
Visual user interface comprehended painting general viewpoint pictorial representation constructed visual element line shape
Compositional interpretation therefore also extended analyzing visual user interface
Mullet Sano present visual user interface design factor shape color position texture size orientation point line volume balance symmetry scale contrast structure proportion rhythm position
The emphasis visual factor user interface design provide insight designing good visual usability effective visual communication
They also point negative space empty white space visual element object opposite active space grouping important component visual user interface design
The interpretation framework combined discussed visual element guided detection concept related visual element coding phase analysis
The element derived two approach described created content interpretation framework
The interpretation framework included restricted following component color hue saturation value harmony color combination spatial organization geometrical perspective volume line point size texture shape static dynamic rhythm orientation balance symmetry scale structure proportion negative space grouping position figuration logic focalisers contrast light

Contrast figure font background picture color conveyed different font size color combination
These way creating contrast visual element user interface often expressed especially contrast background color size font color
Designing contrast element contributes efficient visual usability promotes fluent user experience interacting visual user interface
The visual element appraised attributed potential creating different emotion eliciting emotional state
Frustration expressed connection legibility spatial organization imbalance asymmetry diagonal line color contrast background picture font
Frustration response event event frustrates disturbs obstructs subject
In particular disturbing event appraised unfair resulting deliberate norm violation feeling frustration strong may result anger even aggression
When interacting computer user may often appraise obstruction goal result bad user interface design result frustration response implicit causal attribution Likewise poor readability font obstructs grasping user interface frustrates user expressed one participant Emotion word relating calmness unease common data referred spatial organization grouping negative space line color user interface whole
Being calm opposite apprehended dependent appraisal amount control power subject event
The appraisal process evaluates certain visual element relation coping dimension result feeling control loss control
If user user interface feel control situation becomes uneasy situation incongruent goal user would need exert control remedy user may even feel anxious threatened
Participants emphasized calm centered balanced composition
Diagonal line considered apprehensive horizontal calming It noteworthy visual element related coping feeling control necessarily related actual control function system signify affordances nevertheless associated coping
This mean appraisal process integrates visual element complete experience user interface connection emotional experience detail interface may explicitly clear
Further exploration issue could example reveal shape line associated emotional coping whereas coping would connected different visual element
Confusion connected color participant response
Confusion related control situation therefore closely related frustration apprehension
Avoiding confusion critical context interaction user interface necessary reveal inner logic software
Often user expectation concerning composition functionality user interface deviation norm confusing
However conventional design necessarily good design
The explication connection visual element emotional response confusion help formulation design principle
Boredom expressed relation spatial organization color background color
Boredom unpleasant feeling associated low effort decreased attentional activity
It distinguished emotion person feeling bored ignores happening often happens situation situation uninteresting nothing occupy stimulate subject
If composition user interface example judged interesting user may feel bored Pleasantness related user interface whole spatial organization centering content
As discussed appraisal two dimension satisfaction goal intrinsic pleasantness
Pleasantness associated former dimension reflects visual usability user interface relating possible use case latter dimension associated subjective aesthetic preference relating intrinsic pleasantness appraisal dimension In general negative emotion used frequently evaluating user interface
This observation explainable hedonic asymmetry mean adaptation pleasant emotion happens quickly adaptation unpleasant one
The participant therefore hastier report negative positive emotion
Although negative emotion salient participant appraisal also salient visual element elicited positive emotion
These restricted spatial organization element
Color contrast provoke positive emotion
In addition imbalance valence emotion higher activation arousal dimension frustration frequently expressed emotion lower activation boredom
It seems threshold expressing emotion higher activation lower expressing emotion lower activation
However unlike valance arousal dimension observed distributed unevenly different visual element
While salient visual element category associated emotion word dimension spatial organization clearly evoked emotion frequently expressed emotion also diverse
This understandable spatial organization umbrella term element constructing user interface composition visual element belonging spatial organization frequently observed content analysis salient visual element
Grouping similar content function reflected calming contributing grasping user interface whole understandability
Also appropriate amount negative space experienced calming
Both observation line narrative calmness especially understood help coping dimension appraisal listed visual element helped participant maintain overall control user interface reflected calmness
Imbalance asymmetry experienced frustrating
On contrary balance symmetry connected pleasantness
In addition centering content considered pleasant
As visual element diagonal line emphasized general relation emotion evoked
Diagonal line seen important constructing element overall impression layout
However emotion attributed diagonal line controversial
They experienced frustrating apprehensive also contributing elegant impression dynamic tension
Color contrast discussed frequently seldom connected emotion
When color contrast discussed relation emotion connotation negative frustration confusion boredom
This explicable color essential role among visual element
Color considered primary visual element evoking aesthetic preference strongly influencing legibility content understandability
The focus study future programmer engineer appraisal salient visual element
The result study indicate visual element considered salient one web page design contribute communicability visual usability kind emotion elicit attributed
The appraisal process integrates salient visual element emotional experience
This result positioning viewer user experience user interface explained term subjective relevance user interface appraised
This connects salient visual element pleasantness unpleasantness experience well well user able cope interaction
Spatial organization color contrast element based diagonal line color contrast essential user web page design promote fluent interaction visual usability
Characteristics line important role emphasizing visual usability interaction user interface
Spatial organization grouping similar content function appropriate use negative space balance symmetry contribute overall impression user interface clear understandable totality
Contrast figure text background enhances visual usability interaction user interface
In addition contrast user interface designed communicate content effortless manner grasping content one glance
Communicability user interface also refers content suitability relation context
Without contrast visual element user interface could communicate content user interacting
This notion emphasizes essence visual element contributing fluent interaction
User interface ability position viewer visual element emotion elicited essential interacting different user interface
The emotional response user interface analyzed relational theme created appraisal dimension
Connecting theme salient visual element created coherent narrative process emotional experience occurs response visual element web page design
Using framework future study focus detailing preliminary finding made
For example typical emotion encountered interaction observed connection salient visual element theme emotion different
These finding critical design set certain experience design goal operationalizes concept explanation connect designable element user emotion
Overall emotional emphasis centered symmetrical balanced composition experienced pleasant calming
Diagonal line received controversial emotional expression frustrating salient visual element also element creates subtle dynamic tension
According result stated goal design programmer perspective pleasurable controllable experience overall composition need provide impression static balance symmetry grouping centering content appropriate use negative space
This finding emphasizes attaining feeling control another important design goal attained focusing element
Designing contrasting color diagonal line need considered relation content user interface designed communicate

Social construction human created idea object event created series choice interaction
These interaction consequence change perception different group people construct
Some example social construction include class race money citizenship
The following also alludes notion everything set circumstance result could potentially one way
According article What Social Construction
Laura Flores Social construction work critical status quo
Social constructionists X tend hold Very often go urge In past viewpoint widely regarded fact called question due introduction new knowledge
Such viewpoint include past concept correlation intelligence nature human ethnicity race X may
An example evolution interaction various social construction within science technology found development bicycle
The velocipede widely used latter half century
In latter half century social need first recognized efficient rapid mean transportation
Consequently velocipede first developed able reach higher translational velocity smaller bicycle day replacing front wheel larger radius wheel
One notable certain decreased stability leading greater risk falling
This resulted many rider getting accident losing balance riding bicycle thrown handle bar
The first social construction progress velocipede caused need newer social construction recognized developed safer bicycle design
Consequently velocipede developed commonly known fit within society newer social construction newer standard higher vehicle safety
Thus popularity modern geared bicycle design came response first social construction original need greater speed caused bicycle designed first place
The popularity modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended widespread use velocipede eventually found best accomplish greater speed greater safety

reform democracy mandate discussion debate popular topic affect society
Deliberative Democracy tool making decision
Deliberative Democracy traced back way
More recently term coined Joseph Bessette work us idea opposition elitist interpretation emphasis public discussion
Deliberative Democracy lead legitimate credible trustworthy outcome
Deliberative Democracy allows wider range public knowledge argued lead socially intelligent robust science
One major shortcoming deliberative democracy many model insufficiently ensure critical interaction
According Ryfe five mechanism stand critical successful design deliberative democracy Recently movement towards greater transparency field policy technology
Jasanoff come conclusion longer question need increased public participation making decision science technology need way make meaningful conversation public developing technology
Ackerman Fishkin offer example reform paper Deliberation Day
The deliberation enhance public understanding popular complex controversial issue device Fishkin Deliberative Polling
Although implementation reform unlikely large government situation United States Federal Government
However thing similar implemented small local government like New England town village
New England town hall meeting good example deliberative democracy realistic setting
An ideal Deliberative Democracy balance voice influence participant
While main aim reach consensus deliberative democracy encourage voice opposing viewpoint concern due uncertainty question assumption made participant
It take time ensure participating understand topic debate
Independent manager debate also substantial grasp concept discussed must remain independent impartial outcome process
In coined phrase Tragedy common
It economic theory rational people act best interest group consuming common resource
Since tragedy common used symbolize degradation environment whenever many individual use common resource
Although Garrett Hardin STS scholar concept tragedy common still applies science technology society
In contemporary setting Internet act example tragedy common exploitation digital resource private information
Data internet password stolen much easily physical document
Virtual spying almost free compared cost physical spying
Additionally seen example tragedy common STS context
The movement net neutrality argues Internet resource dominated one particular group specifically money spend Internet access
A counterexample tragedy common offered Andrew Kahrl
Privatization normally healthy way deal tragedy common
Kahrl suggests privatization beach Long Island attempt combat overuse Long Island beach made resident Long Island susceptible flood damage Hurricane Sandy
The privatization beach took away protection offered natural landscape
Tidal land offer natural protection drained developed
This attempt combat tragedy common privatization
Privatization actually destroyed public good natural protection landscape
conceptual tool conventionally used represent state present western society
Modernity represents political social structure society sum interpersonal discourse ultimately snapshot society direction point time
Unfortunately conventional modernity incapable modeling alternative direction growth within society
Also concept ineffective analyzing similar unique modern society found diverse culture developing world
Problems summarized two element inward failure analyze growth potential given society outward failure model different culture social structure predict growth potential
Previously modernity carried connotation current state modern evolution European colonialism
The process becoming modern believed occur linear way seen Philip Brey way interpret evaluate social cultural formation
This thought tie thought society progress modern society
Within field science technology two main lens view modernity
The first way society quantify want move towards
In effect discus notion alternative modernity described Andrew Feenberg would like move towards
Alternatively modernity used analyze difference interaction culture individual
From perspective alternative modernity exist simultaneously based differing cultural societal expectation society individual within society function
Because different type interaction across different culture culture different modernity
Pace Innovation speed technological innovation advancement occurring apparent instance slow rapid
Both rate innovation extreme therefore effect people get use technology
No innovation without representation democratic ideal ensuring everyone involved get chance represented fairly technological development
The privileged position business science refer unique authority person area hold economic political technosocial affair
Businesses strong ability function society essentially choosing technological innovation develop
Scientists technologist valuable knowledge ability pursue technological innovation want
They proceed largely without public scrutiny consent potentially affected discovery creation
Legacy thinking defined inherited method thinking imposed external source without objection individual due fact already widely accepted society
Legacy thinking impair ability drive technology betterment society blinding people innovation fit accepted model society work
By accepting idea without questioning people often see solution contradict accepted idea impossible impractical
Legacy thinking tends advantage wealthy mean project idea public
It may used wealthy vehicle drive technology favor rather greater good
Examining role citizen participation representation politics provides excellent example legacy thinking society
The belief one spend money freely gain influence popularized leading public acceptance corporate
As result role politics cemented public exercise power ensured Constitution fullest extent
This become barrier political progress corporation capital spend potential wield great influence policy
Legacy thinking however keep population acting change despite poll Harris Interactive report Americans feel big business hold much power government
Therefore Americans beginning try steer away line thought rejecting legacy thinking demanding le corporate public participation political decision making
Additionally examination function separate example legacy thinking
Starting internet always viewed private luxury good
Internet today vital part society member
They use life every day
Corporations able mislabel greatly overcharge internet resource
Since American public dependent upon internet little
Legacy thinking kept pattern track despite growing movement arguing internet considered utility
Legacy thinking prevents progress widely accepted others u advertising internet luxury utility
Due pressure grassroots movement FCC redefined requirement broadband internet general utility
Now AT T major internet provider lobbying action able delay onset movement due legacy thinking grip American culture politics
For example overcome barrier legacy thinking may consider issue
This partially due fact access water become given fact matter
For person living circumstance may widely accepted concern drinking water needed concerned past
Additionally person living within area need worry water supply sanitation water supply le likely concerned privatization water
This notion examined thought experiment
Legacy thinking cause people particularly ignorant implication behind get pay mentality applied life necessity
By utilizing veil ignorance one overcome barrier legacy thinking requires person imagine unaware circumstance allowing free externally imposed thought widely accepted idea

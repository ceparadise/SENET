concept
Two early important example The term architecture computer literature traced work Lyle Johnson Mohammad Usman Khan member Machine Organization department IBM main research center
Johnson opportunity write proprietary research communication time known Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
To describe level detail discussing luxuriously embellished computer noted description format instruction type hardware parameter speed enhancement level system architecture term seemed useful machine Subsequently Brooks Stretch designer started Chapter book Planning Computer System Project Stretch ed
Buchholz writing Computer architecture like architecture art determining need user structure designing meet need effectively possible within economic technological constraint
Brooks went help develop called line computer architecture became noun defining user need know
Later computer user came use term many way
The earliest computer architecture designed paper directly built final hardware form
Later computer architecture prototype physically built form TTL prototype tweaked committing final hardware form
As new computer architecture typically built tested computer architecture inside FPGA committing final hardware form
The discipline computer architecture three main subcategories There type computer architecture
The following type used bigger company like Intel count computer architecture The purpose design computer maximizes performance keeping power consumption check cost low relative amount expected performance also reliable
For many aspect considered includes instruction set design functional organization logic design implementation
The implementation involves integrated circuit design packaging power cooling
Optimization design requires familiarity compiler operating system logic design packaging
An instruction set architecture ISA interface computer software hardware also viewed programmer view machine
Computers understand Java programming language used
A processor understands instruction encoded numerical fashion usually
Software tool translate high level language instruction processor understand
Besides instruction ISA defines item computer available
memory
Instructions locate available item register index name memory addressing mode
The ISA computer usually described small instruction manual describes instruction encoded
Also may define short vaguely mnemonic name instruction
The name recognized software development tool called
An assembler computer program translates form ISA form
also widely available usually software program isolate correct malfunction binary computer program
ISAs vary quality completeness
A good ISA compromise programmer convenience easy code understand size code much code required specific action cost computer interpret instruction complexity mean space needed disassemble instruction speed computer larger disassemblers come longer disassemble time
For example ISAs like ISA subtracts one value value zero value return higher value inexpensive fast however ISAs like convenient helpful looking size ISA
Memory organization defines instruction interact memory memory interacts
During design software emulator run program written proposed instruction set
Modern emulator measure size cost speed determine particular ISA meeting goal
Computer organization help optimize product
For example software engineer need know processing power processor
They may need optimize software order gain performance lowest price
This require quite detailed analysis computer organization
For example SD card designer might need arrange card data processed fastest possible way
Computer organization also help plan selection processor particular project
Multimedia project may need rapid data access virtual machine may need fast interrupt
Sometimes certain task need additional component well
For example computer capable running virtual machine need hardware memory different virtual computer kept separated
Computer organization feature also affect power consumption processor cost
Once instruction set designed practical machine must developed
This design process called
Implementation usually considered architectural design rather hardware
Implementation broken several step For entire implementation process organized differently often referred
The exact form computer system depends constraint goal
Computer architecture usually trade standard power versus performance cost memory capacity latency amount time take information one node travel source throughput
Sometimes consideration feature size weight reliability expandability also factor
The common scheme depth power analysis figure keep power consumption low maintaining adequate performance
Modern computer performance often described IPC instruction per
This measure efficiency architecture clock frequency
Since faster rate make faster computer useful measurement
Older computer IPC count low
Simple modern processor easily reach near processor may reach three five IPC executing several instruction per clock cycle
Counting machine language instruction would misleading varying amount work different ISAs
The instruction standard measurement count ISA actual machine language instruction unit measurement usually based speed computer architecture
Many people used measure computer speed clock rate usually MHz GHz
This refers cycle per second main clock CPU
However metric somewhat misleading machine higher clock rate may necessarily greater performance
As result manufacturer moved away clock speed measure performance
Other factor influence speed mix speed available memory type order instruction program
There two main type speed latency throughput
Latency time start process completion
Throughput amount work done per unit time
guaranteed maximum response time system electronic event like disk drive finish moving data
Performance affected wide range design choice example processor usually make latency worse make throughput better
Computers control machinery usually need low interrupt latency
These computer operate environment fail operation completed specified amount time
For example brake must begin braking within predictable short time brake pedal sensed else failure brake occur
take factor account measuring time computer take run series test program
Although benchmarking show strength choose computer
Often measured machine split different measure
For example one system might handle scientific application quickly another might render video game smoothly
Furthermore designer may target add special feature product hardware software permit specific benchmark execute quickly offer similar advantage general task
Power efficiency another important measurement modern computer
A higher power efficiency often traded lower speed higher cost
The typical measurement referring power consumption computer architecture million instruction per second per watt
Modern circuit le power required per transistor number transistor per chip grows
This transistor put new chip requires power supply requires new pathway built power
However number transistor per chip starting increase slower rate
Therefore power efficiency starting become important important fitting transistor single chip
Recent processor design shown emphasis put focus power efficiency rather cramming many transistor single chip possible
In world embedded computer power efficiency long important goal next throughput latency
Increases publicly released refresh rate grown slowly past year respect vast leap power consumption reduction miniaturization demand
This led new demand longer battery life reduction size due mobile technology produced greater rate
This change focus greater refresh rate power consumption miniaturization shown significant reduction power consumption much reported Intel release dropped power consumption benchmark watt watt
Comparing processing speed increase GHz GHz seen focus research development shifting away refresh rate moving towards consuming le power taking le space

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

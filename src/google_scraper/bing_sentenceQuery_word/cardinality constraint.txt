In Depth Tutorials Information understanding structuring describing real universe discourse UD definition schema using abstraction process data model
Traditionally three phase identified database design conceptual logical physical design
The conceptual modelling phase represents abstract level since independent database management system DBMS consequently close user allows collect almost completely semantics real world modelled
independent data formalism used play two main role conceptual design phase semantic role user requirement gathered together entity relationship UD documented representational role provides framework allows mapping logical design database development
Three topic involved database conceptual modelling process data modelling formalism methodological approach CASE tool support
One extended data modelling formalism extended entity relationship EER model proved precise comprehensive tool representing data requirement information system development mainly due adequate degree abstraction construct includes
Although original ER model proposed Chen many extension variation well different diagrammatic style defined Hull King McAllister Peckhan Maryanski
one difficult concept modelled relationship concept especially higher order relationship well associated cardinality
Some text topic Boman et Ullman Widom assume conceptual design addressed considering binary relationship since aim create model
We understand advantage approach although believe may produce certain loss semantics bias introduced user requirement force represent information rather artificial sometimes unnatural way
transformation process conceptual schema relational schema performed trying preserve semantics included conceptual schema completely final objective keep semantics database application access database
Nevertheless sometimes certain loss semantics produced instance foreign key null option relational model sufficient control relationship cardinality constraint
Central concept ER conceptual model entity relationship construct introduced Chen incorporated conceptual model although different name class type forth entity association relationship
Nevertheless concept precise semantics consequently necessary fix meaning
agreement one definition instance Thalheim collect different entity denotation
Although expert able give unique definition underlying concept coincidental usage design element suppose great disadvantage
An entity definition given highlight according Thalheim entity representation abstraction modeling purpose
Date add represented concept distinguishable object consider feature essential depends designer point view
This definition offer many interpretation instance several design method difference depending number relation participate relationship HERM Thalheim mean association entity UML OMG grouping cluster set entity relationship Teorey
These difference occur relationship combine association feature representation feature therefore might considered relationship association aspect highlighted entity representation aspect emphasized
general conceptual schema
Its functionality limit number entity occurrence associated relationship
Even though simple concept definition constraint admits several variant
Chen constraint extension mapping constraint special case cardinality constraint considers maximum cardinality binary relationship canbe N N M Chen Chen constraint adopted extended different data model methodology
On side MERISE approach Tardieu Rochfeld Coletti incorporates participation semantics
These two approach meet cardinality constraint binary relationship defined excepting natural difference graphical notation
Both represent semantics binary relationship although way expressing different
Table summarises semantics associated cardinality constraint occurrence A binary relationship two approach Chen Merise previously commented represent semantics
Table summarises semantics associated cardinality constraint A relationship R depending approach
Generally achieve complete mapping model keeping inherent semantic restriction conceptual model relational model quite complicated
Usually restriction applied relational model must reflected application different way outside DBMS
In way several extension relational model proposed Codd Codd Date Teorey provide semantic model
rule reflect cardinality constraint transformation
In general rule classified binary relationship transformation depending relation number generated Table
Option make relation constructor therefore R relationship transformed relation
Option us key propagation applied relationship mapping constraint N
Last Option considers one relation store information A B R constructor
This option restrictive others applied relationship mapping constraint
Table explains different option explained Table used depending cardinality constraint max
min
associated entity A B summarizes main transformation rule indicated option relational constraint must included add semantics
Relational constraint considered primary key PK unique key UK foreign key reference relation X optional attribute N
As see Table case minimum cardinality three first row table considered associated semantics lost transformation
When transform relationship must take account cardinality constraint approach used conceptual model whether relationship decomposed minor grade relationship study cardinality constraint validation needed
The relationship decomposition cardinality constraint validation study complex task need interaction domain expert solved
Therefore transformation rule whole presented easy rule
An example different transformation rule Merise Chen approach ternary relationship presented Table
As shown table rule depend mapping constraint
principal transformation rule ternary relationship adopted design methodology appear independent minimum cardinality constraint
This situation appears also higher relationship
Therefore summarize cardinality constraint one important restriction established relationship general semantics associated loss transformation process relational model
needed achieve conceptual model tool able reflect situation frequently appear data modelling scenario required
The redefinition conceptual model taking account previous aspect well development wider notation task dealt
The detection specification abstraction UD lead correct complete schema critical problem combine psychological methodological aspect
There many aspect associated specification constraint
Their identification validation require formal treatment
Identification faced lexical analysis problem description
Syntactic semantic validation relationship critical aspect internal coherence UD
To obtain property important clarify relationship definition define formally relationship cardinality constraint consider two main approach unification higher order relationship classify several approach provide conceptual model mapping provide set rule validate relationship
another problem preserve cardinality constraint semantics relationship implementation DBMS
There approach example Balaban Shoval extension extended entity relationship EER model made including method control semantics associated Chen cardinality
This approach add dynamic component model database management system support
Camps make complete analysis transformation maximum cardinality constraint relational model considering Chen Merise cardinality ternary relationship
They use equivalencies cardinality constraint functional dependency work concern transformation minimum cardinality problem
Finally Cuadra et al
present transformation EER schema relational schema using extended relational model active capability giving solution problem
Nevertheless understanding use construct constraint presented model easy task sometimes cause loss motivation
Disagreements main conceptual model confusion use construct open problem model shown
Some solution presented order clarify relationship construct extend cardinality constraint concept well several approach preserve cardinality constraint semantics relationship
One constraint established relationship
It limit number entity occurrence associated relationship
One way calculate cardinality constraint
It limit participation combination entity y entity relationship
Tools achieve good design information system
These tool used express information system requirement specification principal characteristic easy intuitive use
The basic element conceptual model represents abstraction modelling purpose
In design methodology tool transform conceptual schema schema near implementation
A well known principal model relational model
Another way calculate cardinality constraint
It limit participation entity relationship
The basic element one conceptual model
It defined association among entity
Property collect UD specification preserved transformation schema methodology phase

submitted GCC I trying wrap mind around GCC
I understand counting constraint I understand configured count
Any time I Google GCC I get bombarded overwhelming amount mathematese I ca wrap tiny programmer brain around anyone would willing break GCC baby step I find way applying problem I working I much obliged
Addendum The GCC constraint I looking much wiser fluent mathematician told much unable spin term I understand
Sorry wrong subreddit seems appropriate CSP problem
Post comment
An example might help
There entire class optimisation problem begin
These programming problem rather math problem supply expenditure resource allocation constraint nature
It seems GCC simply type constraint appears problem sport scheduling problem team play every team exactly season
No team play two match time
Each team play particular stadium twice season
For set match played stadium global cardinality constraint could used ensure two occurrence team
Rather basic linear programming constraint particular ship carry certain weight additionally counting cardinality constraint
Here paper survey algorithm optimization used constraint solver implement EGGC extended global cardinality constraint may overshoot undershoot aiming perhaps even altogether orthogonal ymmv
EDIT forgot add earlier Sorry I back work I rushing
I two problem GCC suggested solution simplest There another problem related I need shared cardinality I like get one problem way first I start worrying complex issue
Presumably interested GCC also solve problem constraint known etc
If really literally want know definition I paraphrase link provided I know
A GCC constraint among chosen set variable certain value taken exactly certain number time
For example say sort optimization problem variable u v w x z GCC might say Among variable w x z must exactly value exactly value
So proposed solution satisfy constraint something like since two variable among w x z value exactly one variable
For realistic example consider Sudoku expressed completely set GCC
You variable one square row column square GCC total constraint say row column square exactly one variable must exactly one variable must exactly one variable must

In database design fundamental principle one data aspect respect another critical feature
The relationship one must precise exact order explain aspect link together
In table related
This said given table relation another
For example consider database designed keep track hospital record
Such database could many table like In model A relationship mostly used split table two order provide information concisely make understandable
In hospital example relationship could used keep apart doctor unique professional information administrative detail
In collection data element grouped data table contain group data field name called database attribute
Tables linked key field
A primary key assigns field special order table
For example Doctor Last Name field might assigned primary key Doctor table people last name organized alphabetically according first three letter first name
A table also indicates field linked primary key another table
A complex data model involve hundred related table
A renowned computer scientist created systematic method decompose organize
Codd step organizing database table key called avoids certain hidden database design error
In real life process database normalization end breaking table larger number smaller table
In real world data modeling critical data grows voluminous table linked key must used speed programmed retrieval data
If data model poorly crafted even computer application system million record give unacceptable response time delay
For reason data modeling keystone skill needed modern software developer
The proposes technique produce diagram ERDs employed capture information data model entity type relationship cardinality
A show relationship
Alternatively single line represents relationship
In application programming paradigm decidedly marginal database structure design may used modeling subsequently mapped proper data modeling method
In case object relationship modeled using UML association multiplicity used association denote
Here example

If want pick solution S collection item C maximize function f S
The constraint pick k item k called cardinality constraint
If item C belongs different group allowed picked item group right terminology constraint
I think paper used call group cardinality constraint I sure still popular terminology
This clear question I going assume group disjoint

C every j
Then collection set S S C collection base
In context combinatorial optimization constraint S S often called
This special case matroid constraint
There example extensive body work maximizing submodular function f S subject matroid constraint
subject set S basis matroid
To clear I understand context I going first reproduce situation worded differently
Consider sequence set target function f
Let
We wish find subset C maximizes f S constraint k
I would agree commenter referred
I might also call structural constraint I would specifically avoid calling group carnality constraint group already meaning
In general I would advocate avoiding referring collection group set class unless object actually satisfies required axiom
Collection good general word mathematical meaning
If want use term carnality constraint always
This helpful allows highlight meaning constraint way general term
For example I paper constraint form I refer isolation condition S satisfies S isolated structure rest graph relevant way
This give simple intuitive way refer condition simultaneously telling reader important condition every time come

I currently introduction database concept I assignment question I ca answer
The Question asks sentence Degree Constraint mean
In relation database language
I ca really find material refers SQL specifically I ca decide mean constraint attribute entity perhaps constraint number relation entity something else entirely
Help would greatly appreciated
It another name cardinality constraint
Nor term
It way modifying standard cardinality
For example Many adjusted least adding ER diagram
The reference Ullman text A First Course Database Systems Pearson After lot reading I came across answer
Degree constraint far commonly called cardinality constraint
A constraint constraint occurrence relationship two entity
For example Many many One many

I learning database semester
The homework model really confuses
The homework drawing diagram vegetable market A Vegetable Market collection numbered stall
Each stall name unique sell least one kind vegetable kind name
Each stall sell vegetable particular price
Each farm grows vegetable vegetable must grown least one farm
Each farm one name unique address
Each stall buy vegetable one farm particular price agreed
My question describe constraint least one requirement
Another question since vegetable primary key discriminator treated entity
Or treated somethings else like attribute
Here answer As far I know impossible place ERD diagram information like I would simply mark relationship possible
The thing come mind placing appropriate comment stating requirement
Ad
Yes opinion represented separated entity
If wanted place attribute coud attribute entity able preserve uniqueness key anywas finally worst thing would
My proposition diagram unfortunatelly I tool support notation I know would possible Visio problem translating notation
The difference comparison I one relationship
Why
Because requirement Each stall buy vegetable one farm particular price agreed
My model preserve Stall sell vegetable bought also withing PK impossible Stall buy one vegetable different farm model allows

I using cvxpy work simple portfolio optimisation problem
The constraint I ca get head around cardinality constraint number portfolio holding
I tried two approach MIP approach traditional convex one
dummy code working traditional example
I idea use thought constraint smallest entry let target range k sum one I know I ca change direction inequality order stay convex maybe anyone know clever way constraining problem still keeping simple
My second idea make mixed integer problem along line looking binary vector seems right thing constraint work looking binary vector value I noticed small I assume mess thing
Anyone give guidance right way go
I use standard solver well Mosek help
I would prefer non MIP implementation I understand combinatorial problem get slow larger problem
Ultimately I would like either constraint exact number target holding range

Also documentation cvxpy around MIP short

I would like know status following question Given query access submodular function n R parameter n minimize f x subject cardinality constraint
I particular interested query complexity problem function n
Without cardinality constraint fortiori polynomial query complexity without monotonicity becomes I assume give little hope term number query
But monotonicity buy u anything
And throwing assumption n would help
I loss look answer pointer reference would welcome
end day I actually given query access f blackbox access randomized algorithm return
good additive approximation f x point x
I sure fundamentally change problem though case exact version seems like good place start
But approximate version considered literature would make day

In context database cardinality refers uniqueness data value contained column
High cardinality mean column contains large percentage totally unique value
Low cardinality mean column contains lot repeat data range
It common cardinality also sometimes refers relationship table
Cardinality table
High cardinality column unique uncommon data value
For example database table store bank account number Account Number column high cardinality definition every item data column totally unique
Normal cardinality column somewhat unique percentage data value
For instance table hold customer information Last Name column would normal cardinality
Not every last name unique example likely several occurrence Smith whole data fairly
Low cardinality column unique value
In customer table low cardinality column would Gender column
This column likely M F range value choose thousand million record table pick one two value column
Cardinality relationship table take form whose reversal
These term simply refer relationship data table
For example relationship Customers table Bank Accounts table one customer several account one account belong one customer
That course assuming bank never heard joint account

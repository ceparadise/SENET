Not inspirational perhaps get right school first try
I loved computer
I taught program high school thought I pretty good Apple Basic assembler time I graduated
I got job typesetting newspaper enrolled university part time taking programming class
I bad enough class I wound flunking enough time
Later I left paper enrolled University Washington
My grade good enough get made exception Alaskans WICHE program
I got poor grade dropped quarter
Still love computer programming intact even though nothing I school said I would good
Finally I went University Alaska Fairbanks
I got mixed grade flunking maybe half dozen course take several time
I stuck graduated
If I smart enough go campus recruiting I would gotten job point done
But I applied job could find one wound grad school despite poor grade grad school I could find would accept
I dropped grad school I lucky enough get job Microsoft
Nobody Microsoft cared grade
They care I graduated mostly show I could stick something
Nevermind I dropped twice dropping grad school come work
My career since pretty good
After first job Microsoft I never trouble finding work
It work history mattered employee education
Should worry poor grade
Sure think getting figure something need fix
In case lot liking class job
If aptitude learning problem computer science SHOULD learning entire career
You get good anything try hard enough
It matter applying
But decide think time spending whether better used elsewhere
If really like computer programming good sign computing good area
You need different counselor
You may also need different major possibly even time away school
It matter inspiration matter matched thing enjoy
College involve effort kind struggle describing
How high school
What class enjoy
If counselor dean student student life office make appointment right away go see one
Your academic advisor helping pick course sound like helping actually succeed
Good luck
I story I advice
Take one class per semester
Keep get two As row
Then take two class drop back one get anything le B
If get dual As two semester row ratchet
You might argue take longer
I would disagree
You student flunking taking class time
At rate never going get degree
If slow get degree eventually
One bit advice program newly time
It matter language
It matter competitive programming sending patch open source project
Just code
Six year graduate six year solid coding experience people degree none spending time taking class
Good luck
Still question

A blog
We dedicated giving every student every school opportunity learn computer programming
Not day go I read article speech need invest STEM education invest future student national competitiveness etc
Every time I hear STEM Science Technology Engineering Math I wish could focus conversation computer science
Why
Because three reason I explain See chart
Computer science STEM field job student
The data come government comparing job data projection Bureau Labor Statistics student data National Science Foundation
In chart computer science categorized alongside mathematics separated distinction would even greater favor CS
Now look computer science see field annual job growth almost rate student graduating bachelor degree
Computing job growing every state every industry
show job software computing company core driver recovery
And picture show fraction growth opportunity
Across field STEM computer science occupation top highest demand list lowest unemployment rate across field
Computer science impacting everything banking retail manufacturing entertainment across every industry country enough computer scientist fill open job
Google diversity gap workforce
Both tell similar story tech company hire men woman
For year author STEM problem talk fixing gender gap STEM addressing education pipeline student STEM field
If ask parent student STEM mostly know
By contrast far people familiar term like biology chemistry
I ran Meanwhile huge disconnect meaning STEM depending audience
When politician businessmen leader talk importance STEM mostly referring new stuff new technology innovation advancement invention driving growth national competitiveness
But STEM translated practice public education system translate topic already taught today school algebra geometry calculus biology chemistry physic
One hundred percent US public school teach math science
But percent NOT teach computer science encouraged teach STEM increase funding STEM turn course already teach
I run nonprofit called focused bringing computer science school offering free curriculum support school want add course option
The biggest obstacle work enough school district administrator feel need teach computer science
They need hear parent important
If high school parent ask school district offer computer science proper course alongside algebra biology chemistry
Don ask technology computer STEM even coding
Ask computer science

The goal project combine code developed method
The student also design nice user interface choice dynamical equation parameter method etc
Courses Probabilistic Model Checking Probability Computing Numerical Solution Differential Equations Prerequisites Some familiarity stochastic process working knowledge MATLAB C Contextuality fundamental feature quantum physical theory one distinguishes classical mechanic
In recent paper Abramsky Brandenburger categorical notion sheaf used formalize contextuality
This resulted generalizing extending contextuality theory share structural property quantum mechanic
A consequence type modeling succinct logical axiomatization property correlation result classical go theorem Bell
Like quantum mechanic natural language contextual feature subject much study distributional model meaning originated work Firth later advanced Schutze
These model based vector space semiring positive real inner product operation
The vector represent meaning word based context often appear inner product measure degree word synonymy
Despite success modeling word meaning vector space suffer two major shortcoming firstly immediately scale sentence secondly least intuitive way provide semantics logical word
Recent work group developed compositional distributional model meaning natural language lift vector space meaning phrase sentence
This already led promising experimental result
However approach deal well logical word
The goal project use sheaf theoretic model provide contextual logical semantics natural language
We believe sheaf provide generalization logical Montague semantics natural language well modeling logical connective account contextuality

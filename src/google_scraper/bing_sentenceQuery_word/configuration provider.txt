To manage System Center Configuration Manager use Configuration Manager console connects instance
By default SMS Provider installs site server install central administration site primary site
The SMS Provider Windows Management Instrumentation WMI provider assigns access Configuration Manager database site The security group provides access SMS Provider
Configuration Manager automatically creates group site server computer install instance SMS Provider
Secondary site support SMS Provider
Configuration Manager administrative user use SMS Provider access information stored database
To admins use Configuration Manager console Resource Explorer tool custom script
The SMS Provider interact Configuration Manager client
When Configuration Manager console connects site Configuration Manager console query WMI site server locate instance SMS Provider use
The SMS Provider help enforce Configuration Manager security
It return information administrative user running Configuration Manager console authorized view
Important When computer hold SMS Provider site offline Configuration Manager console connect site database
For information manage SMS Provider see
To support SMS Provider The computer must domain trust relationship site server site database site system
The computer site system role different site
The computer SMS Provider site
The computer must run operating system supported site server
The computer must least MB free disk space support Windows Automated Deployment Kit Windows ADK component installed SMS Provider
For information Windows ADK SMS Provider see topic
When install site automatically install first SMS Provider site
You specify following supported location SMS Provider The site server computer The site database computer A computer hold SMS Provider site system role different site To view location SMS Provider installed site select tab site dialog box
Each SMS Provider support simultaneous connection multiple request
The limitation connection number server connection available SMS Provider computer available resource SMS Provider computer service connection request
After site installed run Setup site server change location existing SMS Provider install additional SMS Providers site
You install one SMS Provider computer computer install SMS Provider one site
Use following identify advantage disadvantage installing SMS Provider supported location The SMS Provider use system resource site database computer
This location provide better performance SMS Provider located computer site server site database computer
The SMS Provider use site system resource site server
This location provide best performance three location sufficient server resource available
The SMS Provider us system network resource could dedicated site database operation
When site database hosted clustered instance SQL Server ca use location
SMS Provider use site server site database computer resource
This type location let deploy additional SMS Providers provide high availability connection
The SMS Provider performance might reduced due additional network activity required coordinate site server site database computer
This server must always accessible site database computer computer Configuration Manager console installed
This location use system resource would otherwise dedicated service
The SMS Provider operates independently display language computer installed
When administrative user Configuration Manager process request data using SMS Provider SMS Provider attempt return data format match operating system language requesting computer
The way attempt match language somewhat indirect
The SMS Provider translate information one language another
Instead data returned display Configuration Manager console display language data depends source object type storage
When data object stored database language available depend following Objects Configuration Manager creates stored database using support multiple language
The object stored using language configured site object created run Setup
These object displayed Configuration Manager console display language requesting computer language available object
If object displayed display language requesting computer displayed default language English
Objects administrative user creates stored database using language used create object
These object display Configuration Manager console language
They translated SMS Provider multiple language option
After site completes installation install additional SMS Providers site
To install additional SMS Providers run Configuration Manager Setup site server
Consider installing additional SMS Providers following true You many administrative user run Configuration Manager console connect site time
You use Configuration Manager SDK product might introduce frequent call SMS Provider
You want ensure high availability SMS Provider
When multiple SMS Providers installed site connection request made site randomly assigns new connection request use installed SMS Provider
You specify SMS Provider location use specific connection session
Note Consider advantage disadvantage SMS Provider location
Balance consideration information control SMS Provider used new connection
For example first connect Configuration Manager console site connection query WMI site server identify instance SMS Provider console use
This specific instance SMS Provider remains use Configuration Manager console Configuration Manager console session end
If session end SMS Provider computer becomes unavailable network reconnect Configuration Manager console site simply repeat task identifying instance SMS Provider connect
It possible assigned SMS Provider computer available
If occurs attempt reconnect Configuration Manager console available SMS Provider computer assigned
You use SMS Admins group provide administrative user access SMS Provider
The group automatically created site server site installs computer installs SMS Provider
Here additional information SMS Admins group When computer member server SMS Admins group created local group
When computer domain controller SMS Admins group created domain local group
When SMS Provider uninstalled computer SMS Admins group removed computer
Before user make successful connection SMS Provider user account must member SMS Admins group
Each administrative user configure Configuration Manager console automatically added SMS Admins group site server SMS Provider computer hierarchy
When delete administrative user Configuration Manager console user removed SMS Admins group site server SMS Provider computer hierarchy
After user make successful connection SMS Provider administration determines Configuration Manager resource user access manage
You view configure SMS Admins group right permission using WMI Control MMC
By default permission
After user connects SMS Provider user granted access data site database based administrative security right defined Configuration Manager console
The SMS Admins group explicitly granted permission namespace
Note Each administrative user us remote Configuration Manager console requires Remote Activation DCOM permission site server computer SMS Provider computer
Although grant right user group good idea grant SMS Admins group simplify administration
For information see section topic
The structure SMS Provider defined WMI schema
Schema namespaces describe location Configuration Manager data within SMS Provider schema
The following table contains common namespaces used SMS Provider
The computer install instance SMS Provider must required version Windows ADK version Configuration Manager using requires
For example version Configuration Manager requires Windows RTM version Windows ADK
For information requirement see
When manage operating system deployment Windows ADK allows SMS Provider complete various task View WIM file detail
Add driver file existing boot image
Create boot file
The Windows ADK installation require MB free disk space computer installs SMS Provider
This high disk space requirement necessary Configuration Manager install Windows PE boot image

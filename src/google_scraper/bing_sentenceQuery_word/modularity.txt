Modularity frequently used term information technology
Modularity refers concept making multiple first linking combining form complete system
Modularity enables minimizes duplication
In addition modularity also make easier fix problem bug traced specific system module thus limiting scope detailed error searching
extensively used concept based modularity
Modularity also feature
The figure show module puzzle form different shape placed different place
The module moved freely without affecting functionality module change system shape functionality

degree system component may separated recombined
The meaning word however vary somewhat context The term modularity widely used study technological organizational system
Product system deemed modular example decomposed number component may mixed matched variety configuration
The component able connect interact exchange resource energy data way adhering standardized interface
Unlike tightly integrated product whereby component designed work specifically often exclusively particular component tightly coupled system modular product system component In proposes five principle new medium understood absolute law rather general tendency culture undergoing The five principle numerical representation modularity automation variability transcoding
Modularity within new medium represents new medium composed several separate module act independently together synchronisation complete new medium object
In modularity evident layer single image composed many layer treated entirely independent separate entity
Websites defined modular structure formed format allows content changed removed edited whilst still retaining structure website

The entire Manovich note modular structure composed independent site page webpage composed element code independently modified
Organizational system said become increasingly modular begin substitute loosely coupled form tightly integrated hierarchical structure
For instance firm utilizes contract manufacturing rather manufacturing using organizational component independent building capability firm switch contract manufacturer perform different function contract manufacturer similarly work different firm
As firm given industry begin substitute loose coupling organizational component lie outside firm boundary activity conducted entire production system may encompass many firm becomes increasingly modular
The firm become specialized component
Using loosely coupled structure enables firm achieve greater flexibility scope scale
The firm switch easily different provider activity different contract manufacturer alliance partner compared building capability activity house thus responding different market need quickly
However flexibility gain come price
Therefore organization must ass flexibility gain achievable accompanying loss performance form
Modularization within firm lead disaggregation traditional form hierarchical governance
The firm decomposed relatively small autonomous organizational unit module reduce complexity
Modularization lead structure module integrate strongly interdependent task interdependency module weak
In connection dissemination modular organizational form facilitated widespread effort majority large firm refocus restructure
These effort usually involve strong complete process business split partial process handled autonomously team within organizational unit module
The module often carried using internal market mechanism particular implementation
Overall modularization enables flexible quicker reaction changing general market condition
Building principle many alternative form modularization firm possible
However crucial note modularization independent organizational concept rather consists several basic idea integral part organizational concept
These central idea found every firm
Accordingly sensible characterize firm modular modular firm always modular degree
Input system domain specific computational mechanism ability perceive spoken language termed vertical faculty according modular posse number characteristic Fodor argues constitute modularity
Fodor list feature characterizing module includes following Fodor argue formal definition inclusive list feature necessary modularity
He argues cognitive system characterized feature likely characterized system considered modular
He also note characteristic proposition rather characteristic may manifest degree modularity also dichotomous may le modular One would thus anyhow seems notion modularity ought admit degree Fodor
Notably Fodor assembled feature contrast sharply use modularity field modular system seen hierarchically nested module composed module turn composed module etc
However note Fodor commitment feature appears weak scholar Block proposed Fodor module could decomposed finer module
For instance Fodor distinguishes separate module spoken written language Block might decompose spoken language module module lexical form Decomposition stop component primitive operation primitive processor decomposed suboperations Though Fodor work modularity one extensive work psychology modularity worth noting symmetry modularity discipline
For instance Fodor focused cognitive input system module Coltheart proposes may many different kind cognitive module distinguishes example knowledge module processing module
The former body knowledge independent body knowledge latter mental system independent system
As discipline term modularity may used multiple way biology
For example may used refer organism indeterminate structure wherein module various complexity leaf twig may assembled without strict limit number placement
Many plant demonstrate type modularity contrast many organism determinate structure predefined
The term also used broader sense biology refer reuse across individual specie
Even within latter category may difference module perceived
For instance evolutionary biologist may focus module component subunit whole organism may use term module refer combination component able act unified way perform function
In former module perceived basic component latter emphasis module collective
Biology scholar provided list feature characterize module much Fodor
For instance Rudy Raff provides following list characteristic developmental module posse To Raff mind developmental module dynamic entity representing localized process morphogenetic field rather simply incipient structure organ rudiment
Bolker however attempt construct definitional list characteristic abstract thus suited multiple level study biology
She argues Another stream research modularity biology particular interest scholar discipline Lee Altenberg
Altenberg work Wagner work joint writing explores natural selection may resulted modular organism role modularity play evolution
Altenberg Wagner work suggests modularity result evolution facilitates idea share marked resemblance work modularity technological organizational domain
The use module fine art long pedigree among diverse culture
In antiquity module utilized standardized unit measurement proportioning element building
Typically module established diameter lower shaft classical column component syntax classical system expressed fraction multiple module
In traditional Japanese construction room size often determined combination standard rice mat called standard dimension mat around foot foot approximate overall proportion reclining human figure
The module thus becomes proportional device use vertical element planning tool well
Modularity mean measurement intrinsic certain type building example brick construction nature modular insofar fixed dimension brick necessarily yield dimension multiple original unit
Attaching brick one another form wall surface also reflects second definition modularity namely use standardized unit physically connect form larger composition
With advent modernism advanced construction technique century latter definition transforms modularity compositional attribute thematic concern right
A school develops among circle sculptor create sculpture architectural feature repetitive unit cast concrete
A decade later modularity becomes autonomous artistic concern several important artist adopt central theme
Modular building industrial production model object advanced architectural investigation develops period
Modularity found renewed interest among proponent form modular art constituent part physically reconfigured removed added
After isolated experiment ModulArt starting several artist since explored flexible customizable form art
In John Blair argues Americans began replace social structure inherited Europe predominantly England France evolved uniquely American tendency towards modularity field diverse education music architecture
Blair observes word first emerged sixteenth seventeenth century meant something close
It implied representation example
By eighteenth nineteenth century word come imply standard measure fixed ratio proportion
For example architecture proportion column could stated module height fourteen module equaled seven time diameter measured base thus multiplied size still retaining desired proportion
However America meaning usage word shifted considerably Starting architectural terminology new emphasis entity system designed term module subcomponents
As application broadened World War II furniture equipment computer program beyond modular construction came refer whole made unit designed equivalent part system hence might say systemically equivalent
Modular part implicitly interchangeable recombinable one another several sens Blair defines modular system one give importance part whole
Parts conceived equivalent hence one sens interchangeable cumulative recombinable pg

Blair describes emergence modular structure education college curriculum industry modular product assembly architecture skyscraper music blue jazz
In concluding chapter Blair commit firm view cause Americans pursue modular structure diverse domain appeared suggest may way related American ideology liberal individualism preference organization
Comparing use modularity across discipline reveals several theme One theme show psychology biology study innately specified
used implies purpose structure module predetermined biological mandate
module respond input specific class perform function specific class theme clearly span psychology biology argued also span technological organizational system
Domain specificity would seen latter discipline specialization function
theme recurs discipline
Though originally disavowed psychologist embraced readily apparent use modularity biology module organism decomposed finer module social process artifact think skyscraper term block floor single floor element floor etc
mathematics modulus may divided modulus technological organizational system organization may composed division composed team composed individual theme showed every discipline mathematics
Often referred autonomy theme acknowledged may interaction integration module greater interaction integration occurs within module
This theme closely related show explicitly psychology technology research
termed Simon show discipline manifest matter degree
For instance psychology biology may refer merely ability delineate one module another recognizing boundary module
In several social artifact mathematics technological organizational system however refers ability actually separate component one another
In several discipline decomposability also enables complexity system process reduced
This aptly captured quote psychological process note large computation split collection small nearly independent specialized subprocesses
Reducing complexity also express purpose mathematics
closely related construct
The former refers ability substitute one component another John Blair systemic equivalence latter may refer indeterminate form system indeterminate use component
In college curriculum example course designed credit system ensures uniform number contact hour approximately uniform educational content yielding substitutability
By virtue substitutability student may create curriculum recombinability curriculum system course may said recombinable variety student curriculum recombinability component within multiple system
Both substitutability recombinability immediately recognizable Blair social process artifact also well captured Garud Kumaraswamy discussion economy substitution technological system
Blair systemic equivalence also demonstrates relationship substitutability
Blair systemic equivalence refers ability multiple module perform approximately function within system biology module homologue refers different module sharing approximately form function different organism
The extreme module homologue found mathematics simplest case module refer reuse particular number thus module exactly alike
In mathematics emphasis module may different kind
In Fodor discussion modular cognitive system module performs unique task
In biology even module considered homologous may somewhat different form function whale fin versus human hand
In Blair book point jazz music may composed structural unit conform underlying rule component vary significantly
Similarly study technology organization modular system may composed module similar shelving unit may piled one atop different stereo system component performs unique function combination

In software engineering modularity refers extent application may divided smaller module
Software modularity indicates number application module capable serving specified business domain
Modularity successful developer use prewritten code save resource
Overall modularity provides greater software development manageability
Modern business issue grow continuous basis term size complexity demand
Enhanced software capability requirement force developer enhance developed system new functionality
Software engineering modularity allows typical application divided module well integration similar module help developer use prewritten code
Modules divided based functionality programmer involved functionality module
Thus new functionality may easily programmed separate module

Often module form DAG case cyclic dependency module seen indicating single module
In case module form DAG arranged hierarchy module independent depending module module depend one
A particular program library module hierarchy turn seen module program library system
When creating modular system instead creating monolithic application smallest component whole several smaller module written separately composed together construct executable application program
Typically also separately via linked
A may perform construction
This make modular designed system built correctly far reusable traditional monolithic design since many module may reused without change project
This also facilitates breaking project several smaller project

There two way constructing software design
One make simple obviously deficiency make complicated obvious deficiency
The first method far difficult
There natural hierarchy method evolved programmer manage level complexity

Next invented separated address space communicating process
Today routinely distribute program system across multiple host separated thousand mile network cable
The early developer Unix among pioneer software modularity
Before Rule Modularity theory engineering practice
In study economics modularity engineering design author use development computer industry case study argue Unix community fact first systematically apply modular decomposition production software opposed hardware
Modularity hardware course one foundation engineering since adoption standard screw thread late
The Rule Modularity bear amplification The way write complex software wo fall face build simple module connected interface problem local hope fixing optimizing part without breaking whole
The tradition careful modularity paying close attention issue like orthogonality compactness still much deeper bone among Unix programmer elsewhere
Early Unix programmer became good modularity
An OS one complicated piece code around
If well structured fall apart
There couple early failure building Unix scrapped
One blame early structureless C basically OS complicated write
We needed refinement tool like C structure good practice using like Rob Pike rule programming could tame complexity
Early Unix hacker struggled many way
In language function call expensive either call semantics complicated
Algol compiler optimizing thing like fast inner loop expense call time
Thus code tended written big lump
Ken several early Unix developer knew modularity good idea remembered reluctant write small function lest performance go hell
Dennis Ritchie encouraged modularity telling sundry function call really really cheap Everybody started writing small function modularizing
Years later found function call still expensive VAX code often spending time CALLS instruction
Dennis lied u
But late hooked All programmer today Unix native taught modularize subroutine level within program
Some learn art module level call good design
The movement making noble effort push level discover successful design abstraction applied organize structure program
Getting better kind problem partitioning worthy goal many excellent treatment available elsewhere

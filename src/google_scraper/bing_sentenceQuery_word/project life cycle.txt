Applying Project Life Cycle Introduction A project consists sequential phase purpose managerial control provide link ongoing operation attainment phase marked completion one milestone Gray
The life cycle project formally known project life cycle includes phase project development point inception final termination
These phase extremely useful planning project since provide framework budgeting manpower resource allocation scheduling project milestone project review
In report many reason purpose applying project life cycle model project development program made clear
Communications Plan One important aspect entire project life cycle effective communication
Time time assessment project team list communication needed area improvement
Many time troubled project project team member feel communication better project would run smoother
Effective communication allows everyone involved project stay project progress also facilitates ownership major project decision milestone
Information including expectation need goal resource status report budget purchase request need communicated regular basis major stakeholder order ensure success project
Communication midst project often made difficult due challenge unique project management
Many project require communication system established quickly short period time sometimes cost quantity quality detail
Another challenge effective communication sometimes nature project team sometimes even residing geographical location
In case unique delivery system must established order insure timely flow necessary information
One effective method improving flow information use communication table illustrated
As seen attached Communications Table column describes exactly information need communicated delivered
The next column Accountability list specific team member responsible ensuring communication occurs
The third column Objectives describes particular objective accomplished communication occurs
The fourth column Recipients describes person group receive intended information
All stakeholder affected project listed column project team project team member super visor senior management customer contractor vendor anyone vested interest successful development project outcome
The fifth final column Frequency describes often specific communication take place
A breakdown communication unacceptable reason project delay particularly little strategic planning use communication table example found previous page reduce completely eliminate likelihood breakdown communication ever occurring
Project Duration In order accurately determine duration project one must first gain full understanding process scheduled task assignment resource relevant phase assignment
Starting budget one attached one able gain understanding specific task material requirement well

Contributing Writer Once upon time software development consisted programmer writing code solve problem automate procedure
Nowadays system big complex team architect analyst programmer tester user must work together create million line code drive enterprise
More To manage number system development life cycle SDLC model created waterfall fountain spiral build fix rapid prototyping incremental synchronize stabilize
The oldest best known waterfall sequence stage output stage becomes input next
These stage characterized divided different way including following The waterfall model well understood useful
In Information Center Quarterly article Larry Runge say SDLC work well automating activity clerk accountant
It work nearly well building system knowledge worker people help desk expert trying solve problem executive trying lead company Fortune
Another problem waterfall model assumes role user specifying requirement requirement specified advance
Unfortunately requirement grow change throughout process beyond calling considerable feedback iterative consultation
Thus many SDLC model developed
The fountain model recognizes although activity ca start others need design start coding considerable overlap activity throughout development cycle
The spiral model emphasizes need go back reiterate earlier stage number time project progress
It actually series short waterfall cycle producing early prototype representing part entire project
This approach help demonstrate proof concept early cycle accurately reflects disorderly even chaotic evolution technology
Build fix crudest method
Write code keep modifying customer happy
Without planning risky
In rapid prototyping sometimes called rapid application development model initial emphasis creating prototype look act like desired product order test usefulness
The prototype essential part requirement determination phase may created using tool different used final product
Once prototype approved discarded real software written
The incremental model divide product build section project created tested separately
This approach likely find error user requirement quickly since user feedback solicited stage code tested sooner written
The synchronize stabilize method combine advantage spiral model technology overseeing managing source code
This method allows many team work efficiently parallel
This approach defined David Yoffie Harvard University Michael Cusumano MIT
They studied Microsoft developed Internet Explorer Netscape Communications developed Communicator finding common thread way two company worked
For example company nightly compilation called build entire project bringing together current component
They established release date expended considerable effort stabilize code released
The company alpha release internal testing one beta release usually wider testing outside company finally release candidate leading gold master released manufacturing
At point release specification would frozen remaining time spent fixing bug
Both Microsoft Netscape managed million line code specification changed evolved time
Design review strategy session frequent everything documented
Both company built contingency time schedule release deadline got close chose scale back product feature rather let milestone date slip

So I guessing new Computer Science curriculum coming little worried way ass student
At Uppingham Community College started developing way assessing student coming year
There many different subject plan covering
Some unit covering include Each subject map new curriculum different way
It decided create grid mapping progress time
Each student going marked following category based strength
A student working lower end Basic computing knowledge given level
Now I know government want get away using level framework still need way monitoring progress time
We mapped unit work fit object
Each student going list objective shown unit across year next name
This way able map progress unit shown grid
Now probably
earth I going ass student came
In order help u good idea student knowledge
We put together baseline test test student ability problem solve think logically
This help u sort idea type thinking
The idea split curriculum section
It allows u focus various level ability
If would like use assessment technique school test using
Feel free download
I hope useful overall
If query assessment please feel free drop email Here example plan breaking Python unit Good Luck September

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The Iterator property work clone underlying collection thus

As entrepreneur familiar phrase fail fast really mean
And put practice
In addition pivot done without abandoning everything starting
Failure take many form
It could feature could fit could business model choice cofounder hire whole idea first place
Fail fast apply category
Let break
Let start thing fail fast apply
If lot market research passionate idea start business best friend work time struggle get business ground mean fail fast shut business
Of course
Most world biggest business stumbled around finding right formula take
As CEO successful company told It took year become overnight Similarly building business thing going great get along CTO cofounder jettison find new person
Maybe building stressful invest time work relationship CTO
If hire another one problem soon enough
Fail fast big issue little one
It approach running company developing product embrace lot little experiment idea work grow others fail die
Not sure product require user give lot information starting use
One approach would talk lot people get different point view ass opinion decide schedule product roadmap develop test release
Or could get something work fail fast pivot try something else
Can decide target market group Fortune CEOs soccer mom
You could market analysis talk stakeholder conduct focus group going market
Or could try work fail fast pivot focus right group
Agonizing unproductive inside sale person hired
Give one chance
Give training coaching
Wait product mature remove customer objection
Maybe
Or could realize made bad hire fail fast pivot move
These example illustrate way business
It meta view approach
Develop culture experimentation willing try stuff quickly
But working willing fail fast pivot

There two type iterators Java
What mean difference
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
What difference Fail safe mean wo fail
Strictly speaking Java iterator
The correct term weakly consistent
The javadoc say Typically weak consistency mean collection modified concurrently iteration guarantee iteration see weaker
The detail specified conncurrent collection class javadocs
Fail fast mean fail failure condition checked aggressively failure condition possible detected damage done
In Java iterator fails throwing
The alternative weakly consistent semantic iteration fails unpredictably
sometimes give wrong answer throw totally unexpected exception
This behavior standard implementation API early version Java
different iterator use collection
No
These iterators implemented standard Collection type
either fail fast weakly consistent used correctly respect synchronization Java memory model
The iterators implemented using counter collection object
The implementation iterators typically
They typically rely property specific list implementation data structure
There general pattern
Read source code specific collection class interested
They rather type Iterators package throw collection modified collection method add remove iterating Iterators package typically iterate snapshot allow concurrent modification may reflect collection update iterator created
The difference iterator throw Exception contrary Iterator
If Collection modified structurally one thread iterating
This work clone Collection instead original collection called iterator
Iterator CopyOnWriteArrayList example Iterator also iterator written ConcurrentHashMap keySet also iterator never throw ConcurrentModificationException Java

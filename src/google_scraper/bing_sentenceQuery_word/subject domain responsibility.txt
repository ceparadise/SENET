A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Commitment ethical professional conduct expected every member voting member associate member student member Association Computing Machinery ACM
This Code consisting imperative formulated statement personal responsibility identifies element commitment
It contains many issue professional likely face
outline fundamental ethical consideration address additional specific consideration professional conduct
Statements pertain specifically individual leadership role whether workplace volunteer capacity organization like ACM
Principles involving compliance Code given
The Code shall supplemented set Guidelines provide explanation assist member dealing various issue contained Code
It expected Guidelines changed frequently Code
The Code supplemented Guidelines intended serve basis ethical decision making conduct professional work
Secondarily may serve basis judging merit formal complaint pertaining violation professional ethical standard
It noted although computing mentioned imperative Code concerned fundamental imperative apply one conduct computing professional
These imperative expressed general form emphasize ethical principle apply computer ethic derived general ethical principle
It understood word phrase code ethic subject varying interpretation ethical principle may conflict ethical principle specific situation
Questions related ethical conflict best answered thoughtful consideration fundamental principle rather reliance detailed regulation
This principle concerning quality life people affirms obligation protect fundamental human right respect diversity culture
An essential aim computing professional minimize negative consequence computing system including threat health safety
When designing implementing system computing professional must attempt ensure product effort used socially responsible way meet social need avoid harmful effect health welfare
In addition safe social environment human includes safe natural environment
Therefore computing professional design develop system must alert make others aware potential damage local global environment
Harm mean injury negative consequence undesirable loss information loss property property damage unwanted environmental impact
This principle prohibits use computing technology way result harm following user general public employee employer
Harmful action include intentional destruction modification file program leading serious loss resource unnecessary expenditure human resource time effort required purge system computer virus
action including accomplish assigned duty may lead harm unexpectedly
In event responsible person person obligated undo mitigate negative consequence much possible
One way avoid unintentional harm carefully consider potential impact affected decision made design implementation
To minimize possibility indirectly harming others computing professional must minimize malfunction following generally accepted standard system design testing
Furthermore often necessary ass social consequence system project likelihood serious harm others
If system feature misrepresented user coworkers supervisor individual computing professional responsible resulting injury
In work environment computing professional additional obligation report sign system danger might result serious personal social damage
If one superior act curtail mitigate danger may necessary blow whistle help correct problem reduce risk
However capricious misguided reporting violation harmful
Before reporting violation relevant aspect incident must thoroughly assessed
In particular assessment risk responsibility must credible
It suggested advice sought computing professional
See regarding thorough evaluation
Honesty essential component trust
Without trust organization function effectively
The honest computing professional make deliberately false deceptive claim system system design instead provide full disclosure pertinent system limitation problem
A computer professional duty honest qualification circumstance might lead conflict interest
Membership volunteer organization ACM may time place individual situation statement action could interpreted carrying weight larger group professional
An ACM member exercise care misrepresent ACM position policy ACM ACM unit
The value equality tolerance respect others principle equal justice govern imperative
Discrimination basis race sex religion age disability national origin factor explicit violation ACM policy tolerated
Inequities different group people may result use misuse information technology
In fair society individual would equal opportunity participate benefit use computer resource regardless race sex religion age disability national origin similar factor
However ideal justify unauthorized use computer resource provide adequate basis violation ethical imperative code
Violation copyright patent trade secret term license agreement prohibited law circumstance
Even software protected violation contrary professional behavior
Copies software made proper authorization
Unauthorized duplication material must condoned
Computing professional obligated protect integrity intellectual property
Specifically one must take credit idea work even case work explicitly protected copyright patent etc
Computing communication technology enables collection exchange personal information scale unprecedented history civilization
Thus increased potential violating privacy individual group
It responsibility professional maintain privacy integrity data describing individual
This includes taking precaution ensure accuracy data well protecting unauthorized access accidental disclosure inappropriate individual
Furthermore procedure must established allow individual review record correct inaccuracy
This imperative implies necessary amount personal information collected system retention disposal period information clearly defined enforced personal information gathered specific purpose used purpose without consent individual
These principle apply electronic communication including electronic mail prohibit procedure capture monitor electronic user data including message without permission user bona fide authorization related system operation maintenance
User data observed normal duty system operation maintenance must treated strictest confidentiality except case evidence violation law organizational regulation Code
In case nature content information must disclosed proper authority
The principle honesty extends issue confidentiality information whenever one made explicit promise honor confidentiality implicitly private information directly related performance one duty becomes available
The ethical concern respect obligation confidentiality employer client user unless discharged obligation requirement law principle Code
Excellence perhaps important obligation professional
The computing professional must strive achieve quality cognizant serious negative consequence may result poor quality system
Excellence depends individual take responsibility acquiring maintaining professional competence
A professional must participate setting standard appropriate level competence strive achieve standard
Upgrading technical knowledge competence achieved several way independent study attending seminar conference course involved professional organization
ACM member must obey existing local state province national international law unless compelling ethical basis
Policies procedure organization one participates must also obeyed
But compliance must balanced recognition sometimes existing law rule may immoral inappropriate therefore must challenged
Violation law regulation may ethical law rule inadequate moral basis conflict another law judged important
If one decides violate law rule viewed unethical reason one must fully accept responsibility one action consequence
Quality professional work especially computing profession depends professional reviewing critiquing
Whenever appropriate individual member seek utilize peer review well provide critical review work others
Computer professional must strive perceptive thorough objective evaluating recommending presenting system description alternative
Computer professional position special trust therefore special responsibility provide objective credible evaluation employer client user public
When providing evaluation professional must also identify relevant conflict interest stated
As noted discussion avoiding harm sign danger system must reported opportunity responsibility resolve
See guideline detail concerning harm including reporting professional violation
Honoring one commitment matter integrity honesty
For computer professional includes ensuring system element perform intended
Also one contract work another party one obligation keep party properly informed progress toward completing work
A computing professional responsibility request change assignment feel completed defined
Only serious consideration full disclosure risk concern employer client one accept assignment
The major underlying principle obligation accept personal accountability professional work
On occasion ethical principle may take greater priority
A judgment specific assignment performed may accepted
Having clearly identified one concern reason judgment failing procure change assignment one may yet obligated contract law proceed directed
The computing professional ethical judgment final guide deciding whether proceed
Regardless decision one must accept responsibility consequence
However performing assignment one judgment relieve professional responsibility negative consequence
Computing professional responsibility share technical knowledge public encouraging understanding computing including impact computer system limitation
This imperative implies obligation counter false view related computing
Theft destruction tangible electronic property prohibited Avoid harm others
Trespassing unauthorized use computer communication system addressed imperative
Trespassing includes accessing communication network computer system account file associated system without explicit authorization
Individuals organization right restrict access system long violate discrimination principle
No one enter use another computer system software data file without permission
One must always appropriate approval using system resource including communication port file space system peripheral computer time
This section draw extensively draft IFIP Code Ethics especially section organizational ethic international concern
The ethical obligation organization tend neglected code professional conduct perhaps code written perspective individual member
This dilemma addressed stating imperative perspective organizational leader
In context leader viewed organizational member leadership educational responsibility
These imperative generally may apply organization well leader
In context organization corporation government agency employer well volunteer professional organization
Because organization kind impact public must accept responsibility society
Organizational procedure attitude oriented toward quality welfare society reduce harm member public thereby serving public interest fulfilling social responsibility
Therefore organizational leader must encourage full participation meeting social responsibility well quality performance
Organizational leader responsible ensuring computer system enhance degrade quality working life
When implementing computer system organization must consider personal professional development physical safety human dignity worker
Appropriate ergonomic standard considered system design workplace
Because computer system become tool harm well benefit organization leadership responsibility clearly define appropriate inappropriate us organizational computing resource
While number scope rule minimal fully enforced established
Current system user potential user person whose life may affected system must need assessed incorporated statement requirement
System validation ensure compliance requirement
Designing implementing system deliberately inadvertently demean individual group ethically unacceptable
Computer professional decision making position verify system designed implemented protect personal privacy enhance personal dignity
This complement imperative public understanding
Educational opportunity essential facilitate optimal participation organizational member
Opportunities must available member help improve knowledge skill computing including course familiarize consequence limitation particular type particular professional must made aware danger building system around oversimplified model improbability anticipating designing every possible operating condition issue related complexity profession
The future computing profession depends technical ethical excellence
Not important ACM computing professional adhere principle expressed Code member encourage support adherence member
Adherence professional code ethic largely voluntary matter
However member follow code engaging gross misconduct membership ACM may terminated

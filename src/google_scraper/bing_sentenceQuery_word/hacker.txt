A someone seek breach defense weakness
Hackers may motivated multitude reason profit protest information gathering challenge recreation evaluate system weakness assist formulating defense potential hacker
The subculture evolved around hacker often referred computer underground
There longstanding term true meaning
In controversy term reclaimed argue refers simply someone advanced understanding computer computer network appropriate term break computer whether computer criminal computer security expert
A article concluded meaning still prevails among general public
In computer security hacker someone focus security mechanism computer network system
While including endeavor strengthen mechanism often used popular culture refer seek access despite security measure
That medium portrays villain
Nevertheless part subculture see aim correcting security problem use word positive sense
White hat name given ethical computer hacker utilize hacking helpful way
White hat becoming necessary part information security field
They operate code acknowledges breaking people computer bad discovering exploiting security mechanism breaking computer still interesting activity done ethically legally
Accordingly term bear strong connotation favorable pejorative depending context
The subculture around hacker termed network hacker subculture hacker scene computer underground
It initially developed context microcomputer
It implicated newsgroup
In article August issue commentary used term hacker title The Hacker Papers
It excerpt Stanford Bulletin Board discussion addictive nature computer use
In film Kevin Flynn describes intention break ENCOM computer system saying I little hacking
CLU us
By hacking sense breaking computer security already use computer jargon public awareness activity
However release film year featuring computer intrusion raised public belief computer security hacker especially teenager could threat national security
This concern became real year gang teenage hacker known broke computer system throughout including
The case quickly grew medium attention Neal Patrick emerged spokesman gang including cover story entitled Beware Hackers play Patrick photograph cover
The article appears first use word mainstream medium pejorative sense
Pressured medium coverage congressman called investigation began work new law computer hacking
Neal Patrick testified September danger computer hacking six bill concerning computer crime introduced House year
As result law computer criminality white hat black hat hacker try distinguish depending legality activity
These moral conflict expressed published
Use term hacker meaning computer criminal also advanced title Stalking Wily Hacker article May issue
Later year release provoked popular medium spread usage
The popularity Stoll book published one year later entrenched term public consciousness
Several subgroup computer underground different attitude use different term demarcate try exclude specific group agree
author advocate member computer underground called cracker
Yet people see hacker even try include view Raymond see wider hacker culture view Raymond harshly rejected
Instead dichotomy emphasize spectrum different category
In contrast Raymond usually reserve term malicious activity
According Ralph Clifford gain unauthorized access computer order commit another crime destroying information contained system
These subgroup may also defined legal status activity
A break security reason either test security system perform client working security company make security software
The term generally synonymous among others developed certification courseware class online training covering diverse arena ethical hacking
A black hat hacker hacker violates computer security little reason beyond maliciousness personal gain Moore
The term coined contrast maliciousness criminal hacker versus spirit playfulness exploration ethos performs hacking duty identify place repair mean legitimate employment
Black hat hacker form stereotypical illegal hacking group often portrayed popular culture epitome public fear computer criminal
A grey hat hacker lie black hat white hat hacker
A grey hat hacker may surf Internet hack computer system sole purpose notifying administrator system security defect example
They may offer correct defect fee
Grey hat hacker sometimes find defect system publish fact world instead group people
Even though grey hat hacker may necessarily perform hacking personal gain unauthorized access system considered illegal unethical
A among hacker used describe skilled
Newly discovered circulate among hacker
Elite conferred kind credibility member
A also known unskilled hacker break computer system using automated tool written others usually black hat hacker hence term script
prearranged plan set activity kiddie
kid individual lacking knowledge experience immature usually little understanding underlying concept
A neophyte noob someone new hacking phreaking almost knowledge experience working technology hacking
A hacker someone outside computer security consulting firm used system prior launch looking exploit closed
also us term represent series security briefing event
A hacktivist hacker utilizes technology publicize social ideological religious political message
divided two main group Intelligence agency operative nation state
Groups hacker carry organized criminal activity profit
A typical approach attack system In order several recurring tool trade technique used computer criminal security expert
A security exploit prepared application take advantage known weakness
Common example security exploit abuse security hole may result substandard programming practice
Other exploit would able used FTP HTTP Web page
These common Web site Web domain hacking
The computer underground produced specialized slang
Its member often advocate freedom information strongly opposing principle copyright well right free speech privacy
Writing software performing activity support view referred
Some consider illegal cracking ethically justified goal common form
The computer underground frequently compared Wild West
It common hacker use alias conceal identity
The computer underground supported regular gathering called hacker con
These event include Summer Christmas February AthCon Hacker Halted HOPE
Local Hackfest group organize compete develop skill send team prominent convention compete group pentesting exploit forensics larger scale
Hacker group became popular early providing access hacking information resource place learn member
Computer BBSs Utopias provided platform via modem
Hackers could also gain credibility affiliated elite group
Maximum imprisonment one year fine fourth category
commonly known prohibits unauthorized access damage protected computer
Protected computer defined The maximum imprisonment fine violation depends severity violation offender history violation
The notable print publication
While information contained hacker magazine often outdated time published enhanced contributor reputation documenting success
Hackers often show interest fictional literature movie
The adoption symbol value work common

transitive intransitive verb cut something using repeated blow cut chop something striking short repeated blow using sharp tool knife ax
As transitive verb mean cut way obstruction cut path way obstruction
undergrowth
It mean also chop something part cut shape divide something roughly carelessly
In computer science hack verb mean gain unauthorized access computer data use computer technological device system order gain unauthorized access data held another person organization transitive verb meaning cope something succeed endure something

Eric Raymond advocate member computer underground called cracker
Yet people see hacker even try include view Raymond see one wider hacker culture view harshly rejected Raymond
Instead hacker cracker dichotomy give emphasis spectrum different category white hat ethical hacking grey hat black hat script kiddie
In contrast Raymond usually reserve term cracker refer black hat hacker generally hacker unlawful intention
A white hat hacker break security reason instance testing security system
This type hacker enjoys learning working computer system consequently gain deeper understanding subject
Such people normally go use hacking skill legitimate way becoming security consultant
The word originally included people like although hacker may someone security
A grey hat hacker hacker ambiguous ethic borderline legality often frankly admitted
A black hat hacker someone break computer security without authorization us technology usually computer phone system network vandalism credit card fraud identity theft piracy type illegal activity
A script kiddie break computer system using automated tool written others usually little understanding
These outcast hacker community
A hacktivist hacker utilizes technology announce social ideological religious political message
In general hactivism involves website defacement attack
In extreme case hactivism used tool Cyberterrorism
A typical approach attack system
Network enumeration Discovering information intended target

Vulnerability analysis Identifying potential way attack

Exploitation Attempting compromise system employing vulnerability found vulnerability analysis
In order several recurring tool trade technique used computer criminal security expert
A security exploit prepared application take advantage known weakness
A common example security exploit fail programming attempt would allow SQL injection
Other exploit would able used FTP HTTP PHP SSH Telnet
These common hacking
A vulnerability scanner tool used quickly check computer network known weakness
Hackers also commonly use port scanner
These check see port specified computer open available access computer sometimes detect program service listening port version number
Note firewall defend computer intruder limiting access inbound outbound still circumvented
A packet sniffer application capture data packet used capture password data transit network
A spoofing attack involves one program system website successfully masquerading another falsifying data thereby treated trusted system user another program
The purpose usually fool program system user revealing confidential information user name password attacker
A rootkit designed conceal compromise computer security represent set program work subvert control operating system legitimate operator
Usually rootkit obscure installation attempt prevent removal subversion standard system security
Rootkits may include replacement system binary becomes impossible legitimate user detect presence intruder system looking process table
Social Engineering art getting person reveal sensitive information system
This usually done impersonating someone convincing people believe permission obtain information
A Trojan horse program seems one thing actually another
A trojan horse used set back door computer system intruder gain access later
The name refers horse Trojan War conceptually similar function deceiving defender bringing intruder inside
A virus program spread inserting copy executable code document
Thus computer virus behaves way similar biological virus spread inserting living cell
Like virus worm also program
A worm differs virus propagates computer network without user intervention
Unlike virus need attach existing program
Many people conflate term virus worm using describe program
A keylogger tool designed record every keystroke affected machine later retrieval
Its purpose usually allow user tool gain access confidential information typed affected machine user password private data
Often us method remain active hidden

Alfred Thompson blog teaching computer science level
Alfred high school computer science teacher year
He also taught grade computer specialist
What difference Hacking programming
One opinion I heard expressed hacker put lot code together hurry change needed code completely rewritten
A programmer may take little longer change needed quickly easily installed without need complete rewrite
One source I heard attributed observation like Maggie Johnson Google
It ring true though
Hacking usually described quick You though bunch code together make go along
Some hacker quite brilliant amazing thing incredibly short period time
And move next thing
Or perhaps stay thing one else understand well enough fix modify improve
Job security
Perhaps good thing people use importantly pay software
I little hacking say toss something together short period time without lot planning time time
I genius though typically end poorly
The performance poor maintainability poor one else want use
This may make biased way thing I guess
I prefer program think thing plan proceed organized fashion
I saw difference made clear first year teaching long time ago
I working little game programming decided show student
As I explained I set thing around number constant hoped would make program easily expandable one student turned another said Look
He starting already planning That one real key opinion real programming
I major Systems Analysis college
This time computer science major rare software engineering major rarer still
But one thing professor drilled head program maintainable extensible
We taught day one program finished sense abandoned
More likely point declare victory
But others maintain program expand adapt
Making life easier good thing
Think Golden Rule program would want programmer whose code modifying programmed
I think written
The hacker get lot attention day
These basketball player make slam dunk make highlight reel
But basketball game team player executing basic solid play well executed dribble layup pas get ball star
In long run need real programmer make solid dependable program rewritten scratch change needed
I think hacking great throwaway code proof concept
It great way learn intricacy problem serious attempt however hack code never leave machine
Imagine world civil engineer architect released building
Real programmer like release hack code
I ca fathom anyone could possibly proud bad code got done quickly
Nice article
I enjoyed take topic Definitely valid perspective
Some people hack together large PoC something effect short period time concept logical design
I example mused topic week writing idea without really focusing code class code flow diagram anything ilk
Then cranked line python day work expected
Not sure one fall though
Just John Romero famous incredibly fast code output game innovation
Great comment pretty much echo thought
I would also propose world although able produce something quick also cheapen whole product
Then business owner world say hey I get something good enough lot le dont need pay people much hire many
lot unintended consequence profession allowing hacker play real world long period time Hi This interesting
I like many difference hacking think real programmer like release hack code
like hacking willing learn hacking software
u willing tell

Version What hacker research taught Although academic industry practitioner regard hacking mostly loose collection useful trick essentially random nature I argue hacking fact become distinct research engineering discipline deep underlying engineering idea insight
Although yet formally defined idea insight drive great contribution hacking making understanding computing including challenge handling complexity composition security complex system
I argue hacking uncovers help understand teach fundamental issue go heart Computer Science know try formulate several fundamental principle I learned hacker research
At point I realized I learning really matter computer science hacker convention Phrack Uninformed hacker source academic source
Moreover exploit vulnerability system really designed opposed developer thought student taught
Then I realized reason vulnerability kept giving quite deeply theoretical involved theory computation information theory
Very little quoted understood academic publication
In talk I give retrospective hacker research I believe priority developing rediscovering important scientific idea define discipline information security
I also argue hacking become distinct engineering discipline special method principle
Hackers deal trust property software hardware system
Other discipline claim study property hacker approach radically different others focus like OSI networking model hacking essentially
In word hacker essentially invented security analysis focus trust assumption interaction layer composed system
It formalized academic standard delivers
In retrospect emergence engineering discipline analyzed trust effect prevaling practical method developing complex computer system composing mostly independently developed tested component expected
Such analysis sorely needed would arise even issue continually ignored recognized expert authority
As stand hacker research arose fill gap
Whereas regular developer layer implicitly trusted behave specified least described tutorial hacker focus layer actually interact data control actually flow layer
That rootkits like Phrack palmer similar best possible reading understand OS structure
I assign course
That session hijacking packet injection Black Ops Ptacek Newsham Kaminsky best understanding stack work show exactly data structure kept kernel present illusion session stateless IP controlled
Many best hack based interplay composition relatively secure part resulting new property make composed system insecure
To large extent Hacking research discipline study phenomenon I illustrate example network system
From theory standpoint system composition several sufficiently complex part general algorithm formal method deduce property composed system even property part known
This reduced Halting Problem equivalently Rice Theorem
I give example insecure system design based simple assumption compositional property actually verified algorithmic way result system remain badly broken despite effort fix
These system remain untrustworthy yielding security based undecidable problem amount programming solve
A prime example taken next level rigor major Len Sassaman Meredith Patterson announced year case certificate
It depends computation involved parsing certificate signing request signed certificate CA browser respectively equivalent yielding result
However design protocol make computationally impossible check equivalence certificate system keep giving
Mostly likely good enough solution unless intermediary class data structure involved defined
Another example thing NIDS traffic
The efficacy NIDS depends computation giving result NIDS target general also computationally impossible undecidable good enough solution either
Theory computation concern proving computing environment regular expression parse recursive structure attempted last example IE rewriting feature gave rise whole new kind exploit precisely inability
Designers developer base security system similar trust assumption system
The problem understand computation system capable
From early day hacking great history exposing extra computational power system demonstrating weird computation thought impossible
Hackers exposing unexpected weird machine actually contained traditional computing environment supported unexpected programming model exploit program
Exploit development discipline recognizing weird machine inherent target usually close writing code weird instruction set may include call library function system call reachable piece code app firmware
It programming platform within platform within platform
A prime example story developing code idea original exploit first published Solar Designer detailed technique explanation Phrack recent fully featured compiler kernel rootkits Hund Holz Freiling
The idea compiler however circulated hacker community since least I show
It took ten year academia recognize power idea got named Programming ROP
The idea exploit actual program right executing weird machine could contain native executable code thus instead looking malicious code one watch malicious computation term coined would impossible without hacker research
In short hacker research idea computation
I show classic idea building secure system DoD Rainbow series Tagged architecture long ignored commodity computing vendor like Intel hacker hardening patch OpenWall PaX grsecurity patch creative us segmentation system extra page table entry bit split TLB
I give historical perspective advance OpenWall ShadowWalker beyond
I argue hacker research hacker finally caused industry recognize value implement hardware NX protection introduce feature like DEP mainstream OS I indebted FX major part argument
It fact hacker particular vuln dev RE community leading producer debugger ever increasing power fact changed idea conventional debugger making environment
This research involved deeper understanding use hardware trapping including trap complex event page recently written user process used fetch instruction OllyBone
It opened new direction security policy mechanism reference monitor design academia industry I give example
I describe hacker research network deception trust relationship mapping network created methodology industry network security assessment

In one sense silly argue true meaning word
A word mean whatever people use mean
I Academie Française I ca force use word hacker according official definition
Still understanding etymological history word hacker may help understanding current social situation
The concept hacking entered computer culture Massachusetts Institute Technology
Popular opinion MIT posited two kind student tool hacker
A tool someone attends class regularly always found library class meeting get straight As
A hacker opposite someone never go class fact sleep day spends night pursuing recreational activity rather studying
There thought middle ground
What computer
Originally nothing
But standard success hacker grade form standard success tool
The true hacker ca sit around night must pursue hobby dedication flair
It telephone railroad model real science fiction fandom ham radio broadcast radio
It one
Or computer
In word hacker generally used among MIT student refer computer hacker building hacker people explore roof tunnel supposed
A computer hacker someone life breathes computer know computer get computer anything
Equally important though hacker attitude
Computer programming must something done fun sense duty money
It okay make money ca reason hacking
A hacker aesthete
There specialty within computer hacking
An algorithm hacker know best algorithm problem
A system hacker know designing maintaining operating system
And password hacker know find someone else password
That calling
Someone set crack security system financial gain hacker
It hacker ca thief hacker ca thief
A hacker must fundamentally amateur even though hacker get paid expertise
A password hacker whose primary interest learning system work therefore necessarily refrain stealing information service someone whose primary interest stealing hacker
It matter emphasis
Throughout history human race right wrong relatively easy concept
Each person born particular social role particular society situation part traditional meaning role
This social destiny backed authority church state
This simple view ethic destroyed year ago notably Immanuel Kant
Kant many way inventor Century
He rejected ethical force tradition created modern idea autonomy
Along radical idea introduced centrality rational thought glory obligation human being
There paradox Kant Each person make free autonomous choice unfettered outside authority yet person compelled demand rationality accept Kant ethical principle Categorical Imperative
This principle based idea ethical individual must generalizable everyone
Modern cognitive psychology based Kant idea
Central functioning mind people believe information processing rational argument
Even emotion many psychologist kind theorem based reasoning data
Kohlberg theory moral development interprets moral weakness cognitive weakness inability understand sophisticated moral reasoning rather failure
Disputed question ethic like abortion debated question fact subject rational proof
Since Kant many philosopher refined work many others disagreed
For purpose understanding hacker must consider one latter Sören Kierkegaard
A Christian hated established church Kierkegaard accepted Kant radical idea personal autonomy
But rejected Kant conclusion rational person necessarily compelled follow ethical principle
In book present dialogue two people
One accepts Kant ethical point view
The take aesthetic point view important life immediate experience
The choice ethical aesthetic choice good evil choice whether choose term good evil
At heart aesthetic way life Kierkegaard characterises attempt lose self immediacy present experience
The paradigm aesthetic expression romantic lover immersed passion
By contrast paradigm ethical marriage state commitment obligation time present bound past future
Each two way life informed different concept incompatible attitude rival premise
MacIntyre Kierkegaard point rational argument convince u follow ethical path
That decision radically free choice
He neutral want u choose ethical
But want u understand real choice make
The basis choice course Christian faith
see need religious conviction even world
But ethical choice also based secular humanist faith
A lesson history philosophy may seem place position paper computer scientist pragmatic problem
But Kierkegaard lived century electronic computer gave u profound understanding hacker
A hacker aesthete
The life true hacker episodic rather planned
Hackers create hack
A hack anything practical joke brilliant new computer program
VisiCalc great hack
Its imitator hack
But whatever good hack must aesthetically perfect
If joke must complete one
If decide turn someone dorm room enough epoxy furniture ceiling
You must also epoxy piece paper desk
Steven Levy book talk length call hacker ethic
This phrase misleading
What discovered Hacker Aesthetic standard art criticism hack
For example Richard Stallman say information given freely opinion based notion property theft right wrong would ethical position
His argument keeping information secret lead unaesthetic duplication effort
The original hacker mostly undergraduate late teen early twenty
The aesthetic viewpoint quite appropriate people age
An epic tale passionate love moving
A tale passionate love likely comic
To embrace aesthetic life embrace evil hacker need enemy society
They young immature protected sake well
In practical term problem providing moral education hacker problem moral education general
Real people wholly ethical wholly aesthetic shift one viewpoint another
They may recognize shift
That Levy say ethic talking aesthetic
Some task moral education raise young encourage developing ethical viewpoint point gently lovingly situation aesthetic impulse work ethical standard

Note This appendix position paper I wrote ACM Select Panel Hacking

The term used page sense circumventing computer security
There simple definition word intended good approximation might programmer whose target audience Section version CS
The section cover programing concept section CS different approach
The official title course like section CS section indeed cover programming
Section cover however title better capture intent course
Enroll section want course different challenging compared usual CS
That accelerated part
Enroll section particularly interested topic programming language operating system compiler C Unix
That part though show clearly course course set foundation
Section CS intended first part sequence companion section CS offered spring semester
Fall CS
Uses main programming language learning program design
Also us connects concept Racket Java le emphasis Java detail standard section CS us Java
Spring CS
Uses main programming language learning detail data structure well Racket Java standard section CS us Java
Enrolling section CS oblige student enroll companion CS section
Students finish section CS prepared standard section CS although may learn Java detail synchronize student main track
Books reference Java plentiful
Enrolling companion CS section without taken section CS recommended since course build concept terminology skill specific section CS
The section sequence based textbook
In space programming approach Racket considered
The instructor however belief approach also fundamentally course designed make connection clear
The section sequence also based instructor perspective implementing Racket language system ultimately requires
That perspective drive emphasis machine model algorithm CS part sequence
Putting piece together student section sequence learn implement language using language topic usually reserved course
At time concept required implementation serve many kind programming task well
If question section CS contact Matthew Flatt instructor

Learn something new every day email Computer practice modifying computer hardware software accomplish goal outside creator original purpose
People engage computer hacking activity often called
Since word hack long used describe someone incompetent profession hacker claim term offensive fails give appropriate recognition skill
Computer hacking common among teenager young adult although many older hacker well
Many hacker true technology buff enjoy learning computer work consider computer hacking art form
They often enjoy programming skill one particular program
For individual computer hacking real life application skill
It chance demonstrate ability opportunity harm others
Since large number hacker prodigy actually employ computer hacker part technical support staff
These individual use skill find flaw company security system repaired quickly
In many case type computer hacking help prevent serious crime
Computer hacking also lead constructive technological development since many skill developed hacking apply mainstream pursuit
For example former hacker Dennis Ritchie Ken Thompson went create UNIX
This system huge impact development Linux free operating system
Shawn Fanning creator Napster another well known accomplishment outside computer hacking
In comparison develop interest computer hacking simple intellectual curiosity hacker le noble motif
Hackers steal personal information change corporation financial data break security code gain unauthorized network access conduct destructive activity sometimes called This type computer hacking earn trip federal prison year
If interested protecting home computer malicious hacker investing good firewall highly recommended
It also good idea check update regular basis
For example Microsoft offer number free security patch Internet Explorer browser
I need program download every site password used imac
It cleaned pretty good
I admin user
Cracker offensive graduate high school
People right use word want
If directing get high horse
Also people general stupid understand computer logic
I talking fathom deep knowledge mind power need
People stupidity offends mostly blatant
The term cracker could taken offensive
I white taken offense
Really
Not hacker think
Many time reason computer fried yet
Like article say many company employ people hacker protect system finding flaw semantics whatever programming language database server intranet pick
Otherwise bank account drained hacker seen movie
This War Games
You must know computer stuff work know programming language least three four language must background read lot book create design test

All right coming real hacker
Hacking shown movie almost never realistic
I however seen realistic example
Computer hacking nothing virus
Viruses script kiddy basically mean noobs
Hacking illegal unless gasp
commit crime
There quite great many misconception computer hacker
First computer hacker legal without risk long following ethical guideline
There absolutely law preventing computer hacking
There however great many law preventing computer cracking
This using knowledge computer break secure network personal computer website bank etc
changing saving rerouting data money bit information
This extremely illegal could land hefty jail time federal prison
Hacking misconceived simply ability change hardware software original creator intended
changing window system If solve problem better original creator current solution often revered amongst computer hacker
Hacking simply using computer knowledge change original code hardware solve problem efficiently perhaps quicker
Often time company hire hacker hack system check weak point hacker tell fix
Hacking white hat operation legal
Cracking black hat operation illegal
There hacker believe breaking security ethical long take manipulate anything
These hacker called grey hat still illegal part
Nine computer programmer hacker one version another
Do cross bound cracking

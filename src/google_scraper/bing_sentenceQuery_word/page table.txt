A contiguous block described single entry
It smallest unit data memory management virtual memory
Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation
Starting processor support MiB page called MiB page using addition standard KiB page newer processor newer processor later processor use GiB page
support many eight different page size KiB MiB architecture similar feature
Larger page despite available processor used contemporary common use except application application typically found large server operating system
Commonly use requires elevated privilege cooperation application making large allocation usually setting flag ask operating system huge page manual administrator configuration operating system commonly sometimes design page disk
However support multiple page size
Each individual process provide hint operating system automatically use largest page size possible given region address space
supported huge page several architecture since series via filesystem without hugetlbfs since
newer support huge page name page
support large page internally expose application
beginning version support large page
FreeBSD feature superpages
Note recently Linux application needed modified order use huge page
The kernel introduced support transparent use huge page
On Linux kernel supporting transparent huge page well FreeBSD Solaris application take advantage huge page automatically without need modification

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Im studying I cant figure difference
A page chunk address
This map memory
This page big
But according litterature Page table entry around Bytes big
I thought Page Table Entry page
AFAIK page table entry contain page
Rather contains address physical memory chunk particular page table mapped
This address byte
In example page table entry contains address physical memory chunk frame
Knowing offset find actual address physical memory
Hope help

I understand difference page table inverted page table
I know used translate logical address physical address produced process necessary store data memory
This I know
Generally page table contains element virtual page table exists process
This lead huge table program many page
I imagine page table like Instead I know
It one page table process
This table entry real page block physical memory
Each element contains virtual address page stored physical location information process owns page
So I represent inverted page table like Am I right
Did I get right
Thank I understand information I learned theoretically I understood well
I think efficient interved page table normal page table indeed I find confusing
As I understand frame physical memory corresponding entry inverted page table
I suppose memory large number frame inverted page table huge I keep RAM
While use page table normal I keep memory time keep currently active process
And reversed arrow reversed I map logical address physical
An inverted page table
An inverted page table fit DRAM proportional size DRAM
If DRAM N page size byte inverted page table entry byte DRAM size N byte page table size N always memory
Your picture inverted page table correct
Here picture original paper inverted page table Huck Jerry Hays Jim Architectural Support Translation Table Management Large Address Space Machines Symp Comp Arch

It hash table
Each entry hash table need store virtual address physical address
The virtual address check hash conflict
The reason guarantee total number entry HPT hash page table plus collision resolution table N number physical page one entry table physical page

I answering problem related virtual memory would like help clarifying confirming understanding stuff done
The question follows Given system bit word virtual address space gigabyte physical address space gigabyte page size kilobyte
There assumption page table entry rounded byte
What size page table byte
b Now assume translation lookaside buffer implemented total address translation
Calculate size tag index field
My answer follows A The size page table equal number entry page table multiplied size entry
The number entry page table equal memory size divided page size
The size entry equal word size minus bit used number entry page table
Hence page table size bit bit byte However I found heading Page Table Size us basically identical number
Page Table Size virtual address space size page size page table entry size KB B MB Which answer correct
Next B I unsure calculate part I believe Tag calculated adding number block plus offset plus index
This way set associative block set
The index bit base index size bit decreased also way set associative
However I unaware calculate offset needed help calculate tag
Any help would much appreciated
For part made two error
First question specifically stated page table entry rounded byte
Second PTE contains bit needed determine address based address page aligned
In described system physical address bit GiB
Since system us page least significant bit physical address PTE would zero implicit
So physical address bit needed
Aside desirability rounding power two number byte PTEs include additional data valid bit modified bit accessed bit permission bit user supervisor mode even MiB physical address space KiB page bit needed indicate physical address one could use byte PTEs
It noted processor would use flat page table
For address hierarchical linear page table generally used
These introduce little extra space overhead full occupancy require multiple memory access find translation common case partial occupancy dense allocation use substantially le memory
This particularly significant since processor designed multiple address space OSes process page table
Using almost half physical memory MiB page table support process understandably unattractive
For part b correct set associative mean block set bit subtracted number bit needed indexing based number entry
However bit used indexing TLB
In data cache tag size would equal number address bit minus number index bit minus number offset bit within cache block
For TLB virtual address aligned size page least significant bit within page untranslated
For KiB page mean least significant bit ignored
With virtual address leaf bit
That bit used indexing already determined bit left
For TLB tag associated one translation
This would equivalent data cache block size byte offset bit
Therefore tag excluding Address Space ID would bit
In clustered TLB analogous sectored cache block two translation provided entry entry becomes le clear term could refer translation entry combination tag multiple translation associated tag
I suspect appreciate complexity part problem

A used system store mapping
Virtual address used program executed accessing physical address used hardware specifically subsystem
In operating system use virtual memory every process given impression working large contiguous section memory
Physically memory process may dispersed across different area physical memory may moved another storage typically hard disk drive
When process request access data memory responsibility operating system map virtual address provided process physical address actual memory data stored
The page table operating system store mapping virtual address physical address mapping also known PTE
The CPU MMU store cache recently used mapping operating system page table
This called TLB associative cache
When virtual address need translated physical address TLB searched first
If match found physical address returned memory access continue
However match called memory management unit operating system TLB miss handler typically look address mapping page table see whether mapping exists
If one exists written back TLB must done hardware access memory TLB virtual memory system faulting instruction restarted may happen parallel well
This subsequent translation find TLB hit memory access continue
The page table lookup may fail two reason When physical memory full simple operation page written back physical memory page table TLB updated instruction restarted
However physical memory full one page physical memory need paged make room requested page
The page table need updated mark page previously physical memory longer mark page disk physical memory
The TLB also need updated including removal page instruction restarted
Which page page subject
The simplest page table system often maintain table page table
The frame table hold information frame mapped
In advanced system frame table also hold information address space page belongs statistic information background information
The page table hold mapping virtual address page address physical frame
There also auxiliary information page present bit modified bit address space process ID information amongst others
Secondary storage hard disk used augment physical memory
Pages paged physical memory disk
The present bit indicate page currently present physical memory disk indicate treat different page
whether load page disk page another page physical memory
The dirty bit allows performance optimization
A page disk paged physical memory read subsequently paged need written back disk since page changed
However page written paged dirty bit set indicating page must written back backing store
This strategy requires backing store retain copy page paged memory
When dirty bit used backing store need large instantaneous total size page moment
When dirty bit used time page exist physical memory backing store
In operating system address space process ID information necessary virtual memory management system know page associate process
Two process may use two identical virtual address different purpose
The page table must supply different virtual memory mapping two process
This done assigning two process distinct address map identifier using process IDs
Associating process IDs virtual memory page also aid selection page page page associated inactive process particularly process whose main code page paged le likely needed immediately page belonging active process
As alternative tagging page table entry identifier page table may occupy different page process page table becomes part process context
In implementation process page table paged whenever process longer resident memory
There several type page table best suited different requirement
Essentially page table must store virtual address physical address virtual address possibly address space information
The IPT best thought extension us normal system RAM
Unlike true page table necessarily able hold current mapping
The OS must prepared handle miss would TLB
The IPT combine page table one data structure
At core table number row equal number frame memory
If frame inverted page table row
For row entry virtual page number VPN physical page number physical address data mean creating collision chain see later
To search entry core IPT structure inefficient may used map virtual address address information need index IPT collision chain used
This hash table known
The hashing function generally optimized coverage raw speed desirable
Of course hash table experience collision
Due chosen hashing function may experience lot collision usage entry table VPN provided check searched entry collision
In searching mapping hash anchor table used
If entry exists page fault occurs
Otherwise entry found
Depending architecture entry may placed TLB memory reference restarted collision chain may followed exhausted page fault occurs
A virtual address schema could split two first half virtual page number second half offset page
A major problem design poor caused
design avoid placing page table entry adjacent page adjacent location inverted page table destroys spatial scattering entry
An operating system may minimize size hash table reduce problem increased miss rate
There normally one hash table contiguous physical memory shared process
make page table impractical identifier used disambiguate page different process
It somewhat slow remove page table entry process OS may avoid reusing identifier value delay facing may elect suffer huge waste memory associated necessary fragmentation hash table
Inverted page table used example architecture
The inverted page table keep listing mapping installed frame physical memory
However could quite wasteful
Instead could create page table structure contains mapping virtual page
It done keeping several page table cover certain block virtual memory
For example create smaller page cover virtual memory
This useful since often part part virtual memory used running process top often used text data segment bottom stack free memory
The multilevel page table may keep smaller page table cover top bottom part memory create new one strictly necessary
Now smaller page table linked together master page table effectively creating tree data structure
There need two level possibly multiple one
A virtual address schema could split three part index root page table index table offset page
Multilevel page table also referred hierarchical page table
It mentioned creating page table structure contained mapping every virtual page virtual address space could end wasteful
But get around excessive space concern putting page table virtual memory letting virtual memory system manage memory page table
However part linear page table structure must always stay resident physical memory order prevent circular page fault look key part page table present page table present page table etc
Nested page table implemented increase performance
By providing hardware support need emulate greatly reduced
For current choice feature feature

I know simple quiz though I still question
Calculate page table size virtual address page size byte per page table entry
First calculate number page virtual address size page size byte page Second calculate page table size number page x number page table entry x byte The question virtual address size byte
Is byte
byte bit

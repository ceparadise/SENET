These day almost TOO many choice degree
Which degree choose
What difference Computer Information Systems v Computer Science major
IS really difference
If one best career path
If trouble choosing IT degree path start asking following three career question interest The question find drawn clue type online degree prefer come Computer Information Systems v Computer Science
Many online IT degree offered today related Computer Science Information Technology Computer Information Systems
Each major share much common also tends focus answering slightly different question
These approach translate turn different career path
Computer Science focus teaching programming computing
It meant give professional foundational skill applied towards career coding
It also provides overview computer operating system work
Computer Science primarily sharpening programming ability
You learn write code lesson plan many online IT degree also learn code work computer way
A Computer Science major often focus programming underlying algorithm make code work
As fair amount math involved ex
Calculus Discrete Mathematics etc
This degree major especially math heavy undergraduate level
Some see math plus many
Also due programming focus subject may interest ex
security networking etc
often touched upon lightly pure Computer Science degree program

Instead learning technology work IS student also learn ask type technology used solve business problem
Where Computer Science go deep programming IS degree go broad cover big picture
Since people part many system degree often include business course like project management managerial communication
The fact cover many different area downside
Information degree give coding experience CS degree
Computer Information Systems degree offered technical college business college across country one IS program may like

Program Interest Program Type For interested information technology wealth specialization within field bit confusing
Two specialization CIS Management Information Systems MIS sound similar play different role information technology field
CIS specialization lot common traditional study computer science
CIS emphasizes technical side organization information system
CIS professional provide expertise installation maintenance troubleshooting computer network infrastructure
They learn diagnose system flaw upgrade hardware software create manipulate database optimize computer security
In case CIS professional work ensure organization networked computer infrastructure needed support modern effective information system
A comparison CIS MIS becomes one emphasis
Imagine spectrum IT department technical support one end managerial support
A CIS professional duty technical side
This say room management within CIS sphere CIS professional may indeed rise oversee department
When CIS professional obtain management position focus usually internal based particular department actual organization network infrastructure
A CIS professional likely tasked data support manager
Where CIS focus technical side organization MIS emphasizes business side
An MIS professional focus computer information facilitate decision making among organization manager
Rather examining information specific single department MIS professional examine data
For example MIS professional might asked information used improve performance organization organization information improved
In term data expertise MIS professional may responsible illustrating sale information corresponds overall business aim performance whether current data system sufficient support informed management policy
The tendency MIS professional focus reliability system information data analysis degree information technology improved better support decision defining contrast MIS CIS
As CIS professional focus MIS professional
As part information technology department MIS professional still expected understand technical component system come together provide information
An MIS professional would however necessarily called provide technical support event system failure
The difference CIS MIS subtle time particularly since substantial overlap background knowledge CIS MIS professional expected
The decision pursue one specialization lie primarily whether would prefer focus technical issue data support
Both CIS MIS professional operate part information technology department typically support responsibility
If decide CIS MIS primary interest formal education provide training credential necessary help professional advance field

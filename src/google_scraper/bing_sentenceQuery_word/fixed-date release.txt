Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process

These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information

However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I run constant issue
When project start client typically list functionality built application
As team would like follow Scrum
But next thing client asks date
The client deadline go market
So valid need know date tell rest business application arrives
Since team ca plan one sprint time typically visibility end date
The client say I already told exactly functionality I need
Tell build app
How deal situation like agile Scrum
Agile release planning based operate feature
In Scrum release planning handled controlling scope meet deadline deadline simultaneously
This rarely practical problem political one shop
Agile release planning based iteration
In order release planning Scrum Number iteration release calculated using following variable formula The value turned back calendar time estimate multiplying interations length Sprints week month

Let say total backlog story point plan use Sprint length
Your team historical velocity project large cone uncertainty fudge factor standard multiplier result planning velocity story point per Sprint applying fudge factor
So release plan Product Backlog Items would You turn calendar time estimate Based information project schedule state take approximately week ship feature currently Product Backlog
This based information currently available treated planning value rather ironclad guarantee
As project progress cone uncertainty narrow team make accurate estimate amount remaining work Product Backlog
In addition Scrum team become accurate measuring velocity project continues calculation redone time time true schedule based accurate data becomes available
In addition Product Owner may add remove scope form Product Backlog Items throughout project
This expand reduce scope project obviously impact estimated schedule
Changing project scope generally trigger recalculation release date happens
Finally Scrum strives provide product end every Sprint
While may sense contains backlog item product stable releasable state Sprint Review organization choose ship earlier sufficient value present product justify shipping current state
This cashing earned value ship minimum viable product deemed good enough provide Scrum team significant agile advantage
The tool Scrum help situation velocity
I believe know velocity many story point sprint check product backlog planning user story
Using two estimation possible delivery date
This highly inaccurate based
If product owner PO negotiate delivery customer based progress delivered user story
The PO figure user story must customer start business
It subset whole product backlog therefore formula provide better estimate uncertainty lower whole backlog
Alternative one check historical data see long take deliver similar app check risk see provide estimation using
Alternative two try way Kanban handle situation In case know velocity historical data try talk customer figure crucial feature
Sit team estimate project old fashioned way
In mean time try
I recommend start initial estimate
If customer understands benefit frequent delivery helpful one schedule upstream project going
Zsolt good starter I giving vote
Scrum work well fixed release date long recognized simple reality
That Scrum one two truth
You either get work backlog done
You know
You release specific date work managed complete date
If client internal bos give fixed date ship use technique like Zsolt talk estimate much work
At start development general guideline commit think
This Hofstadter law stats always underestimate work even take law account
Then joy Scrum move project able use velocity refine prediction deliver
By time way development rock solid idea shipped
This mean need make sure backlog well ordered
Deliver important stuff first minor stuff
So ship everything missing MVP stuff
If client say But must ship different problem
Scrum wo fix need take agile value chain
I recommend Innovation Games Prune Product Tree Buy Feature faced
Note One thing I noticed post mentioned Since team ca plan one sprint time
This flag
Teams working outside normal sprint product owner groom backlog plan future work
By time get sprint already good idea sprint
I got one team worked Product Owner working plan change next eight sprint month
A separate topic one something I wanted bring thinking
The idea Scrum team focus delivering customer want
To work demonstrate listen feedback adapt
This approach recognises hard customer get requirement spot front
It much easier build successful product constant feedback adaptation
If client want fix scope end date project get full benefit Scrum approach
I would suggest talking client selling idea Scrum approach give chance shape product want
There uncertainty end date offset value getting product right
Of course situation client hard deadline
In situation work prioritised backlog requirement far time allowed
If client introduces new requirement project proceeds may reduce far list get
In effect delivered delivered driven much customer delivery team

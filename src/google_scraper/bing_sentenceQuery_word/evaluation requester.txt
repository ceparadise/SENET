The Department Computer Science Michigan Tech introductory course sequence CS Introduction Programming taken first semester CS Introduction Programming taken second semester
The course taught Java assume prior experience writing computer program
If programming knowledge experience Java Python etc
might find introductory course easy
We accelerated introductory course might better fit
CS cover material two course introductory sequence cover one semester rather two
We developed CS Knowledge Assessment
This series question designed help u place course best fit unique combination experience knowledge
The assessment supported online course used refresh knowledge computer science time passed since last programming experience
Engineering transfer student may also take assessment
Contact Leo Ureel email address gain access assessment
If question assessment deadline please contact
Rekhi Hall Townsend Drive Houghton MI Ph Fax Email Copyright Michigan Technological University

Our list contact information advisor
Mail sent reach undergraduate advisor suggested good way contact u since allows first available advisor address question possible
We get especially busy second half semester appreciate patience
For current student help u include name UIN major email
We request schedule appointment undergraduate advisor calling office normal business hour
An appointment graduate advisor made calling office
Staff member located Teague normal business hour also help form without requiring appointment
Prospective student also may schedule visit one advisor calling phone number
We busiest beginning semester week end semester midterm grade received
Although increase available time significantly period may delay scheduling appointment especially registration
Computer Science Computer Engineering separate degree program offered Department Computer Science Engineering different curricular requirement
Generally Computer Science degree CPSC greater emphasis software Computer Engineering degree CECN place greater emphasis hardware system
The CS degree generally flexible allows greater choice elective math science course choice supporting area
The CE degree generally track closely engineering program provides greater depth hardware side computing
Both degree considered Engineering degree Texas A M University
Our department advises Computer track CECN Electrical Computer Engineering advises Computer track CEEN
The overall policy two degree set common committee representative department
Students graduate together undifferentiated Computer Engineering degree
In large part two track administrative reason order allow two department offer degree
There small curricular difference later part degree affecting requirement
The choice track necessarily relate greater interest either software hardware although student primarily software interest may find convenient Computer track

Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun
Not mention lucrative career opportunity
Computer Science The Profession Computer science discipline involves understanding design computer computational process
In general form concerned understanding information transfer transformation
Particular interest placed making process efficient endowing form intelligence
The discipline range theoretical study algorithm practical problem implementation term computational hardware software
A central focus process handling manipulating information
Thus discipline span advancing fundamental understanding algorithm information process general well practical design efficient reliable software hardware meet given specification
Computer science young discipline evolving rapidly beginning
As includes theoretical study experimental method engineering design one discipline
This differs radically physical science separate understanding advancement science application science field engineering design implementation
In computer science inherent intermingling theoretical concept computability algorithmic efficiency modern practical advancement electronics continue stimulate advance discipline
It close interaction theoretical design aspect field bind together single discipline
Because rapid evolution difficult provide complete list computer science area
Yet clear crucial area theory algorithm data structure programming methodology language computer element architecture
Other area include software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation
A professional computer scientist must firm foundation crucial area field likely knowledge one area discipline depending upon person particular area practice
Thus well educated computer scientist able apply fundamental concept technique computation algorithm computer design specific design problem
The work includes detailing specification analysis problem provides design function desired satisfactory performance reliable maintainable meet desired cost criterion
Clearly computer scientist must sufficient training computer science area able accomplish task must also firm understanding area mathematics science well broad education liberal study provide basis understanding societal implication work performed

We conclude brief discussion Java programming language use throughout rest course
By end unit strong understanding history programming well prepared learn programming concept greater detail
Java programming language
Since programming OO currently one popular programming paradigm need learn fundamental concept order build career Computer Science
This unit begin discussion make OO programming unique advantage made paradigm newly designed program
We discus fundamental concept OO relate back Java
By end unit strong understanding programming relates Java employed
Now basic understanding OO programming move fundamental concept programming language studying semester Java
The concept learn unit many case directly transferable number language
We begin learning Hello World basic software application simply print Hello World In unit discus relational logical operator Java provide foundation topic like control structure discus Unit
In unit start taking look operator notation
We discus relational operator apply numeric operand object operand concluding unit introduction logical operator
By end unit able perform comparison logic function Java fundamental understanding employed
Control structure dictate behavior program circumstance
Control structure belong one two family test value determine code executed based value loop performing identical operation multiple time
Control structure like switch program behave differently based data fed
The loop allow repeat block code often needed
As see functionality useful designing complex program
This unit introduce control structure way used moving discus switch loop
We also discus advanced topic nesting scope
By end unit able draw information learned previous unit create control structure allow create complex useful program
In addition method predefined Java write method
In unit discus name method declare parameter list specify return type
This unit introduces scope variable well
By end unit strong understanding define call method
This unit discus Arrays
An Array data structure allows element data type stored
Each array element unique index associated value store
Arrays commonly used loop structure loop
In addition unit introduces array application
In unit discus two important programming concept Java input output well exception handling
Input output technique allow programmer design complex useful program
For reason must fully understand use programming language functionality
In unit discus function Java moving file writing reading data file
Each unit contain discussion applicable Java class part standard programming language FileWriter PrintWriter FileReader BufferedReader IOException
We identify common pitfall design concept keep mind programmer
By end unit strong understanding write read file write Java program performs function
Exception handling mechanism allows program continue executing even error occurs program instead terminating abruptly

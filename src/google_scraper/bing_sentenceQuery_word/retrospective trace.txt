News view insight ESET security community By posted It generally antimalware software detects computer virus worm trojan horse threat scanning file using signature already
A signature could simple string like using find command word processor locate particular piece text complex tiny macro subroutine tell scanning engine look find
Signature scanning work well detecting threat already identified antimalware program detect new previously unseen threat
One method used
But heuristic work
Randy Abrams ESET Director Technical Education find following definition helpful explaining heuristic The science heuristic study information discovered learned
It explains one look problem find solution opposed
Often heuristic rule thumb one might learned
In computer science heuristic algorithm consistently performs quickly provides good result
But antimalware software heuristic also specialized meaning Heuristics refers set opposed specific set program detect malicious behavior without uniquely identify program responsible classic virus scanner work
identifying specific computer virus program
The heuristic engine used antimalware program might include rule following Some heuristic rule may heavier weight thus score higher others meaning match one particular rule likely indicate presence malicious software multiple match based different rule
Even advanced heuristic might trace instruction program code passing computer processor execution allow program run virtual environment sandbox examine behavior performed change made virtual environment forth
In effect antimalware software contain specialized emulator allow trick program thinking actually running computer instead examined antimalware software potential threat
Keep mind term program used necessarily mean executable program file file
A heuristic engine could examining process structure memory data portion payload packet travelling network forth
Likewise heuristic engine simply scan file like classic antivirus program looking known pattern
It might trace instruction program passing code processor execution allow program run virtual environment sandbox examine behavior performed change made virtual environment forth
The advantage heuristic analysis code detect variant modified form existing malicious program new malicious program well
Combined way looking malware signature detection behavioral monitoring reputation analysis heuristic offer impressive accuracy
That correctly detecting high proportion real malware yet exhibiting low false positive alarm rate well since misdiagnosing innocent file malicious cause severe problem
Understanding heuristic work something specialty antimalware field
If interested would like know field I would suggest white paper written David Harley Andrew Lee
For technical examination technology Peter Szor book though several year old still worth reading
Author ESET Hello
ESET virus researcher said file already detected generic signature detects advanced heuristic
Please explain
Generic signature use variety technology
ESET generic signature complex time involve use advanced heuristic time
This part way improve detection keeping false positive low
Thanks answer
Another question fix false positive
Add checksum ESET whitelist something else
There numerous way false positive alarm fixed heuristic checksum hash various type
The exact method would vary based underlying reason false positive occurred
I fix false positive virus lab job It really depends upon false positive
Sometimes modification signature used fix false positive
Sometimes change heuristic required fix false positive
Whitelisting relatively rarely used fix false positive case warranted
Heuristics also known unproved method seem work practice
In term heuristic silver bullet usually yield false positive false negative
Those metric usually difficult evaluate actually people try evaluate heuristic wrong
We know antivirus software perfect usually updated old fashioned signature detection trustable process year experience
Heuristics younger security professional I would need objective reproducible metric heuristic efficiency
So I able manage risk decide worth take risk rely heuristic I used classic signature critical host
Signature scanning heuristic scanning technology many year Matthieu
Around I McAfee Associates began using called fuzzy logic detect subsequently remove boot sector master boot record infecting virus
If ever came across report Generic Boot Generic MBR virus VIRUSCAN type heuristic underlying technology used although use term
The first time I actually heard heuristic Fridrik Skulason around
I believe Frans Veldman Righard Zwienenberg also independently developed heuristic ESaSS ThunderByte well
Classic signature generate false positive false negative alarm saw several case last year
Heuristics ESET case used conjunction classic signature
Together actually reduce chance false positive false negative alarm
As far testing go retrospective testing software one way testing heuristic done Freeze signature update running program newer malware see detected
Results course decay time repeated testing allow determine well heuristic detection performing
Heuristics usually yield false Signatures usually yield false negative signature specific threat prone miss every threat
AV without heuristic viable today
Generic signature type heuristic approach used virtually every antivirus vendor
It would foolish rely heuristic signature alone rely upon security product alone
Hi thanks feedback
From I post I though called heuristic related program behavior
From point view regular expression merely signature
I agree signature yield false positive false negative
Nevertheless mechanism known controled ie taking instance false alarm straighforward understand cause error
When dealing behavior quite complex
Concerning Heuristics usually yield false positive trust good control better
There hardly reproducible study false positive false negative
For example VB test reproducible since test case remains proprietary
Heuristics unproved method inspired intuition seem work practice
I think foolishness reliying obscure technlogy neither controlable provable
Heuristics hardly obsure
Heuristics used virtually antivirus product today
There way test false positive false negative
False positive easily tested scan signature new program change existing signature heuristic may create false positive point
For testing efficacy retrospective testing
You freeze product period time collect brand new threat known exist time product last updated
At end period time scan without updating
Anything detected heuristic detection exception anything missed false negative
When looking result standard testing combined retrospective testing becomes pretty clear combination technology offer significantly better protection
Muy agradecido por toda la informacion Can Heuristics trigger detection similarity Generic signature wildcard found
Hello Yes could heuristic rule

In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

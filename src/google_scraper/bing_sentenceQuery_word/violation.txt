Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

In system determines transaction integrity visible user system
For example user creating Purchase Order created header Purchase Order line header available carrying operation report Purchase Orders see
A lower isolation level increase ability many user access data time increase number concurrency effect dirty read lost update user might encounter
Conversely higher isolation level reduces type concurrency effect user may encounter requires system resource increase chance one transaction block another
Isolation typically defined database level property defines change made one operation become visible
On older system may implemented systemically example use temporary table
In system Transaction Processing TP manager required maintain isolation
In system multiple website attempting book last seat flight combination stored procedure transaction management required commit booking send confirmation customer
Isolation one Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability property
comprises underlying mechanism handle isolation guarantee related correctness
It heavily used database storage engine see guarantee correct execution concurrent transaction different mechanism correctness DBMS process
The mechanism typically constrain database data access operation timing certain order characterized schedule property
Constraining database access operation execution typically mean reduced performance rate execution thus concurrency control mechanism typically designed provide best performance possible constraint
Often possible without harming correctness serializability property compromised better performance
However recoverability compromised since typically result quick database integrity violation
common transaction concurrency control method DBMSs used provide serializability recoverability correctness
In order access database object transaction first need acquire object
Depending access operation type reading writing object lock type acquiring lock may blocked postponed another transaction holding lock object
Of four property Database Management System isolation property one often relaxed
When attempting maintain highest level isolation DBMS usually acquires data may result loss implement control
This requires adding logic function correctly
Most DBMSs offer number control degree locking occurs selecting data
For many database application majority database transaction constructed avoid requiring high isolation level
SERIALIZABLE level thus reducing locking overhead system
The programmer must carefully analyze database access code ensure relaxation isolation cause software bug difficult find
Conversely higher isolation level used possibility increased also requires careful analysis programming technique avoid
The isolation level defined standard listed follows
This isolation level
With DBMS implementation requires read write lock acquired selected data released end transaction
Also must acquired query us ranged clause especially avoid phenomenon
When using based concurrency control lock acquired however system detects among several concurrent transaction one allowed commit
See detail topic
From Second Informal Review Draft Database Language July In isolation level DBMS implementation keep read write lock acquired selected data end transaction
However managed occur
Write skew possible isolation level phenomenon two writes allowed column table two different writer previously read column updating resulting column data mix two transaction
In isolation level DBMS implementation keep write lock acquired selected data end transaction read lock released soon operation performed occur isolation level
As previous level managed
Putting simpler word read committed isolation level guarantee data read committed moment read
It simply restricts reader seeing intermediate uncommitted read
It make promise whatsoever transaction read find data data free change read
This isolation level
In level allowed one transaction may see change made transaction
Since isolation level stronger higher isolation level allows action forbidden lower one standard permit DBMS run transaction isolation level stronger requested Read committed transaction may actually performed Repeatable read isolation level
The different varies quite widely
Most database feature transaction allow user set isolation level
Some DBMS also require additional syntax performing SELECT statement acquire lock
acquire exclusive write lock accessed row
However definition criticized ambiguous accurately reflecting isolation provided many database There also criticism concerning ANSI SQL isolation definition encourages implementors bad thing The standard SQL refers three different Transaction read data Transaction might changed
In following example two transaction take place
In first Query performed
Then second transaction Query performed committed
Finally first transaction Query performed
The query use following data table A aka occurs transaction allowed read data row modified another running transaction yet committed
Dirty read work similarly however second transaction would need committed first query return different result
The thing may prevented READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level update appearing order result earlier update always appear result set later update
In example Transaction change row commit change
Transaction read uncommitted data
Now Transaction roll back change already read Transaction update different change database view data may wrong record Transaction
But case row exists id age
A occurs course transaction row retrieved twice value within row differ read
phenomenon may occur concurrency control method read lock acquired performing acquired lock affected row released soon SELECT operation performed
Under method may occur requirement transaction affected must roll back relaxed
In example Transaction commits successfully mean change row id become visible
However Transaction already seen different value row
At SERIALIZABLE REPEATABLE READ isolation level DBMS must return old value second SELECT
At READ COMMITTED READ UNCOMMITTED DBMS may return updated value read
There two basic strategy used prevent read
The first delay execution Transaction Transaction committed rolled back
This method used locking used produce serial
A serial schedule exhibit behaviour
In strategy used Transaction permitted commit first provides better concurrency
However Transaction commenced prior Transaction must continue operate past version database snapshot moment started
When Transaction eventually try commit DBMS check result committing Transaction would equivalent schedule
If Transaction proceed
If seen equivalent however Transaction must roll back serialization failure
Using concurrency control method REPEATABLE READ isolation mode row ID would locked thus blocking Query first transaction committed rolled back
In READ COMMITTED mode second time Query executed age would changed
Under multiversion concurrency control SERIALIZABLE isolation level SELECT query see snapshot database taken start Transaction
Therefore return data
However Transaction attempted UPDATE row well serialization failure would occur Transaction would forced roll back
At READ COMMITTED isolation level query see snapshot database taken start query
Therefore see different data updated row
No serialization failure possible mode promise serializability made Transaction retried
A occurs course transaction new row added another transaction record read
This occur acquired performing operation
The anomaly special case Transaction repeat ranged query operation Transaction creates
new row target table fulfill clause
Note Transaction executed query twice
If highest level isolation maintained set row returned time indeed mandated occur database operating SQL SERIALIZABLE isolation level
However lesser isolation level different set row may returned second time
In SERIALIZABLE isolation mode Query would result record age range locked thus Query would block first transaction committed
In REPEATABLE READ mode range would locked allowing record inserted second execution Query include new row result
Anomaly Serializable Serializable
That necessary sufficient Serializable schedule free three phenomenon type

I Googled long time I still understand work explanation technical illustration make clearer
My primary confusion virtual memory
I hope question good explanation people ask question find Google
I admit two concept seem quite complicated similar beginning
Sometimes also taught confusingly
A good reference opinion found For sake completion I try explain I guarantee correctness I developed OS month
Segmentation older concept opinion confusing
Segmentation work name say
A segment continuous block memory specific size
To access memory within segment need
This make total two address component fact stored two register
One idea segmentation enlarge memory register
The sort protection elaborate one paging
Because use two register access memory split memory chunk said called segment
Consider memory
This split bit register segment byte
Of course also bit register offset
Addressing byte bit quite useless decided segment overlap I think also performance programming reason back
The following formula used access memory segmentation This mean segment time offset
This also mean address accessed many way
also
This segmentation old day
If look assembler program try something see even called register assembler CS DS code segment data segment
Later called GDT introduced
This global table specific position RAM segment number memory address several option segment given
This brings u nearer concept paging still
So programmer decide segment start
A new concept also GDT one could decide long segment
So segment long bit register limit could defined programmer
You could overlapping segment also purely separated segment
When accessing A B still two register used accessing memory A entry GDT
So look entry GDT see memory location segment start large
We check B offset within allowed memory area
Now paging different newer segmentation approach paging page fixed size
So limit longer programmable page currently
Furthermore unlike segmentation logical address space continuous without physical address continuous
Paging also us table look stuff still split logical address part
The first part number entry page table second part offset
However offset fixed length bit access
You also two part multiple page table used
Two level page table quite common system I think even three level page table common
I hope I able explain least bit I think exaplanation also confusing
Best thing dive kernel programming try implement basic stuff booting OS
Then find everything due backwards compability everything still modern PCs
I direct Segmentation starting die
I suspect paging well future
Edit Let add clarification Segmentation paging two difference mean memory management typically two thing
At risk oversimplification Segmentation allows process access memory natural pointer size would allow
Paging allows process access memory system physically support
Segments The bit system
That allows addressing memory
Late system much memory
A process could map different segment physical memory
A process could access memory could change memory could access within
The successor brought segmenting high art
Using even complex system base register process could access larger area memory
Paging Is system process see continuous relatively range memory address divided page
For example VAX processor bit address allowing access memory theoretically computer typically memory
A process could access much memory system physically plus multiple process
These system presented continuous range memory process virtual memory divided page around byte defined set table mapped disk storage
If process accessed page memory triggered hardware exception
The operating system would intercept exception allocate new page physical memory load memory disk restart instruction
If operating system needed memory handle request would page memory already loaded
If data read usually would loaded executable image would paged
The page could marked invalid
If memory page would written page file storage needed
The Intel chip introduced bizarre system combined segment paging
Segments used data protection
The processor mode away

Since academic conduct Stanford governed Honor Code read follows The purpose webpage make expectation clear possible regarding Honor Code
The basic principle operate expected submit work course
In particular attempting take credit someone work turning constitutes plagiarism serious violation basic academic standard
Under Honor Code obligated follow following rule It act plagiarism submit work copied derived work others submitted
For example using solution Internet solution another student past present source part whole work violation Honor Code
Many Honor Code infraction see make use solution code found online
The best way steer clear possibility search online solution programming assignment
Moreover looking someone solution code order determine solve problem also infraction Honor Code
In essence looking someone code order solve problem class
This appropriate way work hint alternative In particular ask anyone give copy code conversely give code another student asks
Similarly discus algorithmic strategy extent collaborator end turning code
Moreover expected take reasonable measure maintain privacy solution
For example leave copy work public computer post solution code public website
If received aid producing solution indicate got help person section leader TA instructor class help received
A proper citation specifically identify source name book title website URL etc
clear indication assistance influenced work specific possible
For example might write discussed approach used sorting number sortNumbers method Mary If make use assistance without giving proper credit may guilty plagiarism
It also important make sure assistance receive consists general advice cross boundary someone else write actual code show code
It fine discus idea strategy careful write program indicated Rules Please aware submission subject automated plagiarism detection
We desire create climate student feel suspicion
The entire point Stanford Honor Code benefit working atmosphere mutual trust
Students deliberately take advantage trust however poison atmosphere everyone
Stanford employ powerful automated plagiarism detection tool compare assignment submission submission current previous quarter
The tool also compare submission wide variety online solution
These tool effective detecting unusual resemblance program examined course staff
The staff make determination whether submission deemed potential infraction Honor Code referred Stanford Community Standards office
In computer science course usually appropriate ask section leader TAs instructor hint debugging help talk generally strategy program structure
In fact strongly encourage seek assistance need
Discuss idea together coding

A recent report suggested academic honor violation accusation among computer science student single academic discipline
While one two suggested systemic problem somewhat defensive response computer science faculty seemed suggest violation take form plagiarism submitting someone else computer program one original work
They contend violation CS discipline rather faculty simply clever detecting plagiarism mostly automagic method faculty
Said another way CS student plagiarize student extent plagiarize likely caught accused
I propose respond problem suggested report without addressing question whether CS student plagiarize le student discipline whether CS faculty le clever faculty
These question avoid fundamental problem
I propose address underlying problem cheating
I tend see cheating symptom something wrong system pedagogy
Students tend see much matter honor game
Clever faculty simply good game
Clever faculty tactic simply confirm student view
When I prep school Latin mandatory defined cheating use interlinear translation
Indeed tool routine teaching language today considered cheating
Learning issue difficulty issue
Learning difficult thing made easy cheating
Of course learning take place outside school easy efficiency yardstick
Where efficiency measure thing like code rewarded penalized
Code valuable skill easily taught
Similarly since production coding take place team cooperation collaboration rewarded
Restricting teach game important lesson
I suggest gotten cart horse
We le concerned whether student learn right thing whether learn way rely upon measure well learn compared peer
We without even considered whether measurement even useful much le necessary even
We without considering whether encouraging sin good way teach moral
We better reason tradition habit inertia
As student I often wondered everything school seemed hard everything real life comparatively easy
I wondered one ever really taught anything expected learn
I wondered one ever taught skill learning expected intuit trial failure
They persisted strategy even failure became routine suggest intuition failed even failure led discouragement failure
Discouragement seen character flaw punished
The beating continue morale improves
Note one ever really expected learn read write speak Latin
Fluency Latin
It really discipline
Latin useful developing rigor discipline precisely abstract difficult otherwise useless
We still teaching computer science programming programming language like Latin taught grading developing knowledge skill
At level another student suspect
If school grade grading learning code right strategy
If simulation scenario change simulation
I used teach programming teaching language vocabulary grammar saying student write program thing
I expected student compose required originality
I expected student respond specification incomplete one would never tolerate outside academia
I longer teach programming teaching feature language asking student original composition language
Instead I give program work ask change behavior
I give program work ask repair
I give program ask decompose
I give executables ask source source ask comment description specification
I let learn language way learned first language
All tool tactic strategy legitimate
As teacher job help student learn create artificial barrier learning name equitable grading
Nice people put others difficult ethical dilemma
Grading strategy making learning satisfying demonstrating accomplishment
Many student demand grading measure competitor
I remedy fact society turned grade grading something else I get caught agenda I lose sight goal
It job satisfy student paying customer way around
Perhaps cheating strategy student bring artificial problem I created
Perhaps symptom failure teach
I may able compensate culture life experience might predispose cheat I make worse
If one student responds condition I set behavior violates code honor I guilty grave offense
If contest u lost game
In movie Star Trek real life intervenes academic trial Cadet James Tiberius Kirk cheating
The intervention come time prevent academic offense destroying promising career
Real life made moot academic trial young Kirk suggested defense trial ended young warrior rushed battle
I disappointed I hoping argument scenario faculty cheating might vindicated
Not I think adapt pedagogy reduce motive value opportunity cheating rethink use academic honor code
Honor code initiated elite school engaged character formation much education
Few today school make attempt pretense character formation military religious institution
In case one teach character modeling forcing unformed struggle artificial trial
Use honor code resist plagiarism CS best arbitrary capricious
Students raised game game system sometimes tragic result
Often code example clause odds value example peer loyalty student taught

It Friday evening
I lying bed phone hand reading class spread next

I accompanied incessant baby yelping cue every second group tourist taking Christmas card picture front main altar mother loudly whispering direction Vol
VICTOR Stanford Daily It
Your program crashing assignment due midnight
You know error know fix
A simple Google search pull ton working code copying directly program would violating Honor Code
Yet seems like always student give temptation
Stanford Office Community Standards annual case report demonstrate steady increase number Honor Code violation computer science CS year
However enrollment CS class also risen significantly last five year
In academic year student took CS Programming Methodology first course introductory programming series CS department computer science grown
Enrollments rise said Mehran Sahami
professor computer science associate chair education CS department
If imagine percentage Honor Code violation taking place enrollment class twice used going see twice many Few student realize assignment submit run program called Moss
Moss used detect similarity code submission considered standard across institution
Used computer science department worldwide Moss developed Stanford computer science professor Alex Aiken
Developed year ago Aiken time professor Moss designed cut manual labor searching plagiarism
However Aiken emphasized Moss system detecting plagiarism directly
What Moss detects similarity Aiken said
Why code similar human judgment Since code might similar various reason including shared library starter code provided course instructor must check see whether similarity returned Moss constitutes plagiarism
Moss simply help professor determine program flagged higher priority review
It kind smart mean
It know example go change variable name matter Aiken said
It know thing programming allow make judgment two thing really Aiken explained Stanford us Moss compare submission student work class also code available online submission previous year quarter
The program look aspect similar structure identical bug unusual commonality
According Stanford computer science lecturer Julie Zelenski
Moss also account algorithm used significant number student
It also know recognize something idiomatic everyone way Zelenski said
Zelenski also explained since introductory class large graduate student hired build tool manage logistics finding match Moss passing data course instructor
Computer science lecturer Marty Stepp also spoke importance teaching assistant TA examine Moss result first
He part u basically get MOSS result ready u look produce nice executive summary u data place front u easy way u examine Stepp said
We look top match decide one concerning u work really well help u faster Stepp also emphasized student play role deciding whether case pursued
The instructor make decision important note role nothing innocence Stepp said
The TA make call u
We ever farm third Stepp also explained although section leading program play large role grading assignment student section leader responsible looking plagiarism
Instead told contact instructor misconduct suspected according Stepp time section leader experience accurately recognize Honor Code violation
If violation discovered student usually two option choosing Early Resolution Option ERO allowing case go hearing
When case brought Office Community Standards OCS student assigned judicial officer advocate student
If case move trial eventually hearing panel five student one faculty member determines whether student action constitute violation Honor Code
If student found guilty vote panel assigns sanction student
According Stanford OCS standard sanction usually quarter suspension hour community service unless panel find another response appropriate
First instituted ERO give student opportunity immediately accept responsibility action skip judicial hearing process
Zelenski explained ERO give student incentive take responsibility action rather lying avoid sanction
In addition hearing take two month longer ERO resolved within week
The vast majority student I sending OCS choosing pursue ERO alternative rather go full hearing Zelenski said
Even sending student OCS different instructor handle potential honor code violation differently Sahami said
Depending result get back Moss instructor report immediately without talking student
Some prefer talk student Sahami said
We try consistent respect handle Honor Code matter time constraint personal Sahami asks meet student give chance take responsibility advance telling Moss match
We conversation happened I look thing like contrite student Sahami said
Virtually every time I talked student straightforward happened
In case sometimes take little realize honesty best policy make story get Sahami also explained required report case OCS student side admits violating Honor Code
I think issue academic honesty also one punitive really learning Sahami said
I favor leniency side student take As new instructor CS department year Stepp explained fact yet dealt Honor Code violation although finished looking assignment quarter
I lucky enough say I forwarded case far last two quarter Stanford Stepp said
I think always program come listing I feel suspicious added
But I feel I confident match order make accusation I done In term repercussion Honor Code case show student transcript notation kept administrative record reference case future violation
According Zelenski common form punishment include failing grade course community service suspension probation
For repeated unusual case expulsion also rare consequence
Despite Stepp stint Farm Zelenski explained experience teaching CS Computer Organization Systems usually encounter one two case seven assignment
Zelenski spoke main cause Honor Code violation CS including stress created midnight deadline code work
She explained even program well written small bug cause big problem feel like failure
When program work usually really obvious really hard cope Zelenski said
The arbiter correctness obvious Having deadline midnight probably help sense maybe weak tired added
Furthermore copying pasting working code online source make cheating CS especially easy compared subject
It ridiculously easy Zelenski said
It happen space minute student starting feel panicked In general availability code web become inevitable problem especially since form plagiarism require consent two party
Although Zelenski regularly search web online version assignment explained catching every instance difficult spoke case quarter around student CS used part code uploaded software hosting site GitHub
At beginning quarter couple time along way I obvious search place code get put Zelenski said
If I ever find student mine I send nice note say I really want In February Zelenski discovered former CS student uploaded CrashReporter assignment online
She requested code taken student complied student forked repository copied completely different location
When later discovered second version code Zelenski assumed student would find
You looking code way find code I thought one going find Zelenski said
Well turn I would wrong number student found totally used When Honor Code case revealed Moss result Zelenski tried ask student take program
After lack response eventually worked student originally owned code use Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA procedure remove code GitHub
Despite hassle Zelenski explained getting assignment web worth time
She used incident proof given opportunity student plagiarize
If get code web bring incident rate Zelenski said
Stepp emphasized effect code available online especially introductory class
He explained problem compounded fact assignment CS class often kept constant several year new one difficult create
It take time produce computer science homework assignment say math assignment Stepp said
On math assignment produce new problem changing number variable new equation Stepp also discussed fact student took class past likely share solution student currently taking
I think student took class long time ago cavalier handing solution Stepp said
But wrote someone else write want take I think friend le likely share code Zelenski belief another source Honor Code violation student belief beat system
With Moss mostly unadvertised Honor Code discussion beginning course many student understand easy instructor catch plagiarism
I think computer science student Stanford somehow vulnerable le committed integrity political science student major Zelenski said
There certain kind confluence motive opportunity desperation I think also fact find Stepp also emphasized despite stereotype discipline collaboration plagiarism
We want people work together talk want share solution Stepp said
There line
I think people know line unfortunate people cross line I think possible decent amount collaboration student without crossing Unsurprisingly student told similar story effect stress contributing Honor Code violation
Two student Jeff Taylor Walter Smith name changed protect identity spoke experience ERO system particular
Taylor Smith working pair group CS final project Smith allowed friend outside team look code received unexpected email instructor assignment submitted
Unknown either student friend copied part Taylor Smith code submitted
The friend claimed submission accident case ended ERO
Although neither Taylor Smith charged Honor Code violation Smith friend reportedly received failing grade assignment
When asked case Smith Taylor shared thought student might choose plagiarize
There time break Honor Code anything grade
It pressure Smith said
The deadline set working hour one bug left helpless go someone help get one Taylor spoke fine line getting help friend cheating writing code
There fuzzy line getting help cheating CS Taylor said
If need find bug instead spending three hour go someone five minute
And get habit basically people writing code
A lot pressure In case CS specifically getting help expedites process much added
And snowball Smith observed international student particular feel pressure well family home
International student seem face pressure little bit people United States Smith said
There pressure back home well academic really well
If get B unacceptable level
While people realize Stanford getting B bad
But back home one know Stanford grading Yet neither student felt cheating ever justified believed plagiarizing without learning material would hurt student long run
The popular opinion morally wrong cheat learn material Taylor said
In country cheating With rising number online source code instructor continued investigate way discourage student plagiarizing
Stepp attributed lack Honor Code case slight alteration assignment new lecturer
Stepp also added popups class website caution student plagiarism whenever download submit assignment
According Stepp research shown reminder fact affect probability student choosing cheat especially reminder come student start assignment
It really hard know factor impact one educational research show remind student thing key moment make difference Stepp said
Jessie Duan student Board Judicial Affairs spoke Board discussing raising awareness Honor Code violation
One potential effort includes talking freshman plagiarism
One thing focusing raising awareness Duan said
We talking reaching freshman dorm making obvious moment get accepted Stanford Fundamental Standard important Each computer science lecturer professor emphasized department gained bad reputation Honor Code violation simply tool search plagiarism
I think true computer science department whole tend checking department Aiken said
A lot find depends whether Stepp also wanted dispel misconception student need work alone CS assignment
There stereotype want anyone talk anyone computer science isolated allowed contact people figure help whatsoever Stepp said
And I think little bit unfortunate Tagged What qualification Smith make statement like
And relevant rest article
Smith observed international student particular feel pressure well family home
International student seem face pressure little bit people United States Smith said
There pressure back home well academic really well
If get B unacceptable level
While people realize Stanford getting B bad
But back home one know Stanford grading Completely agree The fact person would go far think International Students likely cheat ridiculous maybe explains night getting lower grade international student
Absurd
In fairness cultural difference regarded plagiarism

recent empirical study Hey bud
Smith fact international student high GPA
He rather qualified say
And indeed consensus among international CS student seems line said

In operating system happens several process thread running parallel
These thread may communicate either shared memory message passing
Distribution form concurrency communication simultaneous thread done exclusively via message passing
Distribution useful employ lenient scaling resource consumption economizes resource
Whereas shared memory concurrency often requires single processor per thread distribution allows several thread communicate one another
Concurrency also programming design philosophy
In concurrent programming programmer attempt break complex problem several simultaneous executing process addressed individually
Although concurrent programming offer better program structure sequential programming always practical
In concurrent system computation executed time diverge giving indeterminate answer
They system may end deadlock maximum assigned resource consumption executing thread
Thus design robust concurrency operating system programmer need reduce problem individual parallel task coordinate execution memory allocation data exchange task

Computer information ethic present essay understood branch applied ethic study analyzes social ethical impact ICT
The specific term computer ethic used past several different way
For example used refer application traditional Western ethic theory like utilitarianism Kantianism virtue ethic ethical case significantly involve computer computer network
Computer ethic also used refer kind professional ethic computer professional apply code ethic standard good practice within profession
In addition name cyberethics Internet ethic used refer computer ethic issue associated Internet
During past several decade robust rapidly growing field computer information ethic generated university course research professorship research center conference workshop professional organization curriculum material book journal
In mid innovative development science philosophy led creation new branch ethic would later called computer ethic information ethic
The founder new philosophical field American scholar Norbert Wiener professor mathematics engineering MIT
During Second World War together colleague America Great Britain Wiener helped develop electronic computer new powerful information technology
While engaged war effort Wiener colleague created new branch applied science Wiener named cybernetics Greek word pilot ship
Even War raging Wiener foresaw enormous social ethical implication cybernetics combined electronic computer
He predicted War world would undergo second industrial revolution automatic age enormous potential good evil would generate staggering number new ethical challenge opportunity
When War ended Wiener wrote book described new branch applied science identified social ethical implication electronic computer
Two year later published book explored number ethical issue computer information technology would likely generate
The issue identified two book plus later book included topic still important today computer security computer unemployment responsibility computer professional computer person disability information network globalization virtual community teleworking merging human body machine robot ethic artificial intelligence computer religion number subject
See Bynum
Although coined name cybernetics new science Wiener apparently see also creating new branch ethic
As result coin name like computer ethic information ethic
These term came use decade later
See discussion
In spite Wiener three relevant book lay powerful foundation use effective methodology today field computer information ethic
His thinking however far ahead scholar time many people considered eccentric scientist engaging flight fantasy ethic
Apparently one even Wiener recognized profound importance ethic achievement nearly two decade would pas social ethical impact information technology Wiener predicted late would become obvious scholar general public
In Wiener explored likely effect information technology upon key human value like
The metaphysical idea analytical method employed powerful could used effectively identifying analyzing resolving social ethical problem associated kind information technology including example computer computer network radio television telephone news medium journalism even book library
Because breadth Wiener concern applicability idea method every kind information technology term information ethic apt name new field ethic founded
As result term computer ethic typically used today name subfield Wiener much broader concern
In laying foundation information ethic Wiener developed cybernetic view human nature society led ethically suggestive account purpose human life
Based upon adopted great principle justice believed society ought follow
These powerful ethical concept enabled Wiener analyze information ethic issue kind
Wiener cybernetic understanding human nature stressed physical structure human body remarkable potential learning creativity human physiology make possible
While explaining human intellectual potential regularly compared human body physiology le intelligent creature like insect Given physiology human being possible take wide diversity information external world access information condition event within body process information way constitute reasoning calculating wondering deliberating deciding many intellectual activity
Wiener concluded purpose human life flourish kind organism human naturally Wiener account human nature presupposed metaphysical view universe considers world entity within including human combination information
Everything world mixture according Wiener actually
Consequently brain According Wiener metaphysical view everything universe come existence persists disappears continuous mixing mingling information
Living organism including human being actually pattern information persist ongoing exchange
Thus say human being We whirlpool river water
We stuff abides pattern perpetuate
Wiener The individuality body form rather bit substance
Wiener Using language today information age see example Lloyd Vedral would say according Wiener human being information object intellectual capacity well personal identity dependent upon persisting pattern information information processing within body rather specific bit
According Wiener human being flourish must free engage creative flexible action thereby maximize full potential intelligent being charge life
This purpose human life
Because people various level kind talent possibility however one person achievement different others
It possible nevertheless lead good human life flourish indefinitely large number way example diplomat scientist teacher nurse doctor soldier housewife midwife musician tradesman artisan
This understanding purpose human life led Wiener adopt called great principle justice upon society built
He believed adherence principle society would maximize person ability flourish variety flexibility human action
Although Wiener stated great principle assign name
For purpose easy reference let u call The Principle Freedom The Principle Equality The Principle Benevolence
Using Wiener word yield following list great principle pp
Justice requires liberty human develop freedom full measure human possibility embodied Justice requires equality A B remains position A B Justice requires good man man know limit short humanity Given Wiener cybernetic account human nature society follows people fundamentally social being reach full potential part community similar being
Society therefore essential good human life
however actually indeed violate three great principle justice
For reason Wiener explicitly adopted fourth principle justice assure first three would violated
Let u call additional principle The Principle Minimum Infringement Freedom What compulsion existence community state may demand must exercised way produce unnecessary infringement freedom
If one grant Wiener account good society human nature follows Sometimes ethical relativists use existence different culture proof could underlying ethical foundation society around globe
In response relativism Wiener could argue given understanding human nature purpose human life embrace welcome rich variety culture practice still advocating adherence great principle justice
Those principle offer even though leave room immense cultural diversity
The one restriction Wiener would require society must provide context human realize full potential sophisticated agent making decision choice thereby taking responsibility life
Wiener believed possible significant freedom equality human compassion prevail
Because Wiener think creating new branch ethic provide metaphilosophical comment analyzing information ethic issue case
Instead plunged directly analysis
Consequently want know Wiener method analysis need observe rather look metaphilosophical commentary upon procedure
When observing Wiener way analyzing information ethic issue trying resolve find example try
In given society network existing practice law rule principle govern human behavior within society
These policy borrow helpful word Moor constitute received policy cluster see Bynum Schubert reasonably society serve
Wiener methodology combine received policy cluster one society Wiener account human nature plus great principle justice plus critical skill clarifying vague ambiguous language
In way achieved effective method analyzing information ethic issue
Borrowing Moor later apt description computer ethic methodology Moor describe Wiener methodology follows In essentially society society received policy cluster reasonably method analyzing resolving information ethic issue likely result ethically good solution assimilated society
Note way information ethic require expertise trained philosopher although expertise might prove helpful many situation
Any adult function successfully reasonably society likely familiar existing custom practice rule law govern person behavior society enable one tell whether proposed action policy would accepted ethical
So must cope introduction new information technology whether computer professional business people worker teacher parent maker others engage information ethic helping integrate new information technology society ethically acceptable way
Information ethic understood important left information professional philosopher
Wiener information ethic interest idea method broad covering topic specific field computer ethic would call today also issue related area today called agent ethic see example Floridi Internet ethic Cavalier nanotechnology ethic Weckert
The purview Wiener idea method even broad enough encompass subfields like journalism ethic library ethic ethic bioengineering
Even late Wiener made clear view integration society newly invented computing information technology would lead remaking society second industrial revolution automatic age
It would affect every walk life would process requiring decade effort
In Wiener word new information technology placed human being presence another social potentiality importance good However think creating new branch ethic Wiener coin name computer ethic information ethic describe
These term beginning computer ethic came common use year later starting mid work Walter Maner
see Maner Today information age Wiener predicted half century ago come existence metaphysical scientific foundation information ethic laid continues provide insight effective guidance understanding resolving ethical challenge engendered information technology kind
In nearly three decade publication Wiener book Walter Maner noticed ethical question problem considered Medical Ethics course Old Dominion University often became complicated significantly altered computer got involved
Sometimes addition computer seemed Maner actually generated
He concluded new branch applied ethic similar already existing field like medical ethic business ethic
After considering name information ethic decided instead call proposed new field computer ethic
At time Maner know computer ethic work Norbert Wiener
He defined proposed new field one study ethical problem aggravated transformed created computer technology
He developed experimental computer ethic course designed primarily student computer science program
His course success student university wanted teach regularly
He complied wish also created starter kit teaching computer ethic prepared dissemination attendee workshop ran speech gave philosophy conference computing science conference America
In Helvetia Press National Information Resource Center Teaching Philosophy published Maner computer ethic starter kit monograph Maner
It contained curriculum material pedagogical advice university teacher
It also included rationale offering course university suggested course description university catalog list course objective teaching tip discussion topic like privacy confidentiality computer crime computer decision technological dependence professional code ethic
During early Maner widely disseminated Helvetia Press college university America elsewhere
Meanwhile Maner continued conduct workshop teach course computer ethic
As result number scholar especially philosopher computer scientist introduced computer ethic Maner trailblazing effort
While Maner developing new computer ethic course colleague Philosophy Department Old Dominion University Deborah Johnson became interested proposed new field
She especially interested Maner view computer generate ethical problem believe true
As result Maner Johnson began discussing ethic case allegedly involved problem brought computer
In discussion Johnson granted computer indeed transform old ethic problem interesting important way give new twist agree computer generated problem never seen
The resulting discussion initiated fruitful series comment publication nature uniqueness computer ethic series scholarly exchange started Maner Johnson later spread scholar
The following passage Maner keynote address drew number people discussion Over decade followed publication provocative passage extended uniqueness debate led number useful contribution computer information ethic
For example publication see Johnson Maner Tavani Himma Floridi Sanders Mather Bynum
By early Johnson joined staff Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute secured grant prepare set teaching material pedagogical module concerning computer ethic turned successful
She incorporated textbook published Johnson
On page noted computer pose new version standard moral problem moral dilemma exacerbating old problem forcing u apply ordinary moral norm uncharted She grant Maner claim however computer create ethical problem
Instead described computer ethic issue old ethical problem given new twist computer technology
Johnson book first major textbook field quickly became primary text used computer ethic course offered university country
For decade textbook set computer ethic research agenda topic ownership software intellectual property computing privacy responsibility computer professional fair distribution technology human power
In later edition Johnson added new ethical topic like hacking people computer without permission computer technology person disability ethic Internet
Also later edition Johnson continued discussion noting example new information technology provide new way instrument human action
Because agreed Maner new ethic question generated computer technology example Should ownership software protected law Do huge database personal information threaten privacy argued question merely new specie old moral issue protection human privacy ownership intellectual property
They insisted ethic problem requiring addition traditional ethical theory Maner claimed Maner
The year watershed year history computer ethic appearance Johnson textbook also James Moor classic paper What Is Computer Ethics published special issue journal
There Moor provided account nature computer ethic broader ambitious definition Maner Johnson
He went beyond description example computer ethic problem offering explanation computing technology raise many ethical question compared kind technology
Moor explanation revolutionary power computer technology computer logically malleable The logical malleability computer technology said Moor make possible people vast number thing able
Since one could question may never arisen whether one
In addition could done perhaps law standard good practice specific ethical rule ever established govern
Moor called situation policy vacuum vacuum might generate conceptual muddle In late Moor policy vacuum explanation need computer ethic account revolutionary logical malleability computer technology quickly became influential among growing number computer ethic scholar
He added additional idea including important notion According Moor human value important continued survival community essentially community value
Indeed community value core value soon would cease exist
Moor used core value examine computer ethic topic like privacy security Moor add account justice called consequentialism Moor theory combine core value consequentialism Bernard Gert deontological notion moral impartiality using blindfold justice
Moor approach computer ethic practical theory provides broad perspective nature information revolution
By using notion logical malleability policy vacuum conceptual muddle core value consequentialism provides following method The third step accomplished combining deontology consequentialism traditionally considered incompatible rival ethic theory achieve following practical result Beginning computer ethic work Norbert Wiener common thread run much history computer ethic namely concern Thus specific issue Wiener dealt case defending advancing value
For example working prevent massive unemployment caused robotic factory Wiener tried preserve security resource opportunity factory worker
Similarly arguing use machine Wiener tried diminish threat security peace
This approach computer ethic fruitful
It served example organizing theme major conference National Conference Computing Values Southern Connecticut State University see section exponential growth devoted impact computing upon
In late similar approach computer ethic called computer design emerged based upon insight potential problem avoided new technology development See example Brey Friedman Friedman Nissenbaum Introna Introna Nissenbaum Flanagan et
In early different emphasis within computer ethic advocated Donald Gotterbarn
He believed computer ethic seen ethic devoted development advancement standard good practice code conduct computing professional
Thus article Computer Ethics Responsibility Regained Gotterbarn said Throughout aspect computer ethic mind Gotterbarn worked advocate example Keith Miller Dianne Martin Chuck Huff Simon Rogerson variety project advance professional responsibility among computer practitioner
Even Gotterbarn part committee ACM Association Computing Machinery create third version organization Code Ethics Professional Conduct adopted ACM see Anderson et
Later Gotterbarn colleague ACM Computer Society IEEE Institute Electrical Electronic Engineers developed licensing standard software engineer
In addition Gotterbarn headed joint taskforce IEEE ACM create Software Engineering Code Ethics Professional Practice adopted organization see Gotterbarn Miller Rogerson
In late Gotterbarn created Software Engineering Ethics Research Institute SEERI East Tennessee State University see http early together Simon Rogerson developed computer program called SoDIS Software Development Impact Statements assist individual company organization preparation ethical stakeholder analysis determining likely ethical impact software development project Gotterbarn Rogerson
These many project focused attention upon advanced professionalization ethical maturation computing practitioner

In presentation The Computer Revolution Problem Global Ethics Krystyna made startling prediction see Górniak
She argued computer ethic eventually evolve global ethic applicable every culture earth
According Górniak hypothesis regional ethical theory like Europe Benthamite Kantian system well diverse ethical system embedded culture world derive local history custom unlikely applicable
Computer information ethic hand Górniak argued potential provide global ethic suitable Information Age The provocative Górniak hypothesis significant contribution ongoing uniqueness debate reinforced Maner claim made conference keynote address information technology force u discover new moral value formulate new moral principle develop new policy find new way think issue presented Maner Górniak speculate globally relevant concept principle would evolve information ethic
She merely predicted theory would emerge time global nature Internet resulting ethic conversation among culture world
Górniak may well right
Computer ethic today appears evolving broader even important field might reasonably called global information ethic
Global network especially Internet connecting people earth
For first time history effort develop mutually agreed standard conduct effort advance defend human value made truly global context
So first time history earth ethic value debated transformed context limited particular geographic region constrained specific religion culture
This could one important social development history Bynum Floridi
Consider global issue If computer user United States example wish protect freedom speech Internet whose law apply
Two hundred country interconnected Internet United States Constitution First Amendment protection freedom speech local law Internet apply rest world
How issue like freedom speech control pornography protection intellectual property invasion privacy many others governed law many country involved
Lessig If citizen European country example Internet dealing someone land government country considers dealing illegal European tried court country
In recent year rapid expansion global cyberbusiness
Nations appropriate technological infrastructure already place enjoyed resulting economic benefit rest world lagged behind
What political economic fallout inequality
In addition accepted business practice one part world perceived cheating fraud part world
Will wealthy nation widen already big gap rich poor
Will political even military confrontation emerge
If inexpensive access global information net provided rich poor alike people ghetto poor nation underdeveloped world etc
first time history nearly everyone earth access daily news free press text document art work great library museum world political religious social practice people everywhere
What impact sudden profound global education upon political dictatorship isolated community coherent culture religious practice etc
As great university world begin offer degree knowledge module via Internet lesser university damaged even forced business
The gap rich poor nation even rich poor citizen industrialized country already disturbingly wide
As educational opportunity business employment opportunity medical service many necessity life move cyberspace gap rich poor become even worse
Important recent development began appear confirming Górniak hypothesis particular metaphysical theory Luciano Floridi see example Floridi Flourishing Ethics theory present author combine idea Aristotle Wiener Moor Floridi see Bynum
Floridi developing information ethic theory henceforth argued purview computer ethic indeed ethic general widened include much simply human being action intention character
He developed FIE another macroethics term utilitarianism deontologism contractualism virtue ethic intended applicable ethical situation
On hand FIE traditional Western theory rather go beyond traditional theory overridden sometimes traditional ethical consideration
Floridi The name information ethic appropriate Floridi theory treat everything exists informational object process All entity described cluster data informational object
More precisely existing entity discrete encapsulated package containing At level abstraction informational system rather living system general raised role agent patient action environmental process change interaction equally described informationally
Floridi Since everything exists according FIE informational object process call totality exists universe considered whole infosphere
Objects process infosphere significantly damaged destroyed altering characteristic data structure
Such damage destruction Floridi call entropy result partial empoverishment infosphere
Floridi offer four fundamental principle FIE based upon idea everything infosphere least minimum worth ethically respected even worth overridden consideration By construing every existing entity universe informational least minimal moral worth FIE supplement traditional ethical theory go beyond shifting focus one ethical attention away action character value human agent toward evil harm dissolution destruction entropy suffered object process infosphere
With approach every existing entity human animal plant organization even artifact electronic object cyberspace piece intellectual property interpreted potential agent affect entity potential patient affected entity
In way Floridi treat FIE ethical theory used addition traditional anthropocentric ethical theory like utilitarianism deontologism virtue theory
FIE emphasis preserving enhancing infosphere enables Floridi provide among thing insightful practical ethical theory robot behavior behavior artificial agent like softbots cyborg
See example Floridi Sanders
FIE important component ambitious project covering entire new field Philosophy Information term
See Floridi The paragraph describe key contribution history idea information computer ethic history discipline includes much
The birth development new academic field require cooperation among critical mass scholar plus creation university course research center conference academic journal
In regard year pivotal information computer ethic
The publication Johnson textbook plus special issue journal October including especially Moor article What Is Computer Ethics provided excellent curriculum material conceptual foundation field
In addition Maner earlier trailblazing effort people inspired Maner generated audience enthusiastic computer science philosophy scholar
The stage set exponential growth
The formidable foundation computer information ethic Wiener laid late early far ahead time social ethical thinker follow lead help create vibrant growing field computer information ethic even earlier
In United States rapid growth occurred information computer ethic beginning
In Research Center Computing Society founded Southern Connecticut State University
Shortly thereafter Director present author joined Walter Maner organize National Conference Computing Values NCCV funded America National Science Foundation bring together computer scientist philosopher public policy maker lawyer journalist sociologist psychologist business people others
The goal examine push forward major information computer ethic namely computer security computer privacy ownership intellectual property computing person disability teaching computer ethic
More dozen scholar several different discipline joined Bynum Maner plan NCCV occurred August Southern Connecticut State University
Four hundred people American state seven country attended conference generated wealth new computer ethic material monograph video program extensive bibliography disseminated hundred college university following two year
In decade professional ethic advocate Donald Gotterbarn Keith Miller Dianne Martin professional organization Computer Professionals Social Responsibility Electronic Frontier Foundation Special Interest Group Computing Society SIGCAS ACM spearheaded project focused upon professional responsibility computer practitioner
Information computer ethic became required component undergraduate computer science program nationally accredited Computer Sciences Accreditation Board
In addition annual Computers Freedom Privacy conference began see ACM adopted new version Code Ethics Professional Conduct
In rapid growth information computer ethic spread Europe present author joined Simon Rogerson De Montfort University England create Centre Computing Social Responsibility organize first computer ethic conference Europe
That conference included attendee fourteen different country mostly Europe became key factor generating critical mass computer ethic scholar Europe
After every month another ETHICOMP conference occurred moving country country Europe beyond Spain Netherlands Italy Poland Portugal Greece Sweden Japan China Argentina Denmark France
In addition assistance Bynum Rogerson Australian scholar John Weckert Christopher Simpson created Australian Institute Computer Ethics organized Melbourne Australia first international computer ethic conference south equator
A number AICE conference occurred since see http
A central figure rapid growth information computer ethic Europe Simon Rogerson
In addition creating Centre Computing Social Responsibility De Montfort University influential ETHICOMP conference also added computer ethic De Montfort University curriculum created graduate program advanced computer ethic degree including PhDs Ben Fairweather two computer ethic journal see section Other Internet Resources electronic journal see Other Internet Resources
Rogerson also served Information Technology Committee British Parliament participated several computer ethic project agency European Union
Other important computer ethic development Europe late early included example Luciano Floridi creation Information Ethics Research Group Oxford University mid Jeroen van den Hoven founding CEPE Computer Ethics Philosophical Enquiry series conference occurred alternately Europe America van den Hoven creation journal Rafael Capurro creation International Center Information Ethics Capurro creation journal Bernd Carsten Stahl creation
In summary since computer ethic development proliferated exponentially new conference conference series new organization new research center new journal textbook web site university course university degree program distinguished professorship
Additional topic information computer ethic continually emerge information technology grows proliferates
Recent new topic include ethic agent ethic robot softbots cyborg ethic part human part machine open source movement electronic government global information ethic information technology genetics computing developing country computing terrorism ethic nanotechnology name example
For specific publication example see list selected resource
Compared many scholarly discipline field computer ethic young
It existed since late Norbert Wiener created
During next decade grew little Wiener insight far ahead everyone else
Beginning however information computer ethic grown exponentially first America Europe globally

In property relates number used algorithm
An algorithm must determine resource usage
Algorithmic efficiency thought analogous engineering repeating continuous process
For maximum efficiency wish minimize resource usage
However various resource
time space compared directly two algorithm considered efficient often depends measure efficiency considered important
requirement high speed minimum memory usage performance benchmark
The importance efficiency respect time emphasised applying mechanical analytical engine In almost every computation great variety arrangement succession process possible various consideration must influence selection amongst purpose calculating engine
One essential object choose arrangement shall tend reduce minimum time necessary completing calculation Early electronic computer severely limited speed operation amount memory available
In case realized whereby task could handled either using fast algorithm used quite lot working memory using slower algorithm used little working memory
The engineering use fastest algorithm would fit available memory
Modern computer significantly faster early computer much larger amount memory available Gigabytes instead Kilobytes
Nevertheless emphasised efficiency still important consideration In established engineering discipline improvement easily obtained never considered marginal I believe viewpoint prevail software engineering An algorithm considered efficient resource consumption computational cost acceptable level
Roughly speaking mean run reasonable amount time available computer
Since computer seen dramatic increase available computational power available amount memory current acceptable level would unacceptable even year ago
Computer manufacturer frequently bring new model often higher
Software cost quite high case simplest cheapest way getting higher performance might buy faster computer provided existing computer
There many way resource used algorithm measured two common measure speed memory usage measure could include transmission speed temporary disk usage disk usage power consumption response time external stimulus etc
Many measure depend size input algorithm
amount data processed might also depend way data arranged
sorting algorithm perform poorly data already sorted sorted reverse order
In practice factor affect efficiency algorithm requirement accuracy reliability
As detailed way algorithm implemented also significant effect actual efficiency though many aspect relate optimization issue
In theoretical analysis algorithm normal practice estimate complexity asymptotic sense
use represent complexity algorithm function size input
This generally sufficiently accurate large may misleading small value
bubble sort may faster quicksort item sorted
Some example Big O notation include For new version software provide comparison competitive system sometimes used assist gauging algorithm relative performance
If new algorithm produced example compared predecessor ensure least efficient known consideration functional improvement
Benchmarks used customer comparing various product alternative supplier estimate product best suit specific requirement term functionality performance
For example world certain proprietary product independent software company compete product major supplier speed
Some benchmark provide opportunity producing analysis comparing relative speed various compiled interpreted language example compare performance implementation typical programming problem several programming language
Even creating benchmark get least appreciation relative performance different programming language using variety user specified criterion quite simple produce Nine language Performance roundup Christopher demonstrates example Implementation issue also effect actual efficiency choice programming language way algorithm actually coded choice particular language compilation option used even operating system used
In case language implemented may much slower language implemented compiler
There factor may affect time space issue may outside programmer control include subroutine call
Some processor capability allow single instruction operate multiple operand may may easy programmer compiler use capability
Algorithms designed sequential processing may need completely redesigned make use
Another problem arise compatible processor may implement instruction different way instruction relatively fast model may relatively slow model make life difficult optimizing compiler
Measures normally expressed function size input
The two common measure For computer whose power supplied battery
calculation
measure interest In case le common measure may also relevant algorithm typically using analysis get estimate running time function size input data
The result normally expressed using
This useful comparing algorithm especially large amount data processed
More detailed estimate needed algorithm comparison amount data small though situation time le likely problem anyway
Algorithms include parallel processing may difficult analyse
Use benchmark time use algorithm
Many programming language available function provides CPU time usage
For algorithm elapsed time could also interest
Results generally averaged several test
This sort test sensitive hardware configuration possibility program task running time environment
This sort test also depends heavily selection particular programming language compiler compiler option algorithm compared must implemented condition
This section concerned use main memory often RAM algorithm carried
As time analysis algorithm typically using analysis get estimate memory needed function size input data
The result normally expressed using
There four aspect memory usage consider Early electronic computer early home computer relatively small amount working memory

maximum working memory word Sinclair came initially byte working memory
Current computer relatively large amount memory possibly Gigabytes squeeze algorithm confined amount memory much le problem used
But presence three different category memory significant An algorithm whose memory need fit cache memory much faster algorithm fit main memory turn much faster algorithm resort virtual memory
To complicate issue system three level cache memory varying effective speed
Different system different amount various type memory effect algorithm memory need vary greatly one system another
In early day electronic computing algorithm data would fit main memory algorithm could used
Nowadays use virtual memory appears provide lot memory cost performance
If algorithm data fit cache memory high speed obtained case minimising space also help minimise time
An algorithm fit completely cache memory exhibit may perform reasonably well
Software efficiency half every month compensating Moore Law In ubiquitous system halving instruction executed double battery life big data set bring big opportunity better software algorithm Reducing number operation N x N N x log N dramatic effect N large N billion change good year technology improvement
The following competition invite entry best algorithm based arbitrary criterion decided judge

Many programming task done one way one way might much faster another
Designing fast program part art science computer programming
We look couple example exercise
The fascinating simple sequence number
You start two number
Then rule
Therefore next number
This give first three term fourth term forth The Fibonacci sequence originally invented talk rabbit population fantastic connection architecture plant
Here part awesome video series Fibonacci number The definition Fibonacci number lends naturally recursive function
The next exercise defines function give th item list starting
However recursive function becomes slow compute entry sequence
Press type
When test get Time Limit Exceeded
Why going slowly
The function complicated instruction loop addition
So slowness turn related number total call function
If call recursive function called three time total initial call two recursive call
If call recursive function called five time initial call three time mentioned one recursive call
Computing make total nine call make total call
The number call get large quickly grows
As rough estimate requires least twice many total recursive call since call directly another time indirectly recursive call
So computing time proportional least large
This slow
requires recursive call
This argument even outline exact conceptual problem calling twice answer scratch second time wasteful
We come approach waste time thing
Let try something Python similar introduction
We started writing
Then kept extending sequence adding last two element together
Here code look like unscramble
There still little room improvement since need whole array new call good enough since run quickly even large value n
Our second example checking whether number important cryptography computer security
A number prime exactly two factor
The first prime number
For example prime factor well
How test whether number prime Python
We saw test divisibility So testing possible divisor arrive following program
It work
But also slow large number
Pick type
It run time
Try value prime greater code always run time grader execute loop million time per second
If want check larger number need efficient idea
Let make code work even number big trillion
Do really need check number check prime
If read hint experimented might noticed prime program usually found pretty small factor compared
For example run pretty quickly even though input gigantic finding divisor
Maybe actually need check possible factor
Is small limit number factor need check sure prime
Thankfully yes
In fact argue
Why
Well prime divisor
Being divisor mean number Let continue argument
If happy found factor small like wanted
But actually possibility otherwise get impossible contradiction Great
So let implement new idea Python
The easiest way change old approach add test within loop equivalently loop stop testing
The program work gigantic prime
In exercise combine prime second half lesson approach first half
Your code fill table length equal prime composite one million

There several sometimes contradictory meaning word efficient
To efficient mean thing cheaply possible
That seems typically English way thinking day cheap matter even quality low result
To others mean task well minimum fuss
That make think stereotype German Industry good quality done rigorously Computer Scientists precise way treat idea efficiency developed general way talking
It basically minimizing much resource use complete task
The resource minimize vary important one often
What matter usually finding way guarantee get task done step possible
A lot puzzle element kind efficiency
When I kid I spent lot time perfecting skill solving Rubik Cube
I wanted able consistently solve minute
One way able spin fast think fast
That made small amount difference though
What really mattered I came way took step possible get solution however cube started
Without realising I developing computational thinking skill

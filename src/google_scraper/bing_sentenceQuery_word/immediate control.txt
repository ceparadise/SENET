Tough GCSE topic broken explained team expert teacher Learn art brilliant essay writing help teacher Get head around tough topic teacher written guide Start writing remarkable essay guidance expert teacher team Understand tough topic IB teacher written Study Guides Learn art brilliant essay writing experienced teacher Struggling assignment
Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction Author James Leong Mook Seng Education Officer Control Unit Memory Unit Arithmetic Logic Unit The CPU Central Processing Unit central part computer
Because CPU performs many different function need divide component
There component namely Arithmetic Logic Unit ALU Control Unit Immediate Access Store known IAS primary memory Arithmetic Logic Unit ALU The ALU thing actually done processor
It perform arithmetic calculation data
For example add two number together binary
It perform logic decision made data If value negative part processor make decision ALU
These computation involve use AND OR NOT
The third task ALU act gateway processor part computer system
All input output processor go ALU wait control unit decides
Control Unit
All computer follow instruction given program
These instruction particular order program following carrying mean computer accomplished whatever task meant
Something computer manage instruction make sure part processor
This job control unit
The control unit four job
It decide instruction carry next go get

It decipher instruction word work need done carry instruction
Middle printer keyboard
Common Peripheral Devices Any hardware device part computer system part processor called peripheral device
Peripheral device categorised four heading

Communication device
These device allow communication machine covered detail Transmission Networking
Storage device
These device provide secondary storage computer system described

Input device
Keyboard
A standard keyboard us key stand different character computer recognises character set
Most keyboard contain letter alphabet instance calculator keyboard different keyboard use ATM machine
The character needed specialist use machine determined use machine put
Keyboards common form input device system universally available understood
The common keyboard known QWERTY keyboard first six character top line
The design good two reason
The arrangement character come original typewriter whose keyboard arranged difficult use order slow typist jam mechanism old machine
The keyboard difficult use comfortably way key arranged rigid row making awkward keep arm comfortable using
The first problem difficult solve experienced operator use present keyboard well
Retraining use different arrangement key would feasible
Various attempt made address second problem arranging key curve fit palm hand rather straight line
Conclusion However two answer mixed together produce confused often wrong answer
This first statement important set parameter question answered
You say answer make clear done
Also mark point mark available
Hopefully getting used generally true question
In question obviously two point interrupt two buffer order get mark must make sure definition appears somewhere
So interrupt need earn last mark point otherwise defined interrupt
A
Input protection user access content menu system use us human reaction pointing training necessary Output Touchscreen output choice user select available producing hardcopy permanent record customer Storage drive necessary store detail product sale large number change occur file
CDROM used keep store plan location department change
Notice large number possible mark point
Also way mark split
In type question ca expect lot mark simply writing long list peripheral device mark split according four type peripheral mentioned section
In reality question would probably talked system available throughout store would mean would able communicate one another
As communication come next section left example question question would normally mark mark type peripheral
Hardware James Leong Mook Seng AS This student written piece work one many found section
Advantage network secure one administrator control network put password whatever want
One disadvantage technology us silicon space per storage cell dynamic memory thus chip capacity lot le dynamic chip
ROM A ROM chip memory chip store instruction data permanently
AND The AND gate somewhat different NOT gate time take two input rather one
For AND gate output high voltage must receive two input one
An algorithm make fetch decode execute cycle repeat successfully
The algorithm look follows
If jump process implemented
Retrieve next instruction using programme counter
Decode bit pattern instruction register
Parallel Port A longer thin D shaped connector parallel device often used connecting printer USB Port A small socket usually labelled USB
A fast new alternative way connect modern device USB Scanners USB Joysticks USB Modems etc
CD Sample This bad database
It four field tell detail potential user many CD stock
The data placed order difficult user find Title CD CD want order
completely opposite input
The output always input mix
The input expression gate
The line stand NOT
Laser printer superior term print quality speed resolution

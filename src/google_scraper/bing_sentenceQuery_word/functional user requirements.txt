Difference requirement context designing software system
Give example case
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Let elaborate
An example would A related system may The functional requirement relates system functionality
The requirement system
Typically requirement fall area A complete list available Wikipedia entry
requirement sometimes defined term metric something measured system make tangible
requirement may also describe aspect system relate execution rather evolution time
maintainability extensibility documentation etc
functional requirement main thing user expects software example application banking application application able create new account update account delete account etc
functional requirement detailed specified system design acquirement straight forward requirement system rather related usability way example banking application major requirement availability application available time possible
Functional requirement specifies function system system component must able perform
It documented various way
The common one written description document use case
Use case textual enumeration list well diagram describing user action
Each use case illustrates behavioural scenario one functional requirement
Often though analyst begin eliciting set use case analyst derive functional requirement must implemented allow user perform use case
Functional requirement system
It may A typical functional requirement contain unique name number brief summary rationale
This information used help reader understand requirement needed track requirement development system
already explained requirement
I add
requirement requirement functional requirement
This requirement specifies criterion used
requirement form overall property system whole particular aspect specific function
The system overall property commonly mark difference whether development project succeeded failed
requirement divided two main category Whether requirement expressed functional requirement may depend Ex
A system may required present user display number record database
This functional requirement
How update number need requirement
If number need updated real time system architect must ensure system capable updating displayed record count within acceptably short interval number record changing
References activity system must perform Functional requirement related technical functionality system
requirement requirement specifies criterion used judge operation system particular condition rather specific behavior
For example consider shopping site adding item cart browsing different item applying offer deal successfully placing order come functional requirement
Where performance system peak hour time taken system retrieve data DB security user data ability system handle large number user login come non functional requirement
I think client developer side regarding functionality user software developer client
requirement given client provided developer run system smoothly
safety security flexibility scalability availability etc

But ever wondered product came
How went idea someone head item use touch
Well easy take several formalized step
The first gather requirement
A written description characteristic capability new upgraded product design must incorporate
They often quite detailed describe must provided provided
In word exclude implementation detail
Requirements document appear legally binding language used specific
In particular requirement must provided includes word shall
For example If requirement might provided word used may
For example A requirement describes operation activity
For example Note requirement describe HOW activity done WHAT done
Similarly think everyday product say pen functional requirement might indicate casing green
Another might indicate button extends stylus case
A requirement describes measure whether functional requirement met
For example This one little trickier describing operation
Rather describing metric used determine performance operation described
If think back pen example requirement might button allow minimum stylus extension

A good set user requirement needed project especially computer system project successful
This many project fail specify correctly system
In fact many system given deadline delivery budget spend vague notion
The root problem As result paralysis set business management time concentrated meeting timescales budget rather going delivered
The truth need great deal technical knowledge specify requirement fact big disadvantage
A requirement computer system specifies want desire system
For business particular
This advantage need reduction cost fact many system justified reduction operating cost fail deliver low skilled relatively cheap staff replaced high skilled expensive staff
The advantage reduction time process something lead reduction cost able better use unique knowledge base belonging business
As start specify want desire hit technical language requirement
Fear quite straightforward These type behaviour want system perform
If buying vehicle business functional requirement might Similarly computer system define system
For example The important point note wanted specified delivered
These often lead much mystical mumbling implying high priest computing fraternity person understand
They however quite simple restriction constraint placed system build
Their purpose restrict number solution meet set requirement
requirement split two type performance development
These constraint system perform delivered
The vehicle example without constraint might result solution offered everything large truck sport car
To restrict type solution might include performance constraint You may include
Similarly computer system might specify value generic type performance constraint For customer record example might The important point restrict number solution option offered developer
used prove met
In addition performance constraint may include development constraint
These mainly fall field still restriction type solution offered
There three general type development constraint Design objective assist selecting solution number offered
Only know important feature new system whether fast large storage easy use whatever
Unfortunately want compromise made
Experiments team developer showed deliver system according defined top design objective
A number team given identical set functional requirement different design objective make system fast small use small amount computer storage easy use etc
Each team delivered system met top objective fully objective lesser degree
If produce set design objective priority order developer produce might want
For customer record example top design objective could easy user find customer information
The good type requirement allow development team provide number option select suitable solution
However many set requirement given developer polluted design implementation solution
This mean customer told developer conduct business
Examples design solution Examples implementation solution Each say system built design deliver may miss better solution due making design decision
There may good reason statement seen number design know valid
When set requirement produced often large complex
The reality time scale resource mean wo delivered least first time
The customer prioritise requirement specify want nice
A method
If customer prioritise done developer may select part process easiest produce technically challenging taking account need organisation
A good set use requirement consists prioritised set And NOT design implementation decision
Producing enable get system deliver business advantage

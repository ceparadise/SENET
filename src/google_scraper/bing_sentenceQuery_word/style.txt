Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is citation style within computer science field
By citation style I referring three general method Browsing show roughly split option occasional
So I really two question The answer may I imagine something like Everyone us even though clearly easier read
Regarding Both ACM IEEE use citation style safe say reader academic article CS familiar style
Therefore use style paper look similar conference journal article CS
Regarding experience citation style Smith effective reader
This opinion shaped department Computational Social Science I read mix paper CS Statistics Social Science Economics others
My reason favoring make easier read paper line
Having read many paper given field I familiar cited seminal work
If I see Padgett Powell I immediately know reference I guess
But I see tell nothing
I go look reference list memorize stand Padgett Powell every time I see
But nature discipline nature paper lead difference role citation serve text
In Social Sciences general citation structural discourse field
Citations often mark school thought line argument research lens
In contrast Computer Science citation much utilitarian function point paper provide theoretical foundation attempted approach problem solved
In way intellectual bill material research behind CS paper
The numbered reference sufficient giving anyone pointer bill material need
Another justification citation style shorten page count paper
In opinion le le justified era people read paper electronically print
A computer science paper go either IEEE ACM use one standard citation style feel like computer science paper many reader

This manual contains suggestion hoped contribute towards writing clear pleasant looking hopefully interesting article
This guide meant substitute rather complement much useful information Wikipedia editor
Probably hardest part writing technical article difficulty addressing level technical knowledge part reader
A general approach start simple move toward formal technical statement article proceeds
The article start two describes subject general term
This opening paragraph give casual reader quick understanding concept
Name field computer science concept belongs describe context term used
Write bold
Include historical motivation provide name date etc
Here example
In describing pattern interaction
It member family mathematical theory concurrency known process algebra
CSP first described paper since evolved substantially
CSP practically applied industry tool concurrent aspect variety different system
The theory CSP still subject active research including work increase range practical applicability
CSP influential development
It good idea begin main part article informal introduction give reader basic understanding fundamental concept topic presented
It helpful section informal introduction concept question somewhat theoretical
It also useful representative could serve expand concept question also provide context one might want use concept
A picture great way bringing point home often could even precede technical discussion concept
hint create graph picture include article
If included introductory paragraph section concept often useful provide additional insight motivation
Computer science broad field encompasses number different kind idea
The structure main part article vary type article
Here general guideline structuring different class computer science article
Where possible guideline include one two example good article article demonstrates style aiming particular class article
Always keep mind rule article need deviate structure article hard classify wo fit classification
Use common sense applying guideline
An article algorithm generally consist A good example article
An article data structure consist An article describing classic problem generally consist An example
The good guideline structure article describing design pattern
An article describing field study within computer science include An article describing kind formalism contain A good example
An article describing programming construct generally include Examples include
An article describing programming language generally include least A good example article
An article describing theorem conjecture generally contain least As many computer science theorem conjecture often stated informally popular literature may also beneficial provide discussion common misconception misinterpretation theorem conjecture
Good example include
An article describing class tool generally contain Examples include
It good section connects related subject page could provide insight content current article
Lastly complete article reference section
This topic discussed detail
Samples actual source get included article variety reason although typical reason demonstrate look particular language provide example construct feature provide example algorithm easily expressed pseudocode
While nothing inherently wrong including sample code excessive amount detract content article avoid writing sample code unless contributes significantly fundamental understanding encyclopedic content

Code relevant encyclopedic content moved Wikipedia
WikiBooks appropriate Wikimedia project existing code particular
The external wikis appropriate place put sample implementation along description implementation work
existing implementation Wikipedia transferred LiteratePrograms wiki Wikipedia content licensed LiteratePrograms us liberal relicensing existing code would require permission copyright holder Some general guideline code sample This typesets monospaced typeface ensure spacing preserved provides additional information user customized CSS
Doing particularly important language whitespace syntactic like people able copy paste sample code text editor IDE
For example There universally accepted standard presenting algorithm Wikipedia
A past attempt standardized pseudocode archived though author advises proposal advanced unlikely gain consent
Within WikiProject consensus generally possible algorithm presented pseudocode
Use pseudocode completely language agnostic NPOV respect programming language general
Pseudocode also provides far flexibility regard level implementation detail allowing algorithm presented however high level required focus algorithm core idea rather detail implemented
Finally suitably pseudocode provides presentation algorithm particularly
Example pseudocode roughly hewing guideline provided example page
Examples algorithm format include
It quite important article list reference pointer literature
Some reason following The article information also several example cited literature look

Lonny PhD student teaching positive psychology bachelor degree IT master degree psychology
Most web page made hypertext markup language
This standard way decorate plain web text font color graphic doodad hyperlink clickable text magically transport user somewhere else
But website get really big
When happens HTML hard way easy thing
cascading style sheet make decorating web site easy
Think CSS kind computer dress code
mainly one thing describes web page look
Even better CSS easily separated HTML dress code easy find easy modify rapidly change entire look web site
Like dress code school change CSS look student change
Style sheet allow rapidly alter entire website please like fashion craze allows people change time yet remain people
A really neat thing CSS
Each style define add overall theme yet make recent style override earlier style
For example CSS start saying want text unit high
Later say want red
Still later tell want one phrase bold italic blue rather red
CSS come three type style sheet separate file full CSS instruction file extension
When web page includes external stylesheet look feel controlled CSS file unless decide override style using one next two type
This change whole website
And perfect want keep latest fashion web page without rewriting every page
style placed top web page document content listed
This next best thing external easy find yet allow external style sheet special page want nonconformist
style placed right need next text graphic wish decorate
You insert inline style anywhere middle HTML code giving real freedom specify web page element
On hand make maintaining web page real chore
Before introduce CSS let briefly review HTML
A simple web page made
Everything must go opening closing html tag
The head section contains invisible direction called
The body section put visible stuff
Here super simple HTML example Now short simple example CSS using external file call
We going tell web page white make heading noted simple HTML example Adams appear red unit high In sample file top line comment anything
The next part called body tell web page background color use section
Right part say want largest heading color red font size unit high
Now include external CSS file include link within head section blank web page shown screen We need include external CSS file decorate one web page
We define style top page head section
Here quick example making heading blue font size px Get FREE access day create account
For special time something page ca conform overall theme well go ahead let show true individuality using inline CSS
To show let override style shall
That way show power CSS time
As see sample head section originally told style blue unit high
But CSS let u override certain place
In case included instruction within body section inline snippet CSS told website show heading Hancock red font px high
Did think easy
If right quite bit CSS want get power
CSS offer something called let specify decorate site element wo go today
Just know lot
Let review amazing cascading style let u dress web page uniformly without changing content
Think style sheet kind computer dress code uniform way display web page consistent look feel
We learned style sheet come three type
one file apply every web page includes
one apply whole document put top page header
let specific spot really stand different cost hard find modify
CSS also thing called let specify decorate site element

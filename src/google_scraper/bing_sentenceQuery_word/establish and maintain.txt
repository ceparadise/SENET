In particular interactive information interchange also known dialogue conversation meeting two communicating device computer user see
A session set established certain point time torn later point
An established communication session may involve one message direction
A session typically always meaning least one communicating part need save information session history order able communicate opposed communication communication consists independent request response
An established session basic requirement perform
A session also basic step transmit mode
However unidirectional transmission define session
may implemented part protocol service
In case transport protocol implement formal session layer session application layer generally HTTP session maintained higher level program using method defined data exchanged
For example HTTP exchange browser remote host may include identifies state unique information user preference authorization level
thought allow single request response one Session
Protocol version improved completing CGI making easier maintain Web Session supporting file uploads
Most session maintained transport layer single connection single session
However transaction phase session creates separate connection
Maintaining session continuity phase requires
The embedded within A HREF FORM link passed back CGI
CGI us ensure session continuity transaction phase
One advantage one work well low bandwidth modem connection
TCP session typically implemented software using new process thread created computer establishes join session
HTTP session typically implemented using one thread per session mean database information state session
The advantage multiple process thread relaxed complexity software since thread history encapsulated variable
The disadvantage large overhead term system resource session may interrupted system restarted
When client may connect server cluster server special problem encountered maintaining consistency server must maintain session state
The client must either directed server duration session server must transmit session information via shared file system database
Otherwise client may reconnect different server one started session cause problem new server access stored state old one
session handy efficient become difficult handle conjunction system usable embedded system storage
The problem solved using shared storage applying forced peering client single server cluster although compromise system efficiency load distribution
A method using session system without reserve portion RAM storage session data
This method applicable server limited number client
router access point infrequent disallowed access one client time
session use cooky cryptographic technique maintain state without storing much data server
When presenting dynamic web page server sends current state data client web browser form cookie
The client save cookie memory disk
With successive request client sends cookie back server server us data remember state application specific client generate appropriate response
This mechanism may work well context however data stored client vulnerable tampering user software access client computer
To use session confidentiality integrity required following must guaranteed To accomplish server need encrypt session data sending client modification information party prevented via cryptographic mean
Transmitting state back forth every request practical size cookie small
In essence session trade server disk space extra bandwidth web request require
Moreover web browser limit number size cooky may stored web site
To improve efficiency allow session data server may compress data creating cookie decompressing later cookie returned client
A session token unique identifier generated sent identify current interaction session
The client usually store sends token sends parameter GET POST query
The reason use session token client handle session data stored server usually client direct access linked identifier
Examples name programming language use naming HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID PHPSESSID CGISESSID ASPSESSIONID
In process keeping track user activity across session interaction
Typical session management task include keeping track application open document application opened state restored user log log later
For website session management might involve requiring user session expired certain time limit passed without user activity
It also used store information HTTP request
A desktop session manager program save restore desktop session
A desktop session window currently running current content
Session management system provided
On system session management provided Session Manager Subsystem user session functionality extended application like
Session management particularly useful user save open page setting restore later date
To help recover system application crash page setting also restored next run
example web browser support session management
Session management often managed application
HTTP stateless client computer running web browser must establish new TCP network connection web server new HTTP GET POST request
The web server therefore rely established TCP network connection longer single HTTP GET POST operation
Session management technique used web developer make stateless HTTP protocol support session state
For example user authenticated web server user next HTTP request GET POST cause web server ask user account password
For discussion method used accomplish see In situation multiple web server must share knowledge session state typical environment session information must shared cluster node running web server software
Methods sharing session state node cluster include multicasting session information member node see one example technique sharing session information partner node using sharing session information node using network socket storing session information shared file system storing session information outside cluster
If session information considered transient volatile data required transaction contain data subject compliance auditing example see example two law necessitate compliance auditing method storing session information used
However session information subject audit compliance consideration given method used session storage replication clustering
In Simple Object Access Protocol message constructed Extensible Markup Language message used consumer application cause web server create session
Just HTTP stateless protocol
As SMS became interoperable across rival network text messaging started ascent towards becoming ubiquitous global form communication various enterprise became interested using SMS channel commercial purpose
Initial service require session management since communication example
Today application referred distinct messaging
The development interactive enterprise application required session management SMS stateless protocol defined GSM standard early implementation controlled enter command service identifier manually

These instructional material reflect growing knowledge student learn informed knowledge design implementation instructional resource large scale though research needed aspect
In discipline instructional material help student learn also help teacher improve practice
Instructional material support specific teacher professional development provide teacher assessment tool inform teaching daily basis
There little incentive school district include CS course
There requirement college level state requirement basic course material computer expensive purchase maintain
The decision include CS course fall individual school district level
Coupled lack instructional material result vastly different experience student across country
CS course also tend ephemeral leaving school funding reduced CS teacher leave school phenomenon directly tied CS course lack priority
Recommendation Establish policy enable school district prioritize CS coursework student access quality CS education
These policy developed careful consideration student learning requirement student schedule pay careful attention change management issue arise within school result implementation
There pathway become CS teacher
Furthermore little incentive teacher commit teaching CS school district generally prioritize CS coursework
Individuals CS experience many career option teaching
Those interest teaching find resource education leading certification support related subject mathematics
Recommendation In short medium term develop deploy strategy help existing teacher become excellent CS teacher
In long term one expect CS course prioritized accompanied robust standard curriculum teacher professional development CS teaching emerge viable path
These change may increase number teacher entering CS teaching career
CS teacher colleague close share idea information discipline provide instructional support coaching
The lack colleague collaborator source new information CS instruction compounded low prioritization CS school lack instructional material lack criterion quality CS instruction
This make improving instruction difficult affect motivation
Recommendation Dedicate resource build sustain online network CS teaching learning leading including teacher school PD provider

The first Department Computer Sciences United States established Purdue University October
There three natural phase history
In effort define course degree program indirectly field
The saw department maturation growth typical university department
The started series crisis nationwide internal Purdue eventually gave department considerably different character
Table present chronology
The first task Samuel Conte new department head hire faculty define graduate program
The course offering planned large enough graduate course
degree undergraduate service course programming
In first year five teaching faculty Samuel Conte Richard Kenyon Duane Pyle Robert Korfhage Saul Rosen
Although faculty taught full time could offer course year ample support planned program
In three new faculty member Richard Buchi Walter Gautschi John Steele
The following year John Rice hired
The new Mathematical Sciences building completed department along statistic moved Engineering Administration building
The Computer Sciences Center occupied two floor ground
The department occupied fourth floor substantially larger previous space also much nicer
The Department Computer Sciences part Division Mathematical Sciences along Departments Mathematics Statistics
Initially Felix Haas head division also head mathematics department three department partially independent within division They set degree requirement separately one graduate committee one qualifying exam system
This arrangement appropriate view small size computer science statistic department
The undergraduate program evolved initially sparse course offering programming computer science option mathematics department separate
degree approved
Conte active member Association Computing Machinery committee recommended model
degree program known Curriculum
It closely resembled degree program Purdue one test bed developing Curriculum
It well undergraduate computer science program included variety offering common science
By beginning department completed pioneering year Degree program established faculty dozen computer science department university Purdue department fully independent
The decade consolidation maturation
But still serious challenge perhaps difficult hiring faculty
Throughout almost every computer science department unfilled position computer science many major industry
The faculty shortage compounded another trend became widespread change discipline using paper punched card discipline significant experimental science component
Some computer science department originated engineering experimental component beginning end department including Purdue originated mathematics started establish significant experimental component
The second serious challenge computer science department everywhere establish scientific respectability
Many science engineering faculty knew computing contact Fortran programming assumed computer science
Even though Purdue Department Computer Sciences consistently rated top ten reaffirm permanence value continually part university
The third serious challenge evolution course
In spite repeated reorganization course expansion offering seemed always course required complete restructuring
The department simply enough faculty keep course time situation persists today
The growth maturation held seed crisis hit first half
These crisis stemmed numerous major need lack resource meet
The number entering freshman majoring computer science grow About entered
Enrollment increased year
In number increased crisis u see
This growth nationwide
For one year early survey showed high school graduate wanted study computer science
If percentage continued computer science would many student engineering
By fall freshman starting computer science
Earlier group student advancing curriculum undergraduate course overflowed new section added overflowed
The administration offer increase number position department completely safe
The department already unfilled position would increase number faculty
The explosion handled primarily increasing class size
Examples extreme situation period The senior level course numerical analysis taught single lecture section student teaching assistant grader graduate course compiler student grading assistant teaching assistant student lower division course
There corresponding lack computing facility support course
When computer science started changing experimental discipline space needed departmental computing teaching lab research lab
The result tighter tighter packing faculty simply could engage laboratory work
For example faculty member asked department head secretary help support work
Heads usually reply money case department head said I understand let
Tell want secretary I hire one
This offer safe head knew room department put even one desk
The department acquired first general purpose computer VAX
It first VAX running VAX UNIX outside developer site Berkeley AT T Bell lab
The motivation need interactive computing environment
It practical computing center provide service widespread basis unwilling one department
It however inevitable department would set facility need became specialized diverse satisfied centralized service center
This move part nationwide trend computer science become experimental laboratory oriented
This crisis real handled much smoothly others administration willingness support growth
The extent change required illustrated
In period major new operation established within department
This contributed space shortage department
In response building selected January renovation house computer science department
The renovation completed quickly building occupied fall
The space excellent quality year department enjoyed ample space
However need lab supporting staff research assistant grew rapidly packing process repeated
Recovery crisis occurred
Moving newly renovated Computer Sciences building dramatically improved morale
Not environment greatly improved opportunity start teaching research laboratory kind
The computing facility type space yet equipment needed provide facility
This physical improvement accompanied initial solid evidence flood student receding
Only little freshman class declared computer science major

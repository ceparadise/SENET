In also called basic
A record collection possibly different data type typically fixed number sequence
The field record may also called particularly
Fields may also called though risk confusion element
A may may considered record vice versa depending convention specific programming language
For example date could stored record containing numeric field field represented string numeric field
A Personnel record might contain
A Circle record might contain instance center might represented record containing coordinate
Records distinguished fact number field typically fixed field name field may different type
A describes value variable
Most modern computer language allow programmer define new record type
The definition includes specifying data type field name label accessed
In field name generally preferred due simplicity proper record type studied language
Since record may contain field addition data express many feature
Records exist storage medium including
Records fundamental component data structure especially
Many computer organized array often grouped larger physical record efficiency
The parameter often viewed field record variable argument passed function viewed record value get assigned variable time call
Also often used implement procedure call entry containing procedure parameter local variable return address internal field
An object language essentially record contains procedure specialized handle record object type elaboration record type
Indeed language record special case object known PODSs contrast object use OO feature
A record viewed computer analog
In vein record type viewed computer language analog two implementation abstract specific language
A record may zero A key field set field record serf identifier
A unique key often called simply
For example employee file might contain employee number name department salary
The employee number unique organization would primary key
Depending storage medium file organization employee number might also stored separate file make lookup faster
The department code may unique may also indexed case would considered
If indexed entire employee file would scanned produce listing employee specific department
The salary field would normally considered usable key
Indexing one factor considered designing file
The concept record traced various type used since remote time
The modern notion record computer science field type size already implicit century mechanical calculator
The original medium used data opposed control used record punch card single record
Compare journal entry punch card
Records well established first half century data processing done using punched card
Typically record data file would recorded one punched card specific column assigned specific field
Generally record smallest unit could read external storage
card reader tape disk
Most implementation early special syntax record concept available extensively used use
Some early computer hardware support delimiting record field special instruction copying record
The concept record field central early file utility
first widespread programming language support record type record definition facility quite sophisticated time
The language allows definition nested record alphanumeric integer fractional field arbitrary size precision well field automatically format value assigned insertion currency sign decimal point digit group separator
Each file associated record variable data read written
COBOL also provides statement assigns corresponding field two record according name
The early language developed numeric computing support record type later version language add
The original lacking record except provided adequate surrogate
The one first language fully integrate record type basic type logically consistent type system
The programming language provided record
The programming language initially provided record concept kind template could laid top memory area rather true record data type
The latter provided eventually declaration two concept still distinct language
Most language designed Pascal also supported record
The selection field record value yield value
Some language may provide facility enumerate field record least field reference
This facility needed implement certain service
It requires degree
In system record subtyping operation value record type may also include In setting specific record type implies specific set field present value type may contain additional field
A record field would thus belong type record field would record field
The rationale passing record function expects record argument work since function find field requires within record
Many way practically implementing record programming language would trouble allowing variability matter central characteristic record type theoretical context
Most language allow assignment record exactly record type including field type name order
Depending language however two record data type defined separately may regarded distinct type even exactly field
Some language may also allow assignment record whose field different name matching field value corresponding field variable position within record example field called assigned record variable field
In alternative two operand still required sequence field type
Some language may also require corresponding type size encoding well whole record assigned uninterpreted
Other language may flexible regard require value field legally assigned corresponding variable field example field assigned field vice versa
Other language may match field value name rather position
These possibility apply comparison two record value equality
Some language may also allow order comparison using based comparison individual field
allows preceding type assignment also allows record structure terminology
In Algol array record integer field one could write obtain array integer consisting field element
As result statement would effect
In command would execute command sequence field record declared variable
So instead writing one could write
The representation record memory varies depending programming language
Usually field stored consecutive position memory order declared record type
This may result two field stored word memory indeed feature often used access specific bit word
On hand compiler add padding field mostly invisible programmer order comply alignment constraint imposed field must occupy single word
Some language may implement record array address pointing field possibly name type
Objects language often implemented rather complicated way especially language allow
A type record contains information identify record type locate information within record
It may contain offset element element therefore stored order may omitted
Alternatively various element record including element identifier simply follow one another order
The following show example record definition

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

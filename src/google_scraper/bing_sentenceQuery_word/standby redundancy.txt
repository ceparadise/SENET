In duplication critical function system intention increasing reliability usually form backup improve actual system performance case receiver computer processing
In many system part control system may triplicated formally termed TMR
An error one component may two
In triply redundant system system three sub component three must fail system fails
Since one rarely fails sub component expected fail independently probability three failing calculated extraordinarily small often outweighed risk factor human error
Redundancy may also known term majority voting system voting logic
Redundancy sometimes produce le instead greater reliability creates complex system prone various issue may lead human neglect duty may lead higher production demand overstressing system may make le safe
In computer science four major form redundancy A modified form software redundancy applied hardware may usually designed redundant part well ensuring one part fails entire structure collapse
A structure without redundancy called meaning single broken component cause collapse entire structure
Bridges failed due lack redundancy include
Parallel combined system demonstrate different level redundancy
The model subject study reliability safety engineering
The two function redundancy passive redundancy
Both function prevent performance decline exceeding specification limit without human intervention using extra capacity
Passive redundancy us excess capacity reduce impact component failure
One common form passive redundancy extra strength cabling strut used bridge
This extra strength allows structural component fail without bridge collapse
The extra strength used design called margin safety
Eyes ear provide working example passive redundancy
Vision loss one eye cause blindness depth perception impaired
Hearing loss one ear cause deafness directionality impaired
Performance decline commonly associated passive redundancy limited number failure occur
Active redundancy eliminates performance decline monitoring performance individual device monitoring used voting logic
The voting logic linked switching automatically reconfigures component
Error detection correction Global Positioning System GPS two example active redundancy
Electrical power distribution provides example active redundancy
Several power line connect generation facility customer
Each power line includes monitor detect overload
Each power line also includes circuit breaker
The combination power line provides excess capacity
Circuit breaker disconnect power line monitor detect overload
Power redistributed across remaining line
author said sometimes redundancy backfire produce le reliability
This may happen three way First redundant safety device result complex system prone error accident
Second redundancy may lead shirking responsibility among worker
Third redundancy may lead increased production pressure resulting system operates higher speed le safely
Voting logic us performance monitoring determine reconfigure individual component operation continues without violating specification limitation overall system
Voting logic often involves computer system composed item computer may reconfigured using voting logic
Circuit breaker example form voting logic
Electrical power system use reconfigure active redundancy
Computing system adjust production output generating facility generating facility suddenly lost
This prevents blackout condition major event earthquake
The simplest voting logic computing system involves two component primary alternate
They run similar software output alternate remains inactive normal operation
The primary monitor periodically sends activity message alternate long everything All output primary stop including activity message primary detects fault
The alternate activates output take primary brief delay activity message cease
Errors voting logic cause output active inactive time cause output flutter
A reliable form voting logic involves odd number three device
All perform identical function output compared voting logic
The voting logic establishes majority disagreement majority act deactivate output device disagree
A single fault interrupt normal operation
This technique used system responsible operation
Each duplicate component added system decrease probability system failure according formula This formula assumes independence failure event
That mean probability component B failing given component A already failed B failing A failed
There situation unreasonable using two power supply connected socket way one power supply failed would
It also assumes one component needed keep system running

Network redundancy process additional alternate instance network device equipment communication medium installed within network infrastructure
It method ensuring network availability case network device path failure unavailability
As provides mean network failover
Network redundancy primarily implemented enterprise network infrastructure provide redundant source network communication
It serf backup mechanism quickly swapping network operation onto redundant infrastructure event unplanned network outage
Typically network redundancy achieved addition alternate network path implemented redundant standby router switch
When primary path unavailable alternate path instantly deployed ensure minimal downtime continuity network service

The general definition redundancy exceeding normal
However computing term used specifically refers duplicate device used purpose
The goal redundancy prevent recover failure specific system
There many type redundant device
The common personal computing backup
While computer component easily replaced fails may possible recover personal data
Therefore important regularly back data secondary hard drive
In enterprise situation configuration used mirror data across two drive
Another type redundant device secondary
High traffic critical system may multiple power supply take case primary one fails
While uninterruptible power supply technically redundant device battery within surge protector provides power redundancy minute electricity lost
Computer network often implement redundancy well
From Internet connection common redundant data path
This mean one system go connection system broken
For example network duplicate data ring used automatically primary data path interrupted
Network redundancy accomplished either adding extra physical connection using networking software automatically reroutes data needed

HSRP protocol provides backup router event failure
Using HSRP several router connected segment work together present appearance single
The router share therefore event failure one router host LAN able continue forwarding consistent IP MAC address
The process transferring routing responsibility one device another user
Hot Standby Router ProtocolHSRP standard method CISCO thatroutes IP traffic without relying availability single router providing high network availability redundancy IP host configured default gateway IP
frist hope redandancy protocol CISCO
Practically run network provide high availabilty towards network setting Gateway Hot Standby Router Protocol HSRP Is routing protocol devolped cisco allows host computer internent use muliple router act single virtual router maintaining connectivity even first hop fails
Hot Standby Router Protocol cisco propriety protocol provides redundant gateway host local subnet solution
protocol support high availability system almost uptime Often one best least redundant part network first hop host rest network
If device fails user specific segment using default gateway unable reach subnet including Internet
There number different solution problem grouped together referred First Hop Redundancy Protocols FHRP
Cisco recommend Hot Standby Redundancy Protocol HSRP Cisco developed several year ago standardized solution existed
One way achieve percent network uptime use HSRP provides network redundancy IP network ensuring user traffic immediately transparently recovers first hop failure network edge device access circuit
The general idea behind HSRP rather simple Configure multiple device exist subnet able act gateway host subnet
Basic redundancy configured configuring host use one gateway host use another Do need help adding right keywords CV

What happens Internet router go lose Internet access
That important include redundancy network
In edition Cisco Routers Switches David Davis explains use Hot Standby Router Protocol HSRP ensure redundancy
By What happens Internet router go lose Internet access
Is acceptable organization
You probably get away two minute need better plan calling support desk
That important include redundancy network
Consider adding backup router current router take moment notice
All need hardware Cisco software take care rest
Let examine configure using Hot Standby Router Protocol HSRP
HSRP Cisco proprietary protocol redundancy
It provides nearly percent router availability redundancy
So one router go backup router take routing function primary one
However available industry protocol supported Cisco
One industry standard VRRP
Another HSRP alternative GLBP another Cisco proprietary solution
Before discus configure HSRP let take look network use example
To help better understand HSRP work basic network diagram In sample network configured PC default gateway IP address
However IP address point real device instead serf virtual IP address whichever router primary
When using HSRP router either primary standby
If primary router send HELLO packet standby router period time standby router assumes primary router thus take
The standby router assumes responsibility virtual IP address begin responding virtual Ethernet MAC address virtual IP address pointing
The primary standby router exchange HSRP HELLO packet know router
These HELLO packet use multicast UDP port
The basic form HSRP available since IOS newer feature released version IOS
What determines active router
First configure priority number determine highest IP address
The default priority number higher priority number signifies preferred router
Of course setting router redundancy limited two router
In fact set group router work together multiple standby router
You accomplish almost HSRP configuration router Interface Configuration Mode using command
Let look step I took configure network shown diagram
For Router For Router Now let look configuration sample network
You use command Privileged Mode check status HSRP
This command tell router active standby well number statistic
On PC default IP address point either router
This way one router go take
And may even able use redundancy take production router day HSRP failover time le second
HSRP valuable tool ensuring high availability router redundancy
Of course also several HSRP option I address article

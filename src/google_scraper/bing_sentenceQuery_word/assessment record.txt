Computer science previously formed option group Diploma Programme curriculum lie within group
As regarded experimental science alongside biology chemistry design technology physic environmental system society
This group change significant mean DP student select computer science group subject rather select addition mathematics previously case
The IB computer science course rigorous practical discipline
Features benefit curriculum assessment follows Two course level offered standard level SL higher level HL
Computational thinking lie heart course integrated topic
This supported practical activity including programming
Candidates learn programming skill critical element developing skill applicable virtually field study
Four course option available database modelling simulation web science object oriented programming These option allow particular subject interest studied defined subject teacher Algorithmic thinking externally assessed level
This mean external assessment focus student algorithmic thinking mastery syntax particular programming language
Practical programming experience essential element developing thinking skill may assessed part internal assessment
There designated language
This allows teacher select programming language feel appropriate teaching practical element course Syllabus content reviewed regularly This ensure course content remains current A new component introduced HL linked annually issued case study expand student knowledge new topic investigative study
This allow student investigate greater depth current issue computer science included syllabus

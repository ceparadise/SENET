Lynn BS MS biology taught many college biology course
The word refer center atom control center cell
This lesson discus nucleus cell
You different type cell body
Some really thin long like nerve cell run way spinal cord foot
Some like fat cell rounded shape
No matter cell look like one important thing common
This control center found inside cell point life
A nucleus responsible determining controlling cell look like
A encloses nucleus keep separate surrounding material cell
Sometimes substance need move nucleus possible little hole nuclear envelope called
Inside nucleus least one mass called
occupies rest space inside nucleus
DNA genetic material instruction necessary build protein
Proteins responsible helping activity cell
Your DNA organized basically instruction manual body
Without gene body would able make protein
Proteins absolutely necessary make sure everything body working properly
The nucleus help protect important DNA
More specifically nuclear envelope keep gene separate structure inside cell
The brain body control center
The nucleus cell control center
The nucleus oversees many process occur inside cell
Let take look closely
Get FREE access day create account
final step produce protein occurs outside nucleus
So transcription three type RNA molecule must leave nucleus
The way RNA molecule exit nuclear pore
Once outside instruction mRNA read help rRNA tRNA used create protein
Proteins responsible controlling chemical reaction cell
Let review
The surround protects genetic material called
Just like brain oversees activity whole body many cellular process managed nucleus
These process include
Gene expression involves three type RNA nucleus mRNA protein outside nucleus

The cell membrane bound structure contains cell hereditary information control cell growth reproduction
It command center eukaryotic commonly prominent cell
The cell nucleus bound double membrane called
This membrane separate content nucleus
Like nuclear envelope consists form lipid bilayer
The envelope help maintain shape nucleus assist regulating flow molecule nucleus
The nuclear envelope connected way internal compartment nuclear envelope continuous lumen ER
The nucleus organelle house
Chromosomes consist contains heredity information instruction cell growth development reproduction
When cell resting
chromosome organized long entangled structure called individual chromosome typically think
Nucleoplasm gelatinous substance within nuclear envelope
Also called karyoplasm material similar cytoplasm composed mainly water dissolved salt enzyme organic molecule suspended within
The nucleolus chromosome surrounded nucleoplasm function cushion protect content nucleus
Nucleoplasm also support nucleus helping maintain shape
Additionally nucleoplasm provides medium material enzyme DNA RNA subunit transported throughout nucleus
Substances exchanged cytoplasm nucleoplasm nuclear pore
Contained within nucleus dense structure composed called
The contains nucleolar organizer part chromosome ribosome synthesis
The nucleolus help synthesize assembling ribosomal RNA subunit
These subunit join together form ribosome protein synthesis
The nucleus regulates synthesis cytoplasm use messenger RNA mRNA
Messenger RNA transcribed DNA segment serf template protein production
It produced nucleus travel cytoplasm nuclear pore nuclear envelope
Once cytoplasm ribosome another RNA molecule called work together mRNA produce protein
The cell nucleus one type cell
The following cell structure also found typical animal eukaryotic cell There error

There hundred different type cell inside body
They different shape role keeping healthy growing every cell inside one thing common Each nucleus
Much like brain control center cell
It help cell move absorb nutrient reproduce create new cell
In general located middle cell surrounded fluid fill empty space cell giving shape keeping everything place
Here core cell nucleus easily direct function happening around
It important note cell nucleus
Some simple organism tiny bacteria nucleus
The complex cell like inside human animal plant nucleus
The nucleus may small complex many part
Let explore part
Since nucleus important need protected
And protected nuclear membrane made two layer inner outer membrane
Th nuclear membrane act like cushiony outer shell much like helmet wear protect head riding bike
The nuclear membrane covered tiny hole called nuclear pore
They allow different cellular material come go cell
Nuclear pore picky
Think like ticket collector movie theater
They allow people ticket movie anyone without ticket turned away door
When get past nuclear membrane find nucleoplasm
The nucleoplasm lot like cytoplasm outside nucleus fluid hold thing place give shape
Nucleoplasm also help transport essential material throughout nucleus Get FREE access day create account
In middle nucleus nucleolus sometimes two
The main job nucleolus make special kind ribonucleic acid also called RNA
This RNA turn around make protein essential life
The nucleolus also help assemble ribosome combination made protein RNA
These ribosome exit nucleus nuclear pore produce protein throughout cell
Chromatin structure inside nucleus look lot like squiggly line
These made protein dioxyribonucleic acid better known DNA
DNA helix look like ladder twisted end
It important material hold code cell body
When cell get ready reproduce chromatin wind compact structure call chromosome
When compact little package DNA passed new cell easily
The nucleus cell like brain helping cell move absorb nutrient create new cell
It made many part including nuclear membrane pore nucleoplasm nucleolus chromatin

In chemistry nucleus positively charged center consisting
It also known atomic nucleus
The word nucleus come Latin word form word mean nut kernel
The term coined Michael Faraday describe center atom
The science involved study nucleus composition characteristic called nuclear physic nuclear chemistry
Protons neutron held together
Electrons although attracted nucleus move fast fall around orbit distance
The positive electrical charge nucleus come proton neutron net electrical charge
Nearly mass atom contained within nucleus since proton neutron much mass electron
The number proton atomic nucleus defines identity atom specific element
The number neutron determines isotope element atom
The nucleus atom much smaller overall diameter atom electron distant atom center
A hydrogen atom time larger nucleus uranium atom around time larger nucleus
The hydrogen nucleus smallest nucleus consists lone proton
It femtometer x
The uranium atom contrast contains many proton neutron
Its nucleus femtometer
The proton neutron usually depicted compacted together evenly spaced sphere
However oversimplification actual structure
Each nucleon proton neutron occupy certain energy level range location
While nucleus spherical may also rugby triaxial
The proton neutron nucleus baryon called quark
The strong force extremely short range proton neutron must near bound
The attractive strong force overcomes natural repulsion proton
In addition proton neutron third type baryon called hyperon
A hyperon contains least one strange quark proton neutron consist quark
A nucleus contains proton neutron called hypernucleus
This type atomic nucleus seen nature formed physic experiment
Another type atomic nucleus halo nucleus
This core nucleus surrounded orbiting halo proton neutron
A halo nucleus much larger diameter typical nucleus
Its also much unstable normal nucleus
An example halo nucleus observed core consisting neutron proton halo independent neutron
The nucleus millisecond
Several nuclides seen halo nucleus excited state ground state

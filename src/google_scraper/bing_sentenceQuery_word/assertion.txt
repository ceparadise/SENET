expected always true point code
If assertion evaluates false run time assertion failure result typically cause program throw assertion
The following code contains two assertion indeed true indicated point execution Programmers use assertion help specify program reason program correctness
For example assertion placed beginning section set state programmer expects code execute
A expected state end execution
For example
The example us notation including assertion used article
That notation used existing mainstream programming language
However programmer include unchecked assertion using programming language
For example The brace included comment help distinguish use comment us
Libraries may provide assertion feature well
For example C using glibc support Several modern programming language include checked assertion checked sometimes statically
If assertion evaluates false runtime assertion failure result typically cause execution abort
This draw attention location logical inconsistency detected preferable behaviour would otherwise result
The use assertion help programmer design develop reason program
In language assertion form part design process language use check assumption runtime
In case checked validity runtime usually also suppressed
Assertions function form documentation describe state code expects find run state code expects result finished running also specify
integrates assertion language automatically extract document class
This form important part method
This approach also useful language explicitly support advantage using assertion statement rather assertion program check assertion every time run assertion longer hold error reported
This prevents code getting sync assertion
An assertion may used verify assumption made programmer implementation program remains valid program executed
For example consider following code In operator Java first operand negative result also negative unlike modulo used mathematics
Here programmer assumed remainder division always
The assertion make assumption explicit return negative value program may bug
A major advantage technique error occur detected immediately directly rather later often obscure
Since assertion failure usually report code location one often error without debugging
Assertions also sometimes placed point execution supposed reach
For example assertion could placed clause statement language
Any case programmer handle intentionally raise error program abort rather silently continuing erroneous state
In assertion added automatically statement contain clause
In assertion part language since version
Assertion failure result raising program run appropriate flag without assert statement ignored
In added standard header defining macro signal error case failure usually terminating program
In header provide macro
The danger assertion may cause side effect either changing memory data changing thread timing
Assertions implemented carefully cause side effect program code
Assertion construct language allow easy TDD without use library
During programmer typically run program assertion enabled
When assertion failure occurs programmer immediately notified problem
Many assertion implementation also halt program execution useful since program continued run assertion violation occurred might corrupt state make cause problem difficult locate
Using information provided assertion failure location failure perhaps even full program state environment support program running programmer usually fix problem
Thus assertion provide powerful tool debugging
When program deployed assertion typically turned avoid overhead side effect may
In case assertion completely absent deployed code assertion via macro
In case Java assertion present deployed code turned field debugging
Assertions may also used promise compiler given edge condition actually reachable thereby permitting certain would otherwise possible
In case disabling assertion could actually reduce performance
Assertions checked compile time called static assertion
Static assertion particularly useful compile time also used language like C introducing illegal code assertion fails
support static assertion directly
In earlier C version static assertion implemented example like If part evaluates false code compile compiler allow two constant
The boolean expression must constant value example would valid expression context
This construct work file scope
inside function must wrapped inside function
Another popular way implementing assertion C If part evaluates false code compile array may negative length
If fact compiler allows negative length initialization byte part cause even compiler complain
The boolean expression must constant value example would valid expression context
Both method require method constructing unique name
Modern compiler support preprocessor define facilitates construction unique name returning monotonically increasing number compilation unit
provides static assertion use
Most language allow assertion enabled disabled globally sometimes independently
Assertions often enabled development disabled final testing release customer
Not checking assertion avoids cost evaluating assertion assuming assertion free still producing result normal condition
Under abnormal condition disabling assertion checking mean program would aborted continue run
This sometimes preferable
Some language including completely remove assertion compile time using
Java requires option passed engine order enable assertion
Absent option assertion bypassed always remain code unless optimised away JIT compiler excluded false condition compile time thus need space time cost Java either
Programmers build check code always active bypassing manipulating language normal mechanism
Assertions distinct routine
Assertions document logically impossible situation discover programming error impossible occurs something fundamental clearly wrong program
This distinct error handling error condition possible although may extremely unlikely occur practice
Using assertion error handling mechanism unwise assertion allow recovery error assertion failure normally halt program execution abruptly assertion often disabled production code
Assertions also display error message
Consider following example using assertion handle error Here programmer aware return memory allocated
This possible operating system guarantee every call succeed
If memory error occurs program immediately abort
Without assertion program would continue running dereferenced possibly longer depending specific hardware used
So long assertion disabled immediate exit assured
But graceful failure desired program handle failure
For example server may multiple client may hold resource released cleanly may uncommitted change write datastore
In case better fail single transaction abort abruptly
Another error rely side effect expression used argument assertion
One always keep mind assertion might executed since sole purpose verify condition always true fact hold true
Consequently program considered released assertion may disabled longer evaluated
Consider another version previous example This might look like smart way assign return value check one step call assignment side effect evaluating expression form condition
When parameter passed compiler program considered released statement removed called rendering uninitialised
This could potentially result similar error much line program execution causing bug may difficult track
Programmers sometimes use similar VERIFY X define alleviate problem
Modern compiler may issue warning encountering code
In report design described algorithm using early version included assertion It may true whenever C actually reach certain point flow diagram one bound variable necessarily posse certain specified value posse certain property satisfy certain property
Furthermore may point indicate validity limitation
For reason denote area validity limitation asserted special box call assertion box
The assertional method proving correctness program advocated
In talk Checking Large Routine Cambridge June Turing suggested How one check large routine sense making sure right
In order man check may difficult task programmer make number definite checked individually correctness whole program easily follows

In condition relied upon true execution program portion
It held always true certain phase execution
For example condition true beginning end every execution loop
Invariants especially useful reasoning whether computer program correct
The theory methodology determining rely heavily invariant
Programmers often use code make invariant explicit
Some special syntax specifying
The good example logical problem determining invariant useful
The puzzle asks one start word MI transform word MU using step one following transformation rule An example derivation superscript indicating applied rule Is possible convert MI MU using four transformation rule
One could spend many hour applying transformation rule string
However might quicker find invariant rule
changed demonstrates getting MU impossible
Logically looking puzzle way get rid I three consecutive I string
This make following invariant interesting consider This invariant problem transformation rule following hold invariant held applying rule also hold applying
If look net effect applying rule number I U see actually case rule The table show clearly invariant hold possible transformation rule basically mean whichever rule pick whatever state number I multiple three applying rule wo afterwards either
Given single I starting string MI one multiple three impossible go MI MU zero multiple three
tool compute simple invariant given imperative computer program
The kind property found depend used
Typical example property single integer variable range like relation several variable like modulus information like
Academic research prototype also consider simple property pointer structure
Any sophisticated invariant still provided manually
In particular verifying imperative program using Hoare calculus loop invariant provided manually loop program one reason task extremely tedious
In example tool able detect rule derivation MI MU impossible
However abstraction string number I made hand leading
following C program abstract interpretation tool able detect ca hence never terminate

Just simple question assertion
I heard statement assertion appropriately used precondition check method appropriate method
Why
please help thanks It explains
It sound like public method go used another class even another coder used alot outside general scope class
Asserts generally run runtime afaik specify runtime want enabled
This great debugging finished still need public method check validity parameter passed even outside debugging another class even another coder might pas value unacceptable whereas private protected method passed parameter within class least limited scope control parameter passed assertion argument valid hold true long check make sure anything might change outside ie passed public method valid

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

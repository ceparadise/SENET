plural accurate one first technique
It developed late study problem might arise malfunction military system
An FMEA often first step system reliability study
It involves reviewing many component assembly subsystem possible identify failure mode cause effect
For component failure mode resulting effect rest system recorded specific FMEA worksheet
There numerous variation worksheet
An FMEA qualitative analysis may put quantitative basis mathematical model combined statistical failure mode ratio database
A different type FMEA analysis exist Sometimes FMEA extended failure mode effect criticality analysis indicate criticality analysis performed
FMEA forward logic single point failure analysis core task
A successful FMEA activity help identify potential failure mode based experience similar product based common physic failure logic
It widely used development manufacturing industry various phase product life cycle
refers studying consequence failure different system level
Functional analysis needed input determine correct failure mode system level functional FMEA hardware FMEA
An FMEA used structure Mitigation Risk reduction based either failure mode effect severity reduction based lowering probability failure
The FMEA principle full inductive forward logic analysis however failure probability estimated reduced understanding
Ideally probability shall lowered impossible occur eliminating
It therefore important include FMEA appropriate depth information cause failure deductive analysis
The FME C A design tool used systematically analyze postulated component failure identify resultant effect system operation
The analysis sometimes characterized consisting two first failure mode effect analysis FMEA second criticality analysis CA
Successful development FMEA requires analyst include significant failure mode contributing element part system
FMEAs performed system subsystem assembly subassembly part level
The living document development hardware design
It scheduled completed concurrently design
If completed timely manner FMECA help guide design decision
The usefulness FMECA design tool process dependent effectiveness timeliness design problem identified
Timeliness probably important consideration
In extreme case FMECA would little value design decision process analysis performed hardware built
While FMECA identifies part failure mode primary benefit early identification critical catastrophic subsystem system failure mode eliminated minimized design modification earliest point development effort therefore FMECA performed system level soon preliminary design information available extended lower level detail design progress
Remark For complete scenario modelling another type Reliability analysis may considered example FTA backward logic failure analysis may handle multiple failure within item external item including maintenance logistics
It start higher functional system level
A FTA may use basic failure mode FMEA record effect summary one input basic event
Interface hazard analysis Human error analysis others may added completion scenario modelling
The analysis may performed functional level design matured sufficiently identify specific hardware perform function analysis extended hardware level
When performing hardware level interfacing hardware considered operating within specification
In addition part failure postulated considered failure system single failure analysis
In addition FMEAs done system evaluate impact lower level failure system operation several FMEAs done
Special attention paid interface system fact functional interface
The purpose FMEAs assure irreversible physical functional damage propagated across interface result failure one interfacing unit
These analysis done piece part level circuit directly interface unit
The FMEA accomplished without CA CA requires FMEA previously identified system level critical failure
When step done total process called
The ground rule FMEA include set project selected procedure assumption analysis based hardware included excluded analysis rationale exclusion
The ground rule also describe indenture level analysis basic hardware status criterion system mission success
Every effort made define ground rule FMEA begin however ground rule may expanded clarified analysis proceeds
A typical set ground rule assumption follows Major benefit derived properly implemented effort follows From list early identification SFPS input troubleshooting procedure locating performance monitoring fault detection device probably important benefit FMECA
In addition FMECA procedure straightforward allow orderly evaluation design
Procedures conducting described US Armed Forces Military Procedures document revised

The method supported provides detailed guide applying method
The standard Failure Modes Effects Analysis FMEA Failure Modes Effects Criticality Analysis FMECA procedure identify product failure mechanism may model without specialized software
This limit applicability provide meaningful input critical procedure virtual qualification root cause analysis accelerated test program remaining life assessment
To overcome shortcoming FMEA FMECA Failure Modes Mechanisms Effect Analysis FMMEA often used
The following cover basic FMEA terminology
It necessary look cause failure mode likelihood occurrence
This done analysis calculation FEM looking similar item process failure mode documented past
A failure cause looked upon design weakness
All potential cause failure mode identified documented
This technical term
Examples cause Human error handling Manufacturing induced fault Fatigue Creep Abrasive wear erroneous algorithm excessive voltage improper operating condition use depending used ground rule
A failure mode given
Determine Severity scenario adverse end effect state
It convenient write effect term user might see experience term functional failure
Examples end effect full loss function x degraded performance function reversed mode late functioning erratic functioning etc
Each end effect given Severity number S say I effect V catastrophic based cost loss life quality life
These number prioritize failure mode together probability detectability
Below typical classification given
Other classification possible

For example If undetected failure allows system remain working state second failure situation explored determine whether indication evident corrective action may take
Indications operator described follows PERFORM DETECTION COVERAGE ANALYSIS FOR TEST PROCESSES AND MONITORING From Standard This type analysis useful determine effective various test process detection latent dormant fault
The method used accomplish involves examination applicable failure mode determine whether effect detected determine percentage failure rate applicable failure mode detected
The possibility detection mean may fail latent accounted coverage analysis limiting factor coverage reliable detection mean availability
Inclusion detection coverage FMEA lead individual failure would one effect category separate effect category due detection coverage possibility
Another way include detection coverage FTA conservatively assume hole coverage due latent failure detection method affect detection failure assigned failure effect category concern
The FMEA revised necessary case conservative assumption allow top event probability requirement met
After three basic step Risk level may provided
probability severity includes effect
This may influence end effect probability failure worst case effect Severity
The exact calculation may easy case multiple scenario multiple event possible detectability dormancy play crucial role redundant system

The higher Risk level justification mitigation needed provide evidence lower risk acceptable level
High risk indicated higher level management responsible final
A simple FMEA created easily Excel
However Excel designed handle relation structure document FMEA
Each process many requirement requirement many potential failure mode
A big project even much complicated
FMEA software come play handle activity
Below list FMEA software
The FMEA updated whenever While FMEA identifies important hazard system result may comprehensive approach limitation
In healthcare context FMEA risk assessment method including SWIFT retrospective approach found limited validity used isolation
Challenges around scoping organisational boundary appear major factor lack validity
If used tool FMEA may identify major failure mode system
better suited analysis
When used tool FMEA augment complement FTA identify many cause failure mode resulting symptom
It able discover complex failure mode involving multiple failure within subsystem report expected failure interval particular failure mode upper level subsystem system
Additionally multiplication severity occurrence detection ranking may result rank reversal le serious failure mode receives higher RPN serious failure mode
The reason ranking number multiplication defined ordinal number
The ordinal ranking say one ranking better worse another much
For instance ranking may twice severe ranking may twice severe multiplication treat though
See discussion
Various solution problem proposed use alternative classic RPN model
The use RPN threshold upon take action limit effectiveness FMEA
Historically corrective action based FMEA prioritized based RPN
However model lead negative team behavior team select lowest number get threshold actual risk requiring mitigation
Process FMEA challenging participant completed many PFMEAS often confusing FAILURE MODES EFFECTS CAUSES
To clarify Process FMEA show process go wrong
Using detailed Process Map aid person filling worksheet correctly list step process reviewed
The FAILURE MODE simply step go wrong
Example Process Step
Pick Up right handed part
Can pick wrong part
manufacturing center left right handed part etc
FAILURE MODE put left hand part EFFECT could wrecked CNC machine scrapped part hole drilled wrong location
The cause keeping inventory similar part job
Why important PFMEA regard process
When process examined ask go wrong process unknown issue uncovered solving problem occur tackling root cause issue least Y deep Y
Here manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke tooling prevent left handed part fixture running right handed part program touch probe CNC programming ever making mistake first time
If PFMEA set FAILURE MODE relates feature print example FAILURE MODE drilled hole big understanding caused problem gained
Numerous PFMEA examined show little value gained reviewing feature print FAILURE MODES little understanding cause gained
New PFMEA practitioner often try relate PFMEA FAILURE MODE FEATURE numerous author list trying inspect quality rather listing process step determining go wrong building quality root cause evaluation
Besides two shortcoming The FMEA worksheet hard produce hard understand read well hard maintain
The use neural network technique cluster visualise failure mode suggested recently

Later may lead unforeseen problem hand clinical user
These pitfall avoided using process known Failure Mode Effects Analysis FMEA
FMEA ongoing quality improvement process carried healthcare organization multidisciplinary team
It employed examine use new product design new service process determine point potential failure effect would
In regard FMEA differs Root Cause Analysis RCA
RCA process employed error occurs identify underlying cause
In contrast FMEA process used look carefully systematically vulnerable area process
FMEA employed purchase implementation new service process product identify potential failure mode step taken avoid error occur
How FMEA used reduce risk medication error
To cite one example multidisciplinary committee could use FMEA ass new drug considered formulary
Here process would work
The committee would explore intended product would procured used acquisition administration
Who would prescribe drug type patient
Where would drug stored
Who would prepare dispense
How would administered
Potential failure mode system process may fail would identified considering product would used
Could drug mistaken another similarly packaged product
Does label clearly express strength concentration
Does name sound look like another drug formulary
Are dosing parameter complex
Is administration process error prone
Once failure mode identified staff would determine likelihood mistake occurring potential consequence error
What would happen patient drug given wrong dose wrong time wrong patient wrong route wrong rate wrong time
Staff would identify preexisting process place could help detect error reach patient evaluate effectiveness based upon knowledge human factor
If failure mode could cause error significant consequence action would taken prevent error detect reach patient minimize consequence
A example include using alternative product preparing drug pharmacy standardizing drug concentration order communication dosing method using auxiliary warning label computer alert requiring entry specific data computer system processing order
Although industry outside medicine developed elaborate FMEA scoring system rank item action simplified FMEA process described efficient proactive risk management tool especially organization consider already known error potential past experience information available medium newsletter

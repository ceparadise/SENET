Every internal system component resource
Virtual system resource include concretely network connection concretely memory area
Managing resource referred includes preventing releasing resource process finished using dealing multiple process wish access limited resource
Some resource notably memory storage space notion location one distinguish allocation allocation
For example allocating GiB memory single block versus allocating block size MiB
The latter known often severely impact performance free space subcategory general resource storage space
One also distinguish resource resource
Compressible resource generally throughput one CPU network bandwidth throttled benignly user slowed proportionally throttling otherwise proceed normally
Other resource generally storage one memory throttled without either causing failure process allocate enough memory typically run severe performance degradation due working set fit memory requires frequent paging progress slow significantly
The distinction always sharp mentioned paging system allow main memory primary storage compressed paging hard drive secondary storage system allow cache compressible without disastrous performance impact
Electrical power degree compressible without power without sufficient voltage electrical device run stop crash device notably mobile phone allow degraded operation reduced power consumption allow device suspended terminated much lower power consumption

We discus open source software basic behind Open Source Initiative OSI Free Software Licensing
refers program software form program programmer writes program particular programming language available general public use modification original design free charge
Open source code typically created collaborative effort programmer improve upon code share change within community
The rationale movement larger group concerned proprietary ownership financial gain produce useful product everyone use
The concept relies peer review find eliminate program code process commercially developed packaged employ
The basic behind Open Source Initiative programmer read redistribute modify source code piece software evolves
Open source sprouted technological community response proprietary software owned corporation
Proprietary software privately owned controlled
In computer industry proprietary considered opposite open
A proprietary design technique one owned company
It also implies company divulged specification would allow company duplicate product
Open Source certification standard issued OSI indicates source code computer program made available free charge general public
OSI dictate order considered OSI Certified product must meet following criterion Open source software normally distributed source code open source license
The Open Source Initiative set following distribution term software must comply Open source mean access source code
The distribution term software must comply following criterion The license shall restrict party selling giving away software component aggregate software distribution containing program several different source
The license shall require royalty fee sale
The program must include source code must allow distribution source code well compiled form
Where form product distributed source code must mean obtaining source code reasonable reproduction cost preferably downloading via Internet without charge
The source code must preferred form programmer would modify program
Deliberately obfuscated source code allowed
Intermediate form output preprocessor translator allowed The license must allow modification derived work must allow distributed term license original software
The license may restrict distributed modified form license allows distribution patch file source code purpose modifying program build time
The license must explicitly permit distribution software built modified source code
The license may require derived work carry different name version number original software
The license must discriminate person group person
The license must restrict anyone making use program specific field endeavor
For example may restrict program used business used genetic research
The right attached program must apply program redistributed without need execution additional license party
The right attached program must depend program part particular software distribution
If program extracted distribution used distributed within term program license party program redistributed right granted conjunction original software distribution
The license must place restriction software distributed along licensed software
For example license must insist program distributed medium must software
No provision license may predicated individual technology style interface
All open source software distributed licensing agreement
Some may use free software license copyleft GPL compatible
The GNU GPL license free software license copyleft license GNU Lesser General Public License free software license strong copyleft license
There many different type license free software
GNU GPL compatible
The Open Source Initiative approves open source license successfully gone approval process comply Open Source Definition
There currently well fifty license approved OSI
For example GNU General Public License GPL one license accompanies open source software detail software accompany source code freely copied distributed modified
The widespread use GPL reference GNU GPL commonly abbreviated simply GPL understood term refers GNU GPL
One basic tenet GPL anyone acquires material must make available anyone else licensing agreement
The GPL cover activity copying distributing modifying source code
Other open source license include following A software programmer really reason contributing open source project
Some may looking fun challenge others looking improve skill build programming ability may want belong group project
In many instance opportunity make money open source project funded government corporate sponsor
Unlike commercial project open source project allow programmer name known benefit programmer name portfolio lead future job funded open source commercial project
The hype benefit open source gone unnoticed commercial world corporation jumped open source bandwagon
Since commercial software sold profit one may wonder company would interested open source project
In many case company able profit selling tool module paid consulting service technical support program
Sendmail open source mail transfer agent MTA used routing delivery

I heard thing like C Runtime Visual Runtime Common Language Runtime etc
When coding assembly language Linux I could use INT instruction make system call
So runtime nothing bunch function wrap low level function abstract high level function
But seem like definition library runtime
Are runtime two different thing
These day I thinking maybe something common called JVM
Here quotation lead thought This compilation process sufficiently complex broken several layer abstraction usually involve three translator compiler virtual machine implementation assembler
Introduction The Road Down To Hardware Land As per Wikipedia
In computer programming runtime library special program library used compiler implement function built programming language runtime execution computer program
This often includes function input output memory management
A system also called runtime system runtime software designed support execution computer program written computer language
The system contains implementation basic command may also implement command may support type checking debugging even code generation optimization
Some service system accessible programmer application programming interface service task scheduling resource management may inaccessible
runtime runtime library two different name thing
Runtime describes executed program running especially instruction write explicitly necessary proper execution code
language like C small runtime
More complex language like allows dynamic message passing much extensive runtime
You correct runtime code library code library code general term describing code produced library
Runtime code specifically code required implement feature language
Runtime general term refers library framework platform code run
The C runtimes collection function
The runtime contains interpreter garbage collector
The part language implementation executes code present part implementation called C standard
Java runtime consists virtual machine standard library common C runtime consists loader part operating system runtime library implement part C language built executable compiler hosted environment includes part standard library In understanding exactly mean time program run
You say something happens compile time
I think two separate thing
C runtime seem right
I call C runtime library
Answers question I think term extended include also environment context program run This answer extend opinion fact definition
Matt Ball answered correctly
I would say example
Consider running program compiled version year compiler let run version window like Win etc
Its bit compiler
And see program bit pointer
Why OS
Yeah
compiler setup execution environment bit bit version OS supported
What commonly called JRE Java Runtime Environment provides Java program resource may need execute
Actually runtime environment brain product idea Virtual Machines
A virtual machine implement raw interface hardware program may need execute
The runtime environment adopts interface present use programmer
A compiler developer would need facility provide execution environment program
Run time exactly code come life see lot important thing code
Runtime responsibility allocating memory freeing memory using operating system sub system like File Services IO Network Services etc
Your code called WORKING IN THEORY practically run code
Runtime friend help achiving
I found make insightful context understanding You see Development Kit eg
stuff get run runtime
It content like The zip contains So eg
C runtime would file like C runtime library run runtime made special content purpose inclusion definition C language implemented C implementation choice
And get runtime implementation use build upon
That little polarisation runnable file user new program need
As developer program need C compiler C library header user need
runtime could denote current phase program life runtime compile time load time link time could mean runtime library form basic low level action interface execution environment
could mean runtime system execution environment
case C program runtime code set stack heap etc
requirement expected C environment
essentially set environment promised language
could runtime library component something like case C Run time instance know type object creates execution object creation based certain condition computation work
In contradict compile time instance required object defined execution
These section MSDN documentation deal question I hope help
Thanks Damian Runtime somewhat opposite
Historically come slow mainframe environment expensive
Runtime period time program running
It begin program opened executed end program quit closed
Runtime technical term used often software development
It commonly seen context runtime error error occurs program running
The term runtime error used distinguish type error syntax error compiliation error occur program run
When program runtime phase application loaded RAM
This includes executable file library framework file referenced program
When program quit runtime period end memory used program made available use program
Time elapsed execution program
But general
Say duration compilation program OS presenting recipe programmer interact see outcome developed called runtime
No syntax error etc presented runtime

logic correct technically business perspetcive
So way say compileTime primary level runtime secondary level

In measure estimate time taken running
Time complexity commonly estimated counting number elementary operation performed algorithm supposing elementary operation take fixed amount time perform
Thus amount time taken number elementary operation performed algorithm differ
Since algorithm running time may vary different input size one commonly considers maximum amount time taken input given size
Less common usually specified explicitly average time taken input given size make sense finite number possible input given size
In case time complexity generally expressed size input
Since function generally difficult compute exactly running time usually critical small input one focus commonly behavior complexity input size increase complexity
Therefore time complexity commonly expressed using typically input size measured number needed representing
Algorithm complexity classified function appearing big O notation
For example algorithm time complexity algorithm time complexity constant
The following table summarizes class commonly encountered time complexity
In table poly polynomial
An algorithm said also written time value bounded value depend size input
For example accessing single element take constant time one performed locate
In similar manner finding minimal value array sorted ascending order first element
However finding minimal value unordered array constant time operation scanning array needed order determine minimal value
Hence linear time operation taking O n time
If number element known advance change however algorithm still said run constant time
Despite name constant time running time independent problem size upper bound running time bounded independently problem size
For example task exchange value necessary called constant time even though time may depend whether already true
However constant time required always
Here example code fragment run constant time If O equivalent stated standard notation O
An algorithm said take
Due use computer frequently base log sometimes written lg
However logarithm log log differ constant multiplier notation discarded thus O log standard notation logarithmic time algorithm regardless base logarithm
Algorithms taking logarithmic time commonly found operation using
An O log n algorithm considered highly efficient ratio number operation size input decrease tends zero increase
An algorithm must access element input take logarithmic time time taken reading input size order
An example logarithmic time given dictionary search
Let u consider contains entry sorted
We suppose one may access th entry dictionary constant time
Let denotes th entry
Under hypothesis test word dictionary may done logarithmic time consider denotes
If done
Else continue search way left half dictionary otherwise continue similarly half part dictionary
This algorithm similar method often used find entry paper dictionary
An algorithm said run O log constant
For example solved polylogarithmic time
An algorithm said run often spelled
In particular includes algorithm time complexity defined well others O algorithm
Typical algorithm exact yet run time use NC matrix determinant calculation Grover search alternatively guaranteed assumption input structure logarithmic time many tree maintenance algorithm
However set string position indicated first log n bit string may depend every bit input yet computable time
The specific term usually reserved algorithm unlike run classical serial machine model allowed prior assumption input
They however allowed indeed must randomized trivial task
As algorithm must provide answer without reading entire input particular heavily depend access allowed input
Usually input represented binary string assumed algorithm time O request obtain value
time algorithm typically randomized provide solution
In fact property binary string zero one easily proved decidable time algorithm
time algorithm arise naturally investigation
An algorithm said take time time complexity O
Informally mean large enough input size running time increase linearly size input
For example procedure add element list requires time proportional length list
This description slightly inaccurate since running time significantly deviate precise proportionality especially small value
Linear time best possible time complexity situation algorithm sequentially read entire input
Therefore much research invested discovering algorithm exhibiting linear time least nearly linear time
This research includes software hardware method
There several hardware technology exploit provide
An example
This concept linear time used string matching algorithm
An algorithm said run quasilinear time also referred time positive constant linearithmic time case
Using algorithm Õ
Quasilinear time algorithm also O every constant ε thus run faster polynomial time algorithm whose time bound includes term
Algorithms run quasilinear time include In many case log running time simply result performing Θ log operation time
For example creates inserting element array one one
Since insert operation take log time entire algorithm take log time
require least log number comparison worst case log
Θ log
They also frequently arise
An said
For example simple quadratic
advanced algorithm found subquadratic

No sort run linear time change quadratic great practical importance
An algorithm said running time size input algorithm O constant
deterministic polynomial time algorithm exists belong central field
state polynomial time synonym tractable feasible efficient fast
Some example polynomial time algorithm In context especially one differentiates algorithm
These two concept relevant input algorithm consist integer
Strongly polynomial time defined arithmetic model computation
In model computation basic arithmetic operation addition subtraction multiplication division comparison take unit time step perform regardless size operand
The algorithm run strongly polynomial time Any algorithm two property converted polynomial time algorithm replacing arithmetic operation suitable algorithm performing arithmetic operation
If second requirement met true anymore
Given integer take space proportional n Turing machine model possible compute n multiplication using
However space used represent proportional thus exponential rather polynomial space used represent input
Hence possible carry computation polynomial time Turing machine possible compute polynomially many arithmetic operation
Conversely algorithm run number Turing machine step bounded polynomial length input take number arithmetic operation bounded polynomial number input number
The computing two integer one example
Given two integer running time algorithm bounded number Turing machine step polynomial size binary representation
At time number arithmetic operation bounded number integer input constant case always two integer input
Due latter observation algorithm run strongly polynomial time
Its real running time depends magnitude number integer input
An algorithm run polynomial time strongly polynomial said run
A example problem weakly algorithm known known admit strongly algorithm
Weakly confused
The concept polynomial time lead several complexity class computational complexity theory
Some important class defined using polynomial time following
P smallest class deterministic machine term machine model change
For example change Turing machine machine lead quadratic speedup algorithm run polynomial time one model also
Any given complexity class corresponding problem solved polynomial time machine
An algorithm said take bounded polynomial
It ω time constant input parameter typically number bit input
For example algorithm run step input size requires superpolynomial time specifically exponential time
An algorithm us exponential resource clearly superpolynomial algorithm weakly superpolynomial
For example run time input grows faster polynomial large enough input size must become impractically large dominated polynomial small degree
An algorithm requires superpolynomial time lie outside
posit algorithm impractical many case
Since unresolved algorithm problem currently known run polynomial time
algorithm algorithm run slower polynomial time yet slow exponential time
The worst case running time time algorithm fixed
If constant c definition time algorithm equal get polynomial time algorithm le get time algorithm
time algorithm typically arise problem another problem
For example one take instance NP hard problem say convert instance another problem B size instance becomes
In case reduction prove problem B reduction show polynomial time algorithm B unless time algorithm thus
Similarly problem know time algorithm polynomial time algorithm known
Such problem arise approximation algorithm famous example directed time approximation algorithm achieving approximation factor n number vertex showing existence polynomial time algorithm open problem
Other computational problem time solution known polynomial time solution include problem goal union clique
Although solvable conjectured planted clique problem polynomial time solution planted clique conjecture used prove difficulty several problem computational
The complexity class consists problem time algorithm
It defined term follows
In complexity theory unsolved problem asks problem NP algorithm
All algorithm problem like etc
take exponential time
Indeed conjectured many natural problem time algorithm
Here time taken mean second definition presented
On hand many graph problem represented natural way adjacency matrix solvable subexponential time simply size input square number vertex
This conjecture problem known
Since conjectured problem time algorithm inapproximability result field make assumption problem time algorithm
For example see known inapproximability result problem
The term used express running time algorithm may grow faster polynomial still significantly smaller exponential
In sense problem time algorithm somewhat tractable exponential algorithm
The precise definition generally agreed upon list two widely used one
A problem said time solvable solved running time whose logarithm grow smaller given polynomial
More precisely problem time every ε exists algorithm solves problem time O
The set problem complexity class defined term follows
Note notion term ε sense ε part input ε may algorithm problem
Some author define time running time
This definition allows larger running time first definition time
An example time algorithm classical algorithm integer factorization run time length input
Another example algorithm run time
Note make difference whether algorithm allowed size instance number vertex number edge
In difference made explicit considering pair parameter
class parameterized problem run time polynomial input size More precisely SUBEPT class parameterized problem algorithm decides time
The satisfiability problem Boolean formula three literal per clause variable solved time
More precisely hypothesis absolute constant decided time deterministic Turing machine
With denoting number clause ETH equivalent hypothesis SAT solved time integer
The exponential time hypothesis implies
An algorithm said upper bounded poly polynomial
More formally algorithm exponential time bounded O constant
Problems admit exponential time algorithm deterministic Turing machine form complexity class known
Sometimes exponential time used refer algorithm exponent linear function
This give rise complexity class
An algorithm said time upper bounded poly polynomial
Such algorithm belong complexity class
double exponential time algorithm include

As programming naturally encounter lot error
Causing understanding fixing error important part programming
Python best run anything tell run ca understand asking wo run program
All Python try tell little bit information went wrong order help try fix
Here two Python error
In first example forget use parenthesis required
Python understand trying
Here second example bug Python
In second example forget define variable
Python know want since defined error occurs
A happens Python ca understand saying
A happens Python understands saying run trouble following instruction
In English would like sentence The grammar sentence make sense
From perspective English grammar missing action
You understand asked
mean thing
In English would like sentence The sentence make sense grammatical perspective verb noun right place know asked
But encounter problem start trying eat piano except maybe termite
This called occurs program start running
We also talk end mean program run without crashing still produce wrong result
An example would This would logic error also open even though command make sense close back door actually accomplish goal keeping bug since still come front door
Here additional example syntax error occur Python
One general thing occur Python encounter special symbol place expect
Python say point exclamation point
The problem meaning Python
The syntax error would go away put instead Python would understand part text
Here another syntax error subtle
The problem special word Python
written instead class would fine
Click see list special keywords Python
If using quote around text forget second one using parenthesis forget second one get syntax error In error short nd f ine Python expected another line ended found
Similarly short nd f ile Python kept looking program file ended found
Sometimes two similar syntax error give two different error message
But every error message indeed trying tell something helpful
Here common error
Python able understand program say run problem actually performing instruction
You find way producing error learn Python
Your program might run without crashing syntax error still wrong thing
For example perhaps want program calculate two number average defined Why program work
The average program print instead
The error time order operation arithmetic

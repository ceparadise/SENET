Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In computer science technical writing especially software engineering difference fault error defect
I want quote To quote Typically word used refers defined
However different culture standard may use somewhat different meaning term led attempt define
Partial definition taken standard Error computed result correct Fault incorrect step process data definition computer Failure incorrect result Mistake human action produce incorrect Based understanding definition error result fault failure
Could someone explain clearly
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
This question came site academic enrolled higher education
According A system event occurs delivered service deviate correct service
A system may fail either comply specification specification adequately describe function
An part system state may cause subsequent failure failure occurs error reach service interface alters service
A adjudged hypothesized cause error
I understand another name fault
confusing represent fault failure depending context
With reference definition used linked article error result fault potentially cause error outside tolerance system
Most system dealing real data degree error designed tolerate

A error flaw cause produce incorrect unexpected result behave unintended way
The process fixing bug termed often us formal technique tool pinpoint bug since computer system designed also deter detect various computer bug operation
Most bug arise mistake error made either program component used program
A caused producing incorrect code
A program contains large number bug bug seriously interfere functionality said defective
Bugs trigger error may
Bugs may subtle effect cause program computer
Other bug qualify might example enable bypass order
Some software bug linked disaster
Bugs code control machine directly responsible patient death
In US billion rocket destroyed le minute launch due bug guidance computer program
In June Royal Air Force helicopter killing
This initially dismissed pilot error investigation convinced inquiry may caused software bug aircraft
In study commissioned US concluded software bug error prevalent detrimental cost US economy estimated billion annually percent gross domestic product
The term bug describe defect part engineering jargon since predates electronic computer computer software may originally used hardware engineering describe mechanical malfunction
For instance wrote following word letter associate It invention
The first step intuition come burst difficulty thing give Bugs little fault difficulty month intense watching study labor requisite commercial success failure certainly reached
The Middle English word basis term term used monster
first mechanical game advertised free bug
Problems military gear referred bug
In book published speaking powered machine said Ice sawing suspended creator could brought take bug darling
used term bug relate issue robot short story Catch That Rabbit published included collection short story
From page Catch That Rabbit Robots get bug multiple robot plenty bug always least half dozen bug left
The term bug used account computer pioneer publicized cause malfunction early electromechanical computer
A typical version story In Hopper released active duty joined Harvard Faculty Computation Laboratory continued work
Operators traced error Mark II trapped relay coining term
This bug carefully removed taped log book
Stemming first bug today call error glitch program
Hopper find bug readily acknowledged
The date log book September
The operator found including William Bill Burke later familiar engineering term amusedly kept insect notation First actual case bug found
Hopper loved recount story
This log book complete attached moth part collection Smithsonian
The related term also appears predate usage computing etymology word contains attestation context aircraft engine
The concept software might contain error date back speaks possibility program card erroneous analysing process must equally performed order furnish Analytical Engine necessary data herein may also lie possible source error
Granted actual mechanism unerring process may give wrong order
The Open Technology Institute run group New America released report Bugs System August stating policymakers make reform help researcher identify address software bug
The report highlight need reform field software vulnerability discovery disclosure
One report author said Congress done enough address cyber software vulnerability even though Congress passed number bill combat larger issue cyber security
Government researcher company cyber security expert people typically discover software flaw
The report call reforming computer crime copyright law
The Computer Fraud Abuse Act Digital Millennium Copyright Act Electronic Communications Privacy Act criminalize create civil penalty action security researcher routinely engage conducting legitimate security research report said
There ongoing debate use term bug describe software error
One argument word bug divorced sense human caused problem instead implies defect arose leading push abandon term bug favor term defect limited success
Since somewhat humorously suggested use term blunder
In software engineering Greek change form refers evolution defect final stage software deployment
Transformation mistake committed analyst early stage software development lifecycle lead defect final stage cycle called metamorphism
Different stage mistake entire cycle may described mistake anomaly fault failure error exception crash bug defect incident side effect
The software industry put much effort reducing bug count
These include Bugs usually appear programmer make
Various innovation designed make bug le likely easier spot
Some typo especially symbol allow program operate incorrectly others missing symbol misspelled name may prevent program operating
Compiled language reveal typo source code compiled
Several scheme assist managing programmer activity fewer bug produced
address software design issue well applies many technique prevent defect
For example formal state exact behavior program design bug may eliminated
Unfortunately formal specification impractical anything shortest program problem
involves writing test every function unit program perform
In unit test written code code considered complete test complete successfully
involves frequent software release relatively small change
Defects revealed user feedback
Open source development allows anyone examine source code
A school thought popularized say popular chance bug software given enough eyeball bug shallow
This assertion disputed however computer security specialist wrote easy hide vulnerability complex little understood undocumented source code even people reviewing code mean qualified
An example actually happening accidentally
include feature help prevent bug static restricted
For example programmer writes pseudocode although may syntactically correct code fails
Compiled language catch without run program
Interpreted language catch error runtime
Some language deliberate exclude feature easily lead bug expense slower performance general principle almost always better write simpler slower code inscrutable code run slightly faster especially considering substantial
For example support arithmetic implementation language often runtime array least debugging build
Tools help developer inspecting program text beyond compiler capability spot potential problem
Although general problem finding programming error given specification solvable see tool exploit fact human programmer tend make certain kind simple mistake often writing software
Tools monitor performance software running either specifically find problem give assurance correct working may embedded code explicitly perhaps simple statement saying provided tool
It often surprise find time taken piece code removal assumption might cause code rewritten
people whose primary task find bug write code support testing
On project resource may spent testing developing program
Measurements testing provide estimate number likely bug remaining becomes reliable longer product tested developed
Finding fixing bug major part
early computing pioneer described realization late much rest life would spent finding mistake program
Usually difficult part debugging finding bug
Once found correcting usually relatively easy
Programs known help programmer locate bug executing code line line watching variable value feature observe program behavior
Without debugger code may added message value may written console window log file trace program execution show value
However even aid debugger locating bug something art
It uncommon bug one section program cause failure completely different section thus making especially difficult track example error graphic routine causing file routine fail apparently unrelated part system
Sometimes bug isolated flaw represents error thinking planning part programmer
Such require section program overhauled rewritten
As part stepping code imagining transcribing execution process may often find error without ever reproducing bug
More typically first step locating bug reproduce reliably
Once bug reproducible programmer may use debugger tool reproducing error find point program went astray
Some bug revealed input may difficult programmer
One cause radiation machine death bug specifically occurred machine operator rapidly entered treatment plan took day practice become able bug manifest testing manufacturer attempted duplicate
Other bug may disappear program run debugger humorously named
Since particularly following disaster interest automated aid debugging rose
Some class bug nothing code
Faulty documentation hardware may lead problem system use even though code match documentation
In case change code eliminate problem even though code longer match documentation
frequently hardware bug since make new version much cheaper remanufacturing hardware especially
Bug management includes process documenting categorizing assigning reproducing correcting releasing corrected code
Proposed change software bug well enhancement request even entire release commonly tracked managed using
The item added may called defect ticket issue following paradigm story epic
Categories may objective subjective combination area software severity priority well type issue feature request bug
impact bug system operation
This impact may data loss financial loss goodwill wasted effort
Severity level standardized
Impacts differ across industry
A crash video game totally different impact crash web browser real time monitoring system
For example bug severity level might crash hang workaround meaning way customer accomplish given task workaround meaning user still accomplish task visual defect example missing image displaced button form element documentation error
Some software publisher use qualified severity critical high low blocker trivial
The severity bug may separate category priority fixing two may quantified managed separately
control bug fall list planned change
The priority decided software producer
Priorities sometimes numerical sometimes named critical high low deferred note may similar even identical severity rating looking different software producer
For example priority bug may always fixed next release bug may never fixed
Industry practice employ inverted scale highest priority low number larger number indicate lower priority
It common practice release software known bug
Most big software project maintain two list known bug known software team told user
The second list informs user bug fixed specific release may offered
Releases different kind
Bugs sufficiently high priority may warrant special release part code containing module fix
These known
Most release include mixture behavior change multiple bug fix
Releases emphasize bug fix known release
Releases emphasize feature known major release often name distinguish new feature old
Reasons software publisher opts patch even fix particular bug include In software development project mistake fault may introduced stage
Bugs arise oversight misunderstanding made software team specification design coding data entry documentation
For example relatively simple program alphabetize list word design might fail consider happen word contains
Or converting abstract design code coder might inadvertently create fail sort last word list
Errors may simple typing error intended
Another category bug called may occur program multiple component executing time
If component interact different order developer intended could interfere stop program completing task
These bug may difficult detect anticipate since may occur every execution program
Conceptual error developer misunderstanding software must
The resulting software may perform according developer understanding really needed
Other type The amount type damage software bug may cause naturally affect process policy regarding software quality
In application since software flaw potential cause human injury even death software far scrutiny quality control example online shopping website
In application banking software flaw potential cause serious financial damage bank customer quality control also important say photo editing application
NASA managed reduce number error fewer per line code felt feasible project business world
A number software bug become usually due severity example include various space military aircraft crash
Possibly famous bug also known bug feared worldwide economic collapse would happen start year result computer thinking
In end major problem occurred
The involved one incompatibility old API new API

Quantum computer may represent next major paradigm shift technology
In theory computer could perform faster complex computation using fraction energy
However practice building quantum computer tricky engineering challenge
At atomic level particle behave way one would expect law classical physic
According impossible precisely determine speed location particle given moment
Instead particle characterized wave function represents probability particle given physical state
In quantum computing instead information encoded wave function infinite variation possible spectrum wave
You lot flexibility setting value thing compute said professor University California Santa Barbara study potential quantum system
You could continuous value encoded wave function entity using fundamental unit computing
If sound
Quantum bit basic unit information representing either quantum computing qubit represent time
Over last decade researcher investigated various way designing practical implementation quantum bit qubit
None near completion
If come qubits incorporate computing architecture shown theoretically solve problem computationally currently feasible Van de Walle said
The big challenge come specific implementation qubits
One promising implementation involves defect diamond lead missing carbon material matrix rogue nitrogen atom located nearby
This altered structure creates hole vacancy called NV nitrogen vacancy center specific wave function many believe effectively manipulated quantum computing
In industry defect negative
But come material quantum computing defect make computation possible
The defect actually good actor Van de Walle said
It qubit want use unit computation
The biggest advantage NV center diamond ability operate room temperature rather requiring temperature quantum computing system
Electrons NV center also remain coherent long time manipulated outside force
You control vacancy formed crystal probe accurately laser beam specific wave length Van de Walle said
Van de Walle expert defect impurity working closely David Awschalom experimentalist UC Santa Barbara quantum computing expert expose dynamic diamond center
Van de Walle computational simulation National Science Ranger supercomputer matched experimental result NV center
The simulation also added crucial piece information NV center
In particular found defect charge state play crucial role achieving useable wavelength
This mean one must control material doping order control number electron enter vacancy
For NV center diamond optimal charge state negative one charge state Van de Walle said
For defect material may different charge state guessing charge state would able know good choice
But calculate
Simulating quantum mechanical interaction hundred atom requires thousand computer processor working tandem day
Without ability run Texas Advanced Computing Center supercomputer would simply able project Van de Walle said
The quantum simulation inspire confidence among researcher experimental collaborator generate new idea lab experiment
The ability take expertise area defect use creatively design defect certain property really great Van de Walle said
It exciting able dig know defect use knowledge construct defect given property

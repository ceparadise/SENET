In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

Computers generate random number everything cryptography video game gambling
There two category random number true random number pseudorandom number difference important security encryption system
This topic become controversial recently many people questioning whether Intel hardware random number generator chip trustworthy
To understand might trustworthy understand random number genreated first place used
Random number used many thousand year
Whether flipping coin rolling dice goal leave end result random chance
Random number generator computer similar attempt achieve unpredictable random result
Random number generator useful many different purpose
Aside obvious application like generating random number purpose gambling creating unpredictable result computer game randomness important cryptography
You may wondering computer actually generate random number
Where randomness come
If piece computer code possible number computer generates could predictable
We generally group random number computer generate two type depending generated True random number number
To generate true random number computer measure type physical phenomenon take place outside computer
For example computer could measure radioactive decay atom
According quantum theory way know sure radioactive decay occur essentially pure randomness universe
An attacker able predict radioactive decay would occur know random value
For example computer could rely atmospheric noise simply use exact time press key keyboard source unpredictable data entropy
For example computer might notice pressed key exactly second
Grab enough specific time associated key press source entropy use generate true random number
You predictable machine attacker guess precise moment press key
The generates random number block return result gather enough entropy return truly random number
Pseudorandom number alternative true random number
A computer could use seed value algorithm generate number appear random fact predictable
The computer gather random data environment
This necessarily bad thing every situation
For example playing video game really matter whether event occur game cased true random number pseudorandom number
On hand using encryption want use pseudorandom number attacker could guess
For example let say attacker know algorithm seed value pseudorandom number generator us
And let say encryption algorithm get pseudorandom number algorithm us generate encryption key without adding additional randomness
If attacker know enough could work backwards determine pseudorandom number encryption algorithm must chosen case breaking encryption
To make thing easier developer help generate secure random number Intel chip include random number generator known RdRand
This chip us entropy source processor provides random number software software request
The problem random number generator essentially black box know going inside
If RdRand contained NSA backdoor government would able break encryption key generated data supplied random number generator
This serious concern
In December FreeBSD developer removed support using RdRand directly source randomness saying trust
The output RdRand device would fed another algorithm add additional entropy ensuring backdoor random number generator matter
Linux already worked way randomizing random data coming RdRand predictable even backdoor
In recent AMA Ask Me Anything Reddit Intel CEO Brian Krzanich answer question concern
Of course likely problem Intel chip
FreeBSD developer called Via chip name
This controversy show generating random number truly random predictable important
To generate true random number random number generator gather entropy seemingly random data physical world around
For random number need random may use algorithm seed value

learn share knowledge build career
I encountered topic lately could understand needed
Can explain I use project ease life
Examples great I learn topic little
At least framed question correct perspective The usual reason using code generator given productivity consistency assume solution consistent repetitive problem throw code
I would argue time considering code generation look generating code see solve problem mean
A classic example data access could generate class table schema effectively creating table gateway solution could build something like domain model use NHibernate ActiveRecord LightSpeed pick orm map rich domain model onto database
While hand rolled solution ORM effectively code generator primary difference code generated
With ORM implicit step happens therefore nature
The hand rolled solution requires explicit step generate code development likelihood generated class need customising point therefore creating problem code
The explicit step must happen development introduces friction development process often lead code violates DRY although argue generated code never violate DRY
Another reason touting code generation come MDA MDE world Model Driven Architecture Engineering
I put much stock rather providing number poorly expressed argument I simply going someone el
IMHO code generation solution exceedingly narrow set problem whenever considering probably take second look problem trying solve see better solution
One type code generation really enhance productivity micro use macro template allow developer generate new code directly IDE tab type way placeholder eg namespace classname etc
This sort code generation feature resharper I use heavily every day
The reason benefit large scale code generation fails generated code tied back resource must kept sync therefore code generated like code solution
John Moving creation basic class IDE xml dsl often seen big bang development classic example would developer try reverse engineer database domain model
Unless code generator well written simply introduces additional burden developer every time need update domain model either update xml dsl extend domain model port change back xml dsl effectively work twice
There code generator work well space LightSpeed designer one I think atm acting engine design surface often code generator generate terrible code maintained eg winforms webforms design surface design surface therefore rapidly undo productivity benefit gained using code generator first place
Well either OR So code generator give Excellent example Damien Guard generate one separate file per class database model using best kept Visual Studio secret template thing Codesmith generator countless
Anytime need produce large amount repetetive boilerplate code code generator guy job
Last time I used code generator creating custom Data Access Layer project skeleton various CRUD action created based object model
Instead class I put together code generator using make
The advandages procedure Using GUI builder generate code common practice
Thanks need manually create widget
You drag drop use generated code
For simple widget really save time I used lot wxWidgets
Really using almost programming language using code generator except assembly machine code
I often write little script crank thousand line There also software get help generate certain type code yacc lex example used generate parser create programming language
The key think code generator input actual source code think stuff spit part build process
In case writing language fewer actual line code deal
For example long tedious file I write part work modifying game engine CRX
It take integer value defined constant two header make cvars variable console
Here short Bash script generated code Now would rather maintain
They equivalent term describe one vastly longer annoying deal
The canonical example data access I another example
I worked messaging system communicates serial port socket I found I kept write class like Try imagine writing code fewer different type message
The boring tedious code written
I managed write I decided would easier write code generator I
I wo post code lot arcane CodeDom stuff bottom line I able compact entire system single XML file How much easier
Rhetorical question
I could finally breathe
I even added bell whistle able generate proxy I could write code like In end I say saved writing good line code turned task task well plus couple day required write
A code generator useful The cost writing maintaining code generator le cost writing maintaining repetition replacing
The consistency gained using code generator reduce error degree make worthwhile
The extra problem debugging generated code make debugging inefficient enough outweigh benefit
For apps code generation great way create model data access layer
It churn entity class second case class minute
This leaf programmer focus enhancing model relationship business rule deriving view within MVC
The key thing I say model
If relying code generation maintain code real work done template
As stated Max And beware risk complexity maintaining code
If want data layer automagically created make GUI work day I suggest going geared towards application scenario
Finally keep mind garbage
If entire data layer homogeneous abstract database please please ask bothering data layer
Unless need look productive How example good use code generator
This us template code generator built visual studio generate compressed cs file Basically let define variable real inheritance even behavior style sheet create normal cs compile time
Everyone talk simple code generation code generation like MDSD DSM
This help move beyond simple generator code generation concept problem domain
It productive project even development introduces additional discipline better understanding employed solution usually better evolution path
Like OOP provided increase abstraction generating large quantity assembly code based higher level specification development allows u increase abstraction level yet another gain productivity
MetaCase mature ABSE Isomeris project alpha info two technology forefront code generation
What needed really change mindset like OOP required
I actually adding finishing touch code generator I using project I hired
We huge XML file definition day worth work I able generate C class
If I want add functionality class say I want add attribute property
I add hit go bam
I done
It really nice really
There many us code generation
Writing code familiar language generating code different target language
Writing code higher level abstraction
Automating repetitive task
Ignoring preconceived notion basically translating one representation usually higher level another usually lower level
Keeping definition mind powerful tool
The current state programming language mean reached full potential never
We always abstracting get higher level stand today
Code generation get u
We either depend language creator create abstraction u
Languages today sophisticated enough allow anybody easily
If code generator also intend snippet try difference typing ctor TAB writing constructor time class
Or check much time earn using snippet create switch statement related enum many value
If paid LOC work people understand code generation make lot sense
This joke way I worked one programmer employ technique exactly purpose
Nobody get paid LOC formally I know anyway programmer generally expected productive churning large volume code make someone productive
As slightly tangential point I think also explains tendency coder break single logical unit code many different class possible ever inherit project class
Here heresy If task stupid automated program writing time
source code generated script let say XML also done
representation XML interpreted using
So essence programmer lazy attempt solve real problem took easy way wrote code generator
In Java C look reflection look template By posting answer agree

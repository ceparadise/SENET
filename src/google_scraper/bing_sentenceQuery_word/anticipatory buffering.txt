In region physical memory storage used temporarily store moved one place another
Typically data stored buffer retrieved microphone sent output device speaker
However buffer may used moving data within computer
This comparable buffer telecommunication
Buffers implemented fixed memory location using virtual data buffer software pointing location physical memory
In case data stored data buffer stored
A majority buffer implemented typically use faster store temporary data due much faster access time compared
Buffers typically used difference rate data received rate processed case rate variable example printer
A buffer often adjusts timing implementing algorithm memory simultaneously writing data queue one rate reading another rate
Buffers often used conjunction sending receiving data playing sound speaker
A line amusement park share many similarity
People ride coaster come unknown often variable pace roller coaster able load people burst coaster arrives loaded
The act temporary space wishing ride wait ride available
Buffers usually used first first method outputting data order arrived
Buffers increase application performance allowing operation file read writes complete quickly instead blocking waiting hardware interrupt access physical disk subsystem instead operating system immediately return successful result API call allowing application continue processing kernel completes disk operation background
Further benefit achieved application reading writing small block data correspond block size disk subsystem allowing buffer used aggregate many smaller read write operation block size efficient disk subsystem case read sometimes completely avoid physically access disk
A buffer used telecommunication compensates difference rate flow event transferring data one device another
Buffers used many purpose including A often also act buffer vice versa
However cache operate premise data read multiple time written data soon read good chance multiple read writes combine form single larger block
Their sole purpose reduce access underlying slower storage
A cache also usually designed invisible
A Disk Cache File Cache keep statistic data contained within commits data within period mode
A buffer none
A buffer primarily used input output sometimes storage data either en route medium data may modified manner written read sequential manner
An early mention print buffer Outscriber devised image processing pioneer Russel Kirsch One important problem design automatic digital computer getting calculated result machine rapidly enough avoid delaying progress calculation
In many problem computer applied amount output data relatively big big serious inefficiency would result forcing computer wait data typed existing printing device
This difficulty solved SEAC providing magnetic recording device output unit
These device able receive information machine rate time fast electric typewriter operated
Thus better efficiency achieved recording output data transcription made later magnetic recording device printing device without tying main computer

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A buffer data area shared hardware device program process operate different speed different set priority
The buffer allows device process operate without held
In order buffer effective size buffer algorithm moving data buffer need considered buffer designer
Like buffer midpoint holding place exists much accelerate speed activity support coordination separate activity
This term used programming hardware

Printer spool handled modern operating system
Hemera Images Your computer process data store sends different peripheral output device
Computer science us term specific type process spooling buffering caching
These term specific meaning computer science similar function
Many people especially use interchangeably
The specific depend case
When type keyboard using input device
When letter type appear screen screen output device
In many operating system text appearing terminal window called standard output
Standard output buffered default
The reason nobody really want type everything see second experience typing program rightly convinced something wrong
Spooling name come acronym Simultaneous Peripheral Operation SPOOL
Spooling wait entire operation done sending output device network likeliest encounter spooling probably come sending document printer
If ever wondered delay press Print document coming printer spooling computer process entire print job format printer handle sends serial bus printer
Spooling also used sending receiving email
Spooling great sort computer task appropriate others
Watching video YouTube come expectation clicking Play cause video begin playing immediately
For work website sends small part video page load start sending next part video Play button clicked
These subsequent part queued buffer video play smoothly even though fully downloaded start
There third process used related spooling buffering caching
When computer cache file store local copy accessed speed local hard drive
Internet browser cache file get accessed lot time watch video hit Replay button browser usually pulling copy file downloaded previously rather downloading
At level bit byte CPU video card cache data boost performance

You probably seen term buffering buffer thrown around quite bit technology world harder find buffering definition easy understand
In short know whatever form buffering different kind generally speed trying computer
Buffering prevent lag streaming video prevent slow performance playing video game desktop computer
Buffering involves data certain area memory known buffer data accessed quickly one computer processing unit GPU form graphic CPU general computer processing need data
One common form buffering occurs broadband connection slow stream video real time
So computer buffer video data starting playback enough prevent video lag
If see happen often might time upgrade broadband speed maybe reset router download rate lower advertised Internet provider
Sometimes much data get loaded buffer causing technique used hacker take control computer infect virus
Recent advancement way programming language handle memory lessens chance buffer overflow happening older program still risk
While buffering general help enjoy better computing performance also mean connection quite snuff remember check performance regularly
Whatever reason computer video game system using buffer better buffering definition

Imagine eating candy bowl
You take one piece regularly
To prevent bowl running someone might refill bowl get empty want take another piece candy bowl
The bowl act buffer candy bag
If watching movie online web service continually download next minute buffer way computer download movie watching would cause hanging
The term buffer generic term specific IT CS
It place store something temporarily order mitigate difference input speed output speed
While producer faster consumer producer continue store output buffer
When consumer speed read buffer
The buffer middle bridge gap
If average definition I think get idea
For proof really walk mile thought snow every day go school see section Using Buffered bookmark
Do read subject nightmare
A buffer simply chunk memory used hold data
In general sense usually single blob memory loaded one operation emptied one Perchik candy bowl example
In C program example might minimal version
Here buffer array used store data read written buffer
There complicated buffer scheme used example finite number buffer used one next buffer full index wrap around first one
Buffer mean storage
Buffers important computing interconnected device system seldom sync one another information sent one system another somewhere wait recipient system ready
Really would depend context case one definition speaking generally buffer place temporarily hold something
The best real world analogy I think would waiting area
One simple example computing buffer refers part RAM used temporary storage data
Buffer temporary placeholder variable many programming language memory data dumped processing done

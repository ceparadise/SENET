Computers machine stuff information
They let view listen create edit information document image video sound spreadsheet database
They let play game simulated world really exist except information inside computer memory displayed screen
They let compute calculate numerical information let send receive information network
Fundamental computer represent information way inside computer memory well storing disk sending network
To make computer easier build keep reliable everything represented using two value
You may seen two value represented computer represented anything two state
For example memory low high voltage used store
On magnetic disk stored magnetism whether tiny spot disk magnetised north south
The idea stored transmitted digital world stored using two value might seem somewhat fantastic exercise give little experience using black white card represent number
In following interactive click last card right reveal one dot
Now click previous card two dot
Before clicking next one many dot predict
Carry clicking card moving left trying guess many dot
Use interactive online The challenge find way exactly dot showing answer spoiler
Now try making number dot
Is number ca represented
To test try counting
You may noticed card show twice many dot one right
This important pattern data representation computer
The number requires card white black white white black black white black white white white white white black white white black black black white
You found number represented card
Each number could communicated using two word black white
For example dot white black white white black
Or could decode black black white white white number
This basis data representation anything two different state represent anything digital device
When write stored computer paper normally use one state state
For example piece computer memory could following voltage We could allocate write sequence While notation used extensively may often hear data referred important remember computer store way
They using physical mechanism high low voltage north south polarity light dark material
The use two digit common best known computer jargon used
Since two digit system called binary
The short word binary digit made taking first two letter last letter digit two value
Every file save every picture make every download every digital recording every web page whole lot bit
These binary digit make digital technology
And nature digit unlock powerful world storing sharing wealth information entertainment
Computer scientist spend lot time reading bit knowing stored really important affect amount space data use amount time take send data friend data take space take longer send
quality stored
You may come across thing like colour encryption address ASCII
Understanding bit enables work much space required get colour secret code unique ID every device world text us character usual English alphabet
This chapter different method computer use code different kind information pattern bit affect cost quality computer even something feasible
To begin look Braille
Braille actually way computer represent data great introduction topic
When working material section good way draw braille paper without actually make raised dot draw rectangle small circle colour circle raised colour one raised
More year ago French boy invented system representing text using combination flat raised dot paper could read touch
The system became popular people visual impairment provided relatively fast reliable way read text without seeing
Louis Braille system early example binary representation data two symbol raised flat yet combination used represent reference book work literature
Each character braille represented cell dot
Each dot either raised raised
Different number letter made using different pattern raised raised dot
Let work many different pattern made using dot Braille character
If braille used dot would pattern
And dot would pattern You may noticed twice many pattern dot dot
It turn every time add extra dot give twice many pattern dot pattern dot pattern dot pattern
Can come explanation doubling number pattern occurs
The reason number pattern double extra dot say dot pattern dot use pattern dot flat raised
This give pattern
And one dot bring dot
This process repeated infinitely
So Braille dot make pattern
That enough letter alphabet symbol digit punctuation
The reason looking Braille chapter representation using bit
That contains different value raised raised contains sequence represent different pattern
The letter example could written mean raised dot mean raised dot assuming reading left right
This sometimes use show computer representing data
Braille also illustrates binary representation popular
It would possible three kind dot flat half raised raised
A skilled braille reader could distinguish three value per dot would need dot represent pattern
The trouble would need accurate device create dot people would need accurate sensing
If page squashed even slightly could leave information unreadable
Digital device almost always use two value binary similar reason computer disk memory made cheaper smaller need able distinguish two extreme value high low voltage rather distinction subtle difference voltage
Using ten digit like every day decimal counting system would obviously challenging
Why digital system hung using two digit
After could thing digit system
As happens people tried build computer hard
Recording digit involves accurate equipment reading voltage level magnetisation reflection lot easier check mainly one way
There discussion use binary Watch video online In section look computer represent number
To begin revise number system use every day work look binary
After look charactertistics number computer must deal negative number number decimal point
The number system human normally use base also known decimal
It worth revising quickly binary number use idea decimal number fewer digit
In decimal value digit number depends number
For example represents whereas represents
Each place value number worth time place value right
one ten hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousand million
Also different place value
If able use one digit represent number largest number would
After need second digit go left giving next ten number
It digit one worth time much one right
You may encountered different way expressing number using expanded form
For example want write number expanded form might written A sophisticated way writing If learnt exponent could write Remember number power
x
The key idea notice All probably sound really obvious worth thinking consciously binary number property
As discussed earlier computer store information using bit possible state
This mean represent base number using digit way write number decimal
Instead must represent number using digit
Binary work similar way Decimal even though might initially seem way
Because digit mean digit time value one immediately right
The base decimal system sometimes called denary consistent name binary base system
The word denary also refers Roman denarius coin worth ten ass copper bronze coin
The term denary seems used mainly UK US Australia NZ term decimal common
The interactive illustrates binary number system represents number
Have play around see pattern see
Use interactive online Find representation using interactive
What largest number make interactive
What smallest
Is integer value biggest smallest make
Are number one representation

You probably noticed interactive set leftmost bit significant bit add total next add rest add respectively
When set bit add anything total
So idea make number adding together number included
Choose number le perhaps house number age friend age day month born set binary digit zero start digit trying zero one
See find method converting number without much trial error
Try different number find quick way
Figure binary representation using interactive
What
Check answer using interactive verify correct
Can figure systematic approach counting binary

start number increment way highest number made bit
Try counting see detect pattern
Hint Think add number base
work etc
Can apply idea binary
Using new knowledge binary number system figure way count higher using finger
What highest number represent using finger
What included toe well finger toe count
A binary number incremented starting right flipping consecutive bit come first bit half time
Counting finger binary mean count finger finger
There number video YouTube people counting binary finger
One twist wear white glove number finger respectively make easy work value certain finger raised
The interactive used exactly bit
In practice use many bit need like decimal
For example bit place value would largest value binary decimal
Representing bit would give
Write representation following
If possible representation put Impossible
The answer space added make answer easier read required An important concept binary number range value represented using given number bit
When bit binary number start get useful represent value enough store someone age day month
Groups bit useful name
Computer memory disk space usually divided byte bigger value stored using one byte
For example two byte bit enough store number
Four byte bit store number
You check number working place value bit
Every bit added double range number
In practice computer store number either bit
This full number byte byte bit make easier computer know number start stop
Candles birthday cake use base numbering system place worth one right
For example number
This cause problem get older ever seen cake candle aware serious fire hazard
Luckily possible use binary notation birthday candle candle either lit lit
For example binary notation need candle two lit
There
It lot smarter use binary notation candle birthday get older need many candle
Most time binary number stored electronically need worry making sense
But sometimes useful able write share number unique identifier assigned digital device MAC address colour specified HTML page
Writing long binary number tedious example suppose need copy number
A widely used shortcut break number group case write digit group represents giving
There one small problem group bit go digit go
The solution simple introduce symbol digit letter A So example binary number written concisely
The B represents binary decimal number E represents binary decimal
Because digit representation base known hexadecimal hex short
Converting binary hexadecimal simple hexadecimal common way writing large binary number
Here full table number hexadecimal digit equivalent For example largest binary number
This written FF hexadecimal
Both representation mean conventional decimal system check converting binary number decimal
Which notation use depend situation binary number represent actually stored confusing read write hexadecimal number good shorthand binary decimal number used trying understand meaning number normal math
All three widely used computer science
It important remember though computer represent number using binary
They represent number directly decimal hexadecimal
A common place number stored computer spreadsheet database
These entered either spreadsheet program database program program somebody else wrote additional hardware sensor collecting data temperature air pressure ground shaking
Some thing might think number telephone number actually stored number contain important character like dash space well leading would lost stored number number would come quite right
These stored discussed next section
On hand thing look like number January often stored using value converted format meaningful reader try typing two date Excel subtract one result useful number
In underlying representation number used
Program code used translate underlying representation meaningful date user interface
The difference two date Excel number day date many system stored amount time elapsed since fixed date January
You test typing date like January chance wo formatted normal date
Likewise date sufficiently future may behave strangely due limited number bit available store date
Numbers used store thing diverse date student mark price statistic scientific reading size dimension graphic
The following issue need considered storing number computer In practice need allocate fixed number bit number know big number
This often bit bit although set bit even bit needed
This computer way knowing number start end otherwise
Any system store number need make compromise number bit allocated store number range value stored
In system like Java C programming language database possible specify accurately number stored others fixed advance spreadsheet
Some able work arbitrarily large number increasing space used store necessary
integer Python programming language
However likely still working multiple bit
bit bit bit bit etc
Once number big fit bit computer would reallocate bit
In programming language check number get big overflow
For example number using two complement largest number add one without checking change happens number
This cause serious problem checked behind variant problem called involving number overflowing date Tuesday January
On tiny computer embedded inside car washing machine tiny sensor barely larger grain sand might need specify precisely big number need
While computer prefer work chunk bit could write program example earthquake sensor know first bit lattitude next bit longitude next bit depth last bit amount force
Even standard computer important think carefully number bit need
For example field database could either perhaps representing four base occur DNA sequence used bit number every one add database grows
If item database wasted bit one bit needed represent number example total bit around MB
If lot database really add human DNA billion base pair incredibly wasteful use bit one
And application Google Maps storing astronomical amount data wasting space option
It really useful know roughly many bit need represent certain value
Have think following scenario choose best number bit option given
You want ensure largest possible number fit within number bit also want ensure wasting space
The binary number representation looked far allows u represent positive number
In practice want able represent negative number well balance account go negative amount temperature fall zero
In normal representation base number represent negative number putting minus sign front number
But binary simple
We look two possible approach Adding simple sign bit much like decimal useful system called Two Complement
On computer minus sign number work well use text based one representing number ca arithmetic character allocating one extra bit called bit represent minus sign
Just like decimal number put negative indicator left number sign bit set mean number positive sign bit set number negative minus sign front
For example wanted represent number using bit along additional bit sign bit give total bit would represent
The first bit meaning number positive remaining bit give meaning number
If wanted make would
The first bit meaning number negative remaining bit represent meaning number
Using bit described one sign actual number would binary representation
The space necessary added make reading binary number easier Going way easy
If binary number know negative first digit
The number part next bit
This mean number
What would decimal value following assuming first bit sign bit
But That convert
And
Since strange two different representation number
This one reason use simple sign bit practice
Instead computer usually use sophisticated representation negative binary number called
There alternative representation called avoids two representation importantly make easier arithmetic negative number
Representing positive number method already learnt
Using leftmost bit zero bit usual binary representation number example would would
This thing get interesting
In order convert negative number two complement representation use following process
For example assume want convert Two Complement representation
We would use process follows
Therefore Two Complement representation
The rule adding one binary number pretty simple let figure
First binary number end
would number change replace last
Now end much would increase change
What ending

The method adding simple easy build computer hardware quickly
What would two complement representation following number
Follow process given section remember need anything special positive number
In order reverse process need know whether number looking positive negative
For positive number simply convert binary number back decimal
But negative number first need convert back normal binary number
So know number positive negative
It turn reason understand later section Two Complement number negative always start positive number always start
Have look back previous example double check
So number start use following process convert number back negative decimal number
So needed convert back decimal would following
Convert following Two Complement number decimal
While might initially seem bit allocated sign bit bit behaves like one
With bit still make possible pattern
If attempted use bit represent positive number negative number would quickly realise number mapped onto pattern bit
Obviously make impossible know number actually represented
In practice number within following range represented
many number represent allow positive number sign needed many number represent require positive negative number
You work range value stored using unsigned number
decimal signed two complement range lowest number decimal highest number decimal
This might seem bit weird work really well normal binary addition used use representation even adding negative number
Before adding negative binary number look adding positive number
It basically addition method used decimal number except rule way simpler two different digit might add
You probably learnt column addition
For example following column addition would used
When go add result higher put one column carry column
Binary addition work exactly way
If wanted add two positive binary number would follow similar process column addition
You need know
The first three might expect
Adding cause carry digit since binary translates carry column addition
The last one add binary express carry
For two example number addition work like Remember digit
So need carry next column total get column decimal
With negative number using sign bit like work
If wanted add would expect get answer
Which
One way could solve problem use column subtraction instead
But would require giving computer hardware circuit could
Luckily unnecessary addition negative number work automatically using Two Complement
For addition start converting number Two Complement form
Because positive number need changed
But negative number sign bit removed use Two Complement need invert digit add giving
Adding two number work like Any extra bit left beyond using case bit truncated
This leaf like expecting
We also use subtraction
If subtracting positive number positive number would need convert number subtracting negative number
Then add two number
This decimal number example
This property Two Complement useful
It mean positive number negative number handled computer circuit addition subtraction treated operation
The idea using complementary number change subtraction addition seen decimal
The complement decimal digit digit add example complement complement
The word complement come root complete completes nice round number
Subtracting adding complement ignoring extra digit left
The complement add giving
For larger number subtracting two number complement number add next power

Check adding produce almost result subtracting
Working complement binary way easier two digit work working decimal may help understand going
We looked two different way representing negative number computer
In practice simple sign bit rarely used two different representation zero requiring different computer circuit handle negative positive number addition subtraction
Two Complement widely used one representation zero allows positive number negative number treated way addition subtraction treated one operation
There system One Complement Two Complement far widely used practice
There several different way computer use bit store text
In section look common one look pro con representation
We saw earlier unique pattern made using dot Braille
A dot corresponds bit dot bit different possible value
Count many different character letter letter number symbol could type text editor using keyboard
Don forget count symbol share number key symbol side punctuation
The collective name letter letter number symbol
D h character
Importantly space also character
If counted correctly find character might found around
Because bit represent character need bit turn need least bit represent character give possible pattern
This exactly representation text
In previous section explained happens number dot increased remember dot Braille effectively bit
Can explain knew bit enough represent character bit must enough represent character
Each pattern ASCII usually stored bit one wasted bit rather bit
However bit pattern meaning still possible pattern
Where possible prefer deal full byte bit computer ASCII extra wasted bit
Here table show pattern bit ASCII us character
For example letter c table pattern front extra padding make bit
The letter pattern
You could write word using code give someone else able decode exactly
Computers represent piece text sequence pattern much like Braille
For example word computer would
This c
Have look ASCII table check right
The name ASCII stand American Standard Code Information Interchange particular way assigning bit pattern character keyboard
The ASCII system even includes character ringing bell useful getting attention old telegraph system deleting previous character kind early undo end transmission let receiver know message finished
These day character rarely used code still exist missing pattern table
Nowadays ASCII supplanted code called happens ASCII extra bit open huge range character bit
Have go following ASCII exercise Be sure go checking answer
These answer
Note text treated character ASCII may confusing text different number
You may encountered distinction spreadsheet
cell start inverted comma Excel treated text rather number
One place come phone number type spreadsheet number come text displayed
In fact phone number really number leading zero important contain character example extn

ASCII first used commercially despite big change computer since still basis English text stored computer
ASCII assigned different pattern bit character along control character delete backspace
English text easily represented using ASCII language Chinese thousand different character
Unsurprisingly pattern nearly enough represent language
Because ASCII useful practice longer used widely
In next section look Unicode representation
These solve problem unable represent character
There several code popular ASCII including
A widely used variant Baudot code Murray code named New Zealand born inventor
One Murray significant improvement introduce idea control character carriage return new line
The control key still exists modern keyboard
In practice need able represent English character
To solve problem use standard called
Unicode around different character many different language current historic
Each character unique number assigned making easy identify
Unicode representation character set
In order represent Unicode character bit Unicode used
The Unicode encoding scheme tell u number corresponds Unicode character represented pattern bit
The following interactive allow explore Unicode character set
Enter number box left see Unicode character corresponds enter character right see Unicode number could paste one foreign language web page see happens character
Use interactive online The widely used Unicode encoding scheme called may seen name email header describing text file
Some Unicode encoding scheme
mean character represented using number bit
mean character represented fewer bit others
It better ensure commonly used character represented fewer bit uncommonly used character
Of course might commonly used character English necessarily commonly used character Japanese
You may wondering need many encoding scheme Unicode
It turn better English language text better Asian language text
The remainder text representation section look Unicode encoding scheme understand use better others certain situation
Unicode encoding scheme
The representation character simply number converted bit binary number
Leading zero used enough bit like represent digit decimal number
bit nice round number computer often referred word bit confusing since use character represent English word
For example character would The character would And character would The following interactive allow convert Unicode character representation
The Unicode character number also displayed
The bit simply binary number form character number
Use interactive online ASCII actually took approach
Each ASCII character number representation character number converted bit binary number
ASCII also fixed length encoding scheme every character ASCII represented using bit
In practice rarely used see pretty wasteful space
variable length encoding scheme widely used
We look next
What largest number represented bit
In decimal binary
The largest number Unicode character assigned actually largest possible bit number
What number decimal
Most number made using bit Unicode character attached lot wasted space
There good reason shorter number could represent character minimum number bit would need given currently around Unicode character
The largest number represented using bit around billion
You might seen number largest unsigned integer bit computer easily represent programming language The decimal number largest character
You represent current character bit
The largest number represent bit enough
If go bit give larger
Therefore need bit
encoding scheme Unicode
Characters lower Unicode number require fewer bit representation higher Unicode number
representation contain either bit
Remembering bit byte
For example character would The character would And character would The following interactive allow convert Unicode character representation
The Unicode character number also displayed
Use interactive online So actually work
Use following process interactive convert character
Lookup Unicode number character
Convert Unicode number binary number using bit necessary
Look back section binary number remember convert number binary
Count many bit binary number choose correct pattern use based many bit
Step explain use pattern
Replace x pattern bit binary number converted
If x bit replace extra x
For example wanted find representation cat Chinese step would take would follows
Therefore representation using
Just like encoding scheme Unicode
Because far complex wo explain work
However following interactive allow represent text
Try putting text English text Japanese
Compare representation get
Use interactive online We looked ASCII
The following table summarises said far representation
In order compare evaluate need decide mean representation good
Two useful criterion We know represent character ASCII represent English
Therefore ASCII fails first criterion
But second criterion simple
The following interactive allow find length piece text using
Find sample English text Asian text forum translation site good place look see long various sample encoded three representation

In school art class may mixed different colour paint dye together order make new colour
In painting common use red yellow blue three primary colour mixed produce lot colour
Mixing red blue give purple red yellow give orange
By mixing red yellow blue make many new colour
For printing printer commonly use three slightly different primary colour cyan magenta yellow CMY
All colour printed document made mixing primary colour
Both kind mixing called subtractive mixing start white canvas paper subtract colour
The interactive allows experiment CMY incase familiar like mixing colour
Use interactive online Computer screen related device also rely mixing three colour except need different set primary colour starting black screen adding colour
For additive colour computer colour red green blue RGB used
Each pixel screen typically made three tiny light one red one green one blue
By increasing decreasing amount light coming three different colour made
The following interactive allows play around RGB
Use interactive online See colour make interactive
Can make black white shade grey yellow orange purple
Having slider extreme produce black white value grey

Yellow might expect made red green blue
There good reason mix three primary colour specify colour pixel
The human eye million light sensor one detect colour called cone
There three different kind cone detect red blue green light respectively
Colours perceived amount red blue green light
Computer screen pixel take advantage releasing amount red blue green light perceived desired colour eye
So see purple really red blue cone eye stimulated brain convert perceived colour
Scientists still working exactly perceive colour representation used computer seem good enough give impression looking real image
For information RGB display see information eye sensing three colour see Wikipedia
Because colour simply made amount primary colour red green blue three number used specify much primary colour needed make overall colour

Photographs commonly several megapixels
It unusual computer screen million computer need represent colour one pixel
A commonly used scheme use number range
Those number tell computer fully turn primary colour light individual pixel
If red set mean red light completely
If red light set would mean light fully
With possible value three primary colour forget count
give x x possible colour human eye detect
Think back binary number section
What special number maximum colour value
We cover answer later section still sure
The following interactive allows zoom image see pixel used represent
Each pixel solid colour square computer need store colour pixel
If zoom far enough interactive show value pixel
You pick pixel put value slider come colour pixel
Use interactive online Another exercise see relationship bit pattern colour image
The next thing need look bit used represent colour high quality image
Firstly many bit need
Secondly decide value bit
This section work problem
With different possible value amount primary colour mean bit would needed represent number
The smallest number represented using bit
And largest number represented using bit
Because three primary colour need bit represent different possible value need represent colour
So many colour total bit
We know possible value colour take easiest way calculating This
Because bit required representation called
bit colour sometimes referred setting True Color accurate human eye see
On Apple system called Millions colour
A logical way use binary number represent amount red green blue pixel
In order convert amount primary colour needed bit binary number put binary number side side give bit
Because consistency important order computer make sense bit pattern normally adopt convention binary number red put first followed green finally blue
The reason put red first convention system assume used
If everybody agreed green first would green first
For example suppose colour red green blue would like represent bit
If put value interactive get colour
Start converting three number binary using bit
You get Putting value together give bit representation colour
There three number pattern bit rather actually three binary number computer concept space bit pattern anyway everything must
You could write space make easier read represent idea likely stored byte inside computer memory sequence high low voltage even writing arbitrary notation
Also leading trailing part kept without would representing shorter number
If different possible value primary colour final representation bit long
Black white image usually two colour typically shade grey represented bit
Remember shade grey made equal amount primary colour example red green blue
So monochromatic image simply use representation single binary number tell u value primary colour set
The computer ever convert number decimal work binary directly process take bit make right pixel appear typically done graphic card printer
We started decimal easier human understand
The main point knowing representation understand made accuracy colour ideally beyond human perception amount storage bit needed little possible
If already read section otherwise section might make sense
When writing HTML code often need specify colour text background
One way specify colour name example red blue purple gold
For purpose okay
However use name limit number colour represent shade might exactly one wanted
A better way specify bit colour directly
Because binary digit hard read colour HTML use quick way write bit example
The hash sign mean interpreted hexadecimal representation since hexadecimal digit corresponds bit digit represent bit colour information
This hex triplet format used HTML page specify colour thing like background page text colour link
It also used CSS SVG application
In bit colour example earlier bit pattern
This broken group bit
And group bit need represented digit
Which give
Understanding hexadecimal colour code derived also allows change slightly without refer back colour table colour exactly one want
Remember bit color code first bit specify amount red first digit hexadecimal code next bit specify amount green next digit hexadecimal code last bit specify amount blue last digit hexadecimal code
To increase amount one colour change appropriate hexadecimal letter
For example zero red green blue setting higher value middle two digit add green colour
You use HTML page experiment hexadecimal colour
Just enter colour space Use interactive online What use fewer bit represent colour
How much space saved compared impact image
The following interactive get try match specific colour using bit bit
It possible get perfect match using bit colour
But bit
Use interactive online The system used bit specify amount red possible value bit specify amount green possible value bit specify amount blue possible value
This give total bit hence name used make different bit pattern thus represent different colour
You may wondering blue represented fewer bit red green
This human eye least sensitive blue therefore least important colour representation
The representation us bit rather bit easiest computer work full byte
Using scheme represent pixel image take one third number bit required colour good showing smooth change colour subtle shade possible color pixel
This one big tradeoff data representation allocate le space fewer bit want higher quality
The number bit used represent colour pixel particular image sometimes referred colour depth bit depth
For example image display colour depth choice colour pixel
There
Drastically reducing bit depth image make look strange sometimes used special effect called posterisation ie
making look like poster printed colour
There subtle boundary low quality data representation colour compression method
In principle reducing image colour way compress poor approach proper compression method like JPEG much better job
The following interactive show happens image use smaller range colour including right zero bit
You choose image using menu upload one
In case change quality noticeable
In
In would actually care colour image
In situation colour actually necessary
fine two colour
Use interactive online Although provide simple interactive reducing number bit image could also use software like Gimp Photoshop save file different colour depth
You probably noticed colour look particularly bad face used seeing subtle skin tone
Even colour noticably worse face
In case image almost good image unless look really carefully
They also use space would colour
For image need downloaded device internet expensive worth thinking carefully
Have experiement following interactive see impact different number bit colour
Do think bit colour right bit blue green red got bit
Use interactive online One interesting thing think whether want bit colour
It turn human eye differentiate around million colour million provided bit colour already beyond eye distinguish
However image processed software enhances contrast may turn colour sufficient
Choosing representation simple
An image represented using bit colour would bit per pixel
In x pixel image reasonable size photo would contain pixel thus would use bit
This work around megabyte
If use colour instead use third memory would save nearly megabyte storage
Or image downloaded megabyte bandwidth saved
bit colour used much anymore although still helpful situation accessing computer desktop remotely slow internet connection image desktop instead sent using bit colour instead bit colour
Even though may cause desktop appear bit strange stop getting whatever needed get done done
Seeing desktop bit colour would helpful could get work done
In country mobile internet data expensive
Every megabyte saved cost saving
There also situation colour matter example diagram black white printed image
If space really issue crude method reducing range colour usually used instead compression method JPEG GIF PNG used
These make much clever compromise reduce space image take without making look bad including choosing better palette colour use rather using simple representation discussed
However compression method require lot processing image need decoded representation discussed chapter displayed
The idea present chapter commonly come designing system graphic interface working image RAW photograph typically goal choose best representation possible without wasting much space
Have look Compression Chapter find
Before reading section understanding low level language see section chapter
In similar fashion representing text number using binary represent entire actual program using binary
Since program sequence instruction need decide many bit used represent single instruction going interpret bit
Machine code instruction typically combination two piece operation operand
In machine code program li add considered operation load integer add two integer respectively
register operand represent place store value inside machine
literal operand allow instruction represent exact integer value
If using operating system might encode instruction instruction broken piece follows Our operation always determined bit first instruction
In example machine code mean li mean add
For li operation bit interpreted storage place allowing represent
Similarly bit add instruction represent
Can figure bit instruction represent
Using bit represent program instruction data form text number image allows entire computer program represented binary format
This allows program stored disk memory transferred internet easily data
The kind image representation covered basic one used digital system main point chapter understand digital representation work compromise needed number bit storage used quality
The colour representation discussed often referred raw bitmap bmp representation
For large image real system use compression method JPEG GIF PNG reduce space needed store image point image captured displayed inevitably represented using raw bit described chapter basic choice capturing displaying image affect quality cost device
Compression regarded form encoding covered later chapter
The representation number whole area study
The choice representation affect quickly arithmetic done number accurate result much memory disk space used storing data
Even integer issue like order large number broken across multiple byte
Floating point number generally follow common standard IEEE standard common one make easy design compatible hardware process
Spreadsheets usually store number using floating point format limit precision calculation typically bit used number
There many experiment done calculating adding large number small one demonstrate limitation floating point representation
This puzzle solved using pattern binary number complex activity binary number including fraction multiplication division

A unit measurement express amount business functionality product provides user
Function point used compute functional size measurement FSM software
The cost dollar hour single unit calculated past project
As several recognized standard public specification sizing software based Function Point
open membership computer industry standard consortium adopted Automated Function Point AFP specification led
It provides standard automating Function Point counting according guideline International Function Point User Group However current implementation standard limitation able distinguish External Output EO External Inquiries EQ box without upfront configuration
Function point defined Allan Albrecht
The software identified one categorized one five type output inquiry input internal file external interface
Once function identified categorized type assessed complexity assigned number function point
Each functional user requirement map business function data entry Input user query Inquiry
This distinction important tends make function measured function point map easily requirement also tends hide internal function
algorithm also require resource implement
There currently ISO recognized FSM Method includes algorithmic complexity sizing result
Recently different approach proposed deal perceived weakness implemented several commercial software product
The variation IFPUG method designed make weakness include The use function point favor line code seek address several additional issue Albrecht observed research Function Points highly correlated line code resulted questioning value measure objective measure namely counting line code available
In addition multiple attempt address perceived shortcoming measure augmenting counting regimen
Others offered solution circumvent challenge developing alternative method create proxy amount functionality delivered

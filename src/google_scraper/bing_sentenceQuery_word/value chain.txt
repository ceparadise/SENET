A way look two different type business activity first action creates value customer following action support execution first action
For instance grocery store may determine offering grocery delivery first action create value customer
The following action support grocery delivery may include online ordering delivery scheduling automatic weekly delivery
These multiple activity linked together create value customer
When important company evaluate action valuable customer providing greatest level satisfaction convenience
Once company determined customer truly want must analyze whether activity feasible provided customer
Once determined service action feasible company create value chain activity deliver service
The value chain analysis end
A proactive company review value chain activity see customer satisfied result
There may new step added altered value chain make process smoother offer greater value thus strengthening effect value chain

In language becomes necessary distinguish content location variable
In language value
This mean resulting value independent location expression needed compute value stored
Only content location bit whether interpretation significant
Some language use idea deriving typical mode evaluation left right hand side assignment statement
An lvalue refers object persists beyond single expression
An rvalue temporary value persist beyond expression us
The notion introduced CPL
The notion expression analogous mode input parameter value assigned parameter value assigned though technical detail differ context language
In many language notably programmatically accessible running program via operator like meaning variable dereferenced reference certain memory location
see term used distinguish
Consider C expression
When executed computer generates integer value program explicitly designated computer stored expression non
On hand C program declares variable x assigns value x expression value
In C term originally meant something could assigned hence name indicating left side assignment operator since reserved word constant added language term
In special exists denote compiler address retrieved using operator program see
This type reference applied including well
Some processor provide one instruction take sometimes referred immediate short
An immediate value stored part instruction employ usually load add subtract register
The part instruction destination
The latter may implicit
A value may reside register stored elsewhere memory requiring instruction contain direct indirect address index register address value
The expression designates refers object
A addressable assignable
A modifiable allows designated object changed well examined
An expression expression
One example immediate value look consequently A value virtually kind data given instance string digit single letter
Processors often support one size immediate data
bit employing unique opcode mnemonic instruction variant
If programmer supply data value fit assembler issue Out range error message
Most assembler allow immediate value expressed data
Thus ASCII character
The string may differ processor depending assembler computer architecture

Harvard Business School Michael Porter first introduce concept value chain
Porter also developed show business rank competition current marketplace discussed value chain concept book Competitive Advantage Creating Sustaining Superior Performance Free Press
Competitive advantage understood looking firm whole Porter wrote
It stem many discrete activity firm performs designing producing marketing delivering supporting product
Each activity contribute firm relative cost position create basis differentiation
In book Porter split business activity two category primary support
Primary activity include following The support activity help primary function comprise following According two different approach value chain analysis cost differentiation advantage
After identifying primary support activity business identify cost driver activity
For activity cost driver could include fast work completed work hour wage rate etc
Businesses identify link activity knowing cost reduced one area reduced another
Businesses identify opportunity reduce cost

In prodigy go Harvard creates technology company sophomore dorm
Six year later company worth billion touch one every people earth
Facebook familiar American success story founder Mark Zuckerberg following path blazed Bill Gates others like
But may also become increasingly rare
Far fewer student studying computer science college
This problem way one
The sign everywhere
This year first time decade College Board failed offer student Advanced Placement AB Computer Science exam
The number high school teaching computer science shrinking last year student sat AB test
Two decade ago I one
I never held job
Yet time pass I understand important education
Something lost student longer study working thing
My childhood interest programming product nature nurture
My father worked computer scientist first university researcher General Electric
As kid I tagged along lab weekend watching connect DEC computer ring network array feeling ozone hum machine
By adolescence moved suburb whose high school could afford mainframe
That plus social awkwardness meant many night plugged modem battling rudimentary combat accumulating treasure dungeon without end
Before long I wanted understand game came exactly worked
So I took programming first Basic Pascal
Coding taught shape logic value brevity attention detail debugging requires
I learned beautiful program single misplaced semicolon like sport car one piston line
Both dead machine functionally indistinguishable junk
I learned good enough build thing supposed
I left college intending major computer science
That lasted fifth Monday class point enthusiasm party beer got upper hand I switched humanity offered academic standard course schedule
I never touched Pascal
Fortunately student fortitude
They helped build sustain IT revolution continues make America center global innovation
But number people going way decline
According Computing Research Association annual number bachelor degree awarded computer science computer engineering dropped percent
When Zuckerberg started Facebook university awarded computer degree
The total fell last year
This geek shortage magazine put endangers everything innovation economic growth national defense
And I learned first job graduate school perhaps even
There Indiana office role calculate proposal setting local school rate distributing fund would play state school district
I teaching statistical program SAS
The syntax easy since underlying logic far Pascal
But way simulate state byzantine law understand every inch every historical curiosity political compromise last dollar cent
To write code thing know thing absolutely
Over time I became mildly obsessed care feeding SAS code
I wrote rewrote aim creating simplest elegant procedure possible one would job minimum space time
It someone bothering computer resource
It seemed like right thing
Eventually I reached limit clean code could
Yet I unsatisfied
Parts still seemed vestigial wrong
I realized problem modest programming skill law grown incrementally decade budget bringing new tweak procedure layered atop last
So I sat mostly intellectual exercise rewrite formula first principle
The result yielded satisfyingly direct SAS procedure
Almost afterthought I showed friend worked state legislature
To surprise reacted enthusiasm month later new financing formula became law
Good public policy good code turned go hand hand
The law reaccumulated extraneous procedure decade since
But basic idea still directing billion dollar schoolchildren using language recorded state law officially named Indiana Code
A year later I switched career began writing magazine publication like one
It difficult work
You say great deal small amount space
Struggling build whole world word I thought back story father would tell consulting Galileo project
To make work technology withstand rigor deep space fellow programmer fit every take picture fire rocket radio NASA back Earth machine byte call RAM
That buy cheap laptop Best Buy today
So every program Galileo polished gleam
Good editor know Moore law human cognition would double ability retain process information every month
Instead surfeit modern information made need clarity concision acute
My editor rarely said word word sense phrase idea
The real work structure constructing unbroken chain logic evidence emotion would bring reader precisely I wanted
I learned minimize number operating variable people
I also learned talented writer get away recursive usually best start beginning finish end
I discovered skilled writer like programmer embed subtle piece documentation prose remind reader going
Writing word coding different name
It like constructing program run universal human operating system narrative Joan Didion said tell story order live
Authors adhere set principle structured way computer language
Publications worth writing insist Galilean standard quality concision
Computer science exposed two generation young people rigor logic rhetoric disappeared far many curriculum humanity
Those student learned speak machine future humanity increasingly intertwined
They discovered virtue understanding instruction lie heart thing realizing danger misplaced semicolon learning labor built good enough supposed
I left computer science I year old
Thankfully never left

A set activity firm operating specific industry performs order deliver valuable
The concept come business management first described
The idea value chain based process view organization idea seeing manufacturing service organization system made subsystem input transformation process output
Inputs transformation process output involve acquisition consumption resource money labour material equipment building land administration management
How value chain activity carried determines cost affect profit
The concept value chain decision support tool added onto competitive strategy paradigm developed Porter early
In Porter value chain Inbound Logistics Operations Outbound Logistics Marketing Sales Service categorized primary activity
Secondary activity include Procurement Human Resource management Technological Development Infrastructure pp

According OECD emergence global value chain GVCs late provided catalyst accelerated change landscape international investment trade major consequence government well enterprise
The appropriate level constructing value chain level
Products pas chain activity order activity product gain value
The chain activity give product added value sum added value activity
The activity illustrate difference cost value chain
The cutting activity may low cost activity add much value end product since rough diamond significantly le valuable cut diamond
Typically described value chain documentation process assessment auditing adherence process routine core quality certification business

A firm value chain form part larger stream activity Porter call
A value system industry value chain includes supplier provide input necessary firm along value chain
After firm creates product product pas value chain distributor also value chain way customer
All part chain included value system
To achieve sustain competitive advantage support advantage information technology firm must understand every component value system
The value chain categorizes generic activity organization
The activity considered enhancement process broadly categorized two major
In practice progressive organisation afford remain stuck one value chain
In order cover market space organisation need deploy best practice space churn informative data used improve ongoing develop new
Hence organisation today try employ
Physical Value shown sample
This matrix suggests number opportunity improvement business process
An industry physical representation various process involved producing good service starting raw material ending delivered product also known
It based notion link read stage production level
The sum total yield total value
The French Physiocrats one earliest example value chain
Wasilly Leontief table published provide estimate relative importance individual link economy
Often multinational enterprise MNEs developed global value chain investing abroad establishing affiliate provided critical support remaining activity home
To enhance efficiency optimize profit multinational enterprise locate research development design assembly production part marketing branding activity different country around globe
MNEs activity example cost labor lowest
emergence global value chain GVCs late provided catalyst accelerated change landscape international investment trade major consequence government well enterprise
Through global value chain growth interconnectedness MNEs play increasingly larger role internationalisation business
In response government cut Corporate income tax CIT rate introduced new incentive research development compete changing geopolitical landscape
In industrial development context concept analysis first introduced Gereffi et al
gradually integrated development policy others
Value chain analysis also employed development sector mean identifying poverty reduction strategy upgrading along value chain
Although commonly associated trade development practitioner begun highlight importance developing national chain addition international one
For example investigated strengthening value chain crop
Its aim provide sustainable mean making ethanol would increase income rural poor without sacrificing food fodder security protecting environment
The value chain framework quickly made way forefront management thought powerful analysis tool
The simpler concept process developed next decade success early
The concept extended beyond individual firm
It apply whole network
The delivery mix end customer mobilize different economic factor managing value chain
The industry wide synchronized interaction local value chain create extended value chain sometimes global extent
Porter term larger interconnected system value chain value system
A value system includes value chain firm supplier supplier way back firm firm distribution channel firm buyer presumably extended buyer product
Capturing value generated along chain new approach taken many management strategist
For example manufacturer might require part supplier located nearby assembly plant minimize cost transportation
By exploiting upstream information flowing along value chain firm may try bypass intermediary creating new way create improvement value system
Value chain analysis also successfully used large petrochemical plant maintenance organization show work selection work planning work scheduling finally work execution considered element chain help drive lean approach maintenance
The Maintenance Value Chain approach particularly successful used tool helping change management seen business process tool
A value chain approach could also offer meaningful alternative evaluate private public company lack publicly known data direct competition subject company compared example known downstream industry good feel value building useful correlation downstream company
Once value analysed contributing part organisation identified model used conjunction Value Chain ass area either improved capitalised upon
For example SWOT analysis used within Outbound Logistics Function understand strength weakness opportunity may improve area identify threat may critical part value delivery system
Equally model used ass performance risk market potential environmental waste etc
The Council global trade consortium operation member company governmental academic consulting group participating last year manages SCOR universal reference model including Planning Procurement Manufacturing Order Management Logistics Returns Retail Product Service Design including Design Planning Research Prototyping Integration Launch Revision Sales including CRM Service Support Sales Contract Management congruent Porter framework
The framework adopted hundred company well national entity standard business excellence adopted newly launched DCOR framework product design standard use managing development process
In addition process element reference framework also maintain vast database standard process metric aligned Porter model well large constantly researched database prescriptive universal best practice process execution
Human Resource value chain help improve business performance applying full capability people

In contract contractor includes cost material labor plus contractor fee bid
The contractor receive separate cost reimbursement
A contract contract incentivizes contractor bring project budget
A contract reimburses cost pay contractor fee negotiated prior signing contract
A method contract present incentive contractor keep cost production low possible
It provides method applying cost saving due contractor effective purchasing completion time pay contractor receives work
The legal agreement specifies target cost base contractor pay formula used figure incentive bonus minimum maximum limit contractor pay
Regardless actual cost project contract negotiated fee remains fixed
If scope contract change fee may adjusted
The contractor submits separate invoice reimbursement cost material labor
This contract used project cost difficult estimate present risk contractor attempting turn winning bid
It award contract basis contractor fee primarily
However provides incentive contractor control cost
A agreement contract
The contractor estimate total cost material labor includes bid price contract generally awarded lowest bid
The total pay contractor receives cover cost
This provides contractor powerful incentive control cost time take complete project
A problem type contract happens contractor underestimate cost unexpected delay price material rise significantly
In case contractor may forced business abandon contract project finished

When contractor completes performance party negotiate final cost final price established applying formula
When final cost le target cost application formula result final profit greater target profit conversely final cost target cost application formula result final profit le target profit even net loss
If final negotiated cost exceeds price ceiling contractor absorbs difference loss
Because profit varies inversely cost contract type provides positive calculable profit incentive contractor control cost

The contract contract provides initially negotiated fee adjusted later formula based relationship total allowable cost total target cost
This contract type specifies target cost target fee minimum maximum fee fee adjustment formula
After contract performance fee payable contractor determined accordance formula
The formula provides within limit increase fee target fee total allowable cost le target cost decrease fee target fee total allowable cost exceed target cost
This increase decrease intended provide incentive contractor manage contract effectively
When total allowable cost greater le range cost within formula operates contractor paid total allowable cost plus minimum maximum fee
A contract appropriate service development test program A contract necessary see A target cost fee adjustment formula negotiated likely motivate contractor manage effectively
The contract may include technical performance incentive highly probable required development major system feasible Government established performance objective least general term
This approach may also apply acquisition use cost technical performance incentive desirable administratively practical

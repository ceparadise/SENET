In property instituted purpose preventing requirement one never enter time another thread execution enters critical section
The requirement mutual exclusion first identified solved seminal paper titled credited first topic study
A simple example mutual exclusion important practice visualized using four item second third removed
The removal node sits node performed changing pointer previous node point next node word node removed pointer node changed point node thereby removing linked list reference node
When linked list shared multiple thread execution two thread execution may attempt remove two different node simultaneously one thread execution changing pointer node point node another thread execution change pointer node point node
Although removal operation complete successfully desired state linked list achieved node remains list pointer node point node
This problem called avoided using requirement mutual exclusion ensure simultaneous update part list occur
The problem mutual exclusion address problem resource sharing software system control multiple process access shared resource process need exclusive control resource work
The solution make shared resource available process specific code segment called
It control access shared resource controlling mutual execution part program resource would used
A successful solution problem must least two property Deadlock freedom expanded implement one property Every process program partitioned four section resulting four state
Program execution cycle four state order If process wish enter critical section must first execute trying section wait acquires access critical section
After process executed critical section finished shared resource need execute exit section release process use
The process return section
There software hardware solution enforcing mutual exclusion
Some different solution discussed
On system simplest solution achieve mutual exclusion disable process critical section
This prevent running effectively preventing process
Although solution effective lead many problem
If critical section long drift every time critical section executed timer interrupt longer serviced tracking time impossible critical section
Also process halt critical section control never returned another process effectively halting entire system
A elegant method achieving mutual exclusion
effective uniprocessor system
The use shared memory instruction provide mutual exclusion
A process location shared memory since operation atomic one process set flag time
Any process unsuccessful setting flag either go task try later release processor another process try later continue loop checking flag successful acquiring
still possible method allows system continue process halt holding lock
Several atomic operation used provide mutual exclusion data structure notable CAS
CAS used achieve mutual exclusion shared data structure creating linked list node represents desired operation performed
CAS used change pointer linked list insertion new node
Only one process successful CAS process attempting add node time try
Each process keep local copy data structure upon traversing linked list perform operation list local copy
Beside solution software solution exist use achieve mutual exclusion
Examples include following These algorithm work used platform executes
Programmers specify strict ordering memory operation within thread
It often preferable use synchronization facility provided operating system multithreading library take advantage hardware solution possible use software solution hardware solution exist
For example operating system library used thread try acquire already acquired lock operating system could suspend thread using swap another thread ready run could put processor low power state thread run
Therefore modern mutual exclusion method attempt reduce using queuing context switch
However time spent suspending thread restoring proven always time must waited thread become ready run blocked particular situation acceptable solution situation
One binary test set register sufficient provide solution mutual exclusion problem
But solution built test set register possibly lead starvation process become caught trying section
In fact distinct memory state required avoid lockout
To avoid unbounded waiting distinct memory state required
Most algorithm mutual exclusion designed assumption failure occurs process running inside critical section
However reality failure may commonplace
For example sudden loss power faulty interconnect might cause process critical section experience unrecoverable error otherwise unable continue
If failure occurs conventional mutual exclusion algorithm may deadlock otherwise fail key liveness property
To deal problem several solution using mechanism proposed
The solution explained used build synchronization primitive Many form mutual exclusion
For example classic permit one process get semaphore another process get second semaphore wait till semaphore released
Other common include process never get sufficient resource run completion higher priority thread wait thread high latency response interrupt prompt
Much research aimed eliminating effect often goal guaranteeing
No perfect scheme known
Blocking system call used sleep entire process
Until call became proper mechanism sleeping single thread within process see

In concurrent access shared resource lead unexpected erroneous behavior part program shared resource accessed protected
This protected section It executed one process
Typically critical section access shared resource peripheral device network connection would operate correctly context multiple concurrent access
Different code process may consist variable resource need read written whose result depend order action occur
For example variable x read process A process B write variable x time process A might get either old new value x
In case like critical section important
In case A need read updated value x executing Process A Process B time may give required result
To prevent variable x protected critical section
First B get access section
Once B finish writing value A get access critical section variable x read
By carefully controlling variable modified inside outside critical section concurrent access shared variable prevented
A critical section typically used program must update multiple related variable without separate thread making conflicting change data
In related situation critical section may used ensure shared resource example printer accessed one process time
The implementation critical section vary among different operating system
A critical section usually terminate finite time thread task process wait fixed time enter
To ensure exclusive use critical section synchronization mechanism required entry exit program
Critical section piece program requires access
As shown Fig case mutual exclusion Mutex one thread block critical section using locking technique need access shared resource thread wait get turn enter section
This prevents conflict two thread share memory space want access common resource
The simplest method prevent change processor control inside critical section implementing semaphore
In uni processor system done disabling interrupt entry critical section avoiding system call cause inside section restoring interrupt previous state exit
Any thread execution entering critical section anywhere system implementation prevent thread including interrupt granted processing time therefore entering critical section indeed code original thread leaf critical section
This approach improved upon using semaphore
To enter critical section thread must obtain semaphore release leaving section
Other thread prevented entering critical section time original thread free gain control CPU execute code including critical section protected different semaphore
Semaphore locking also time limit prevent deadlock condition lock acquired single process infinite time stalling process need use shared resource protected critical session
Typically critical section prevent thread processor process thread interrupt process thread
Critical section often allow nesting
Nesting allows multiple critical section entered exited little cost
If interrupt current process thread critical section scheduler either allow currently executing process thread run completion critical section schedule process thread another complete quantum
The scheduler migrate process thread another processor schedule another process thread run current process thread critical section
Similarly occurs critical section interrupt information recorded future processing execution returned process thread critical section
Once critical section exited case scheduled quantum completed pending interrupt executed
The concept scheduling quantum applies similar
Since critical section may processor entered synchronization required within executing processor
This allows critical section entered exited almost zero cost
No synchronization required
Only instruction stream synchronization needed
Most processor provide required amount synchronization simple act interrupting current execution state
This allows critical section case nothing per processor count critical section entered
Performance enhancement include executing pending interrupt exit critical section allowing scheduler run exit critical section
Furthermore pending interrupt may transferred processor execution
Critical section used locking primitive
Critical section kept short enough entered executed exited without interrupt occurring scheduler
critical section base issue
In parallel programming code divided thread
The variable split thread thread copy
Data structure like etc
data variable linked split thread hence implementing parallelism difficult
To improve efficiency implementing data structure multiple operation like insertion deletion search need executed parallel
While performing operation may scenario element searched one thread deleted another
In case output may erroneous
The thread searching element may hit whereas thread may delete time
These scenario cause issue program running providing false data
To prevent one method entire kept critical section one operation handled time
Another method locking node use critical section operation use node
Using critical section thus ensures code provides expected output
Critical section also needed When data arrives may arrive ordered format
Let say program X running machine need collect data socket rearrange check anything missing
While program work data program access socket particular data
Hence data socket protected critical section program X use exclusively

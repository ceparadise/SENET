Software around since
Which mean people faking way meeting software code build generation
Now software life pocket run car home dominates waking life ignorance longer acceptable
The world belongs people code
Those understand left behind
This issue comprises single story devoted code culture people make
There technical language along pretty basic mathematical concept
There also lot solid joke lasting insight
It may take hour read small price pay adding decade career
You educated successful person capable abstract thought
A VP SVP job
Your office appointed decent furniture healthy amount natural light filtered vertical blind commensurate nearly two decade service craft management
Copper plaque wall attest various leadership ability inside outside organization One Partner Innovation Banquet Award sale team support effort reduce cycle sale increased percent another Civic Guidelight overseeing volunteer team repainted troubled public school top bottom
You reputation throughout organization careful person bordering
The way put loath pay thing explained
You expect staff speak plain language
This policy served well many facet operation worked come overseeing software development
For entire working memory come along every two year suddenly hundred thousand dollar inevitably million must poured amorphous project variable deadline
Content management project customer relationship management integration project mobile apps paperless office thing global enterprise resource planning matter tightly clutch purse string software find way pry open finger
Here go
On side desk sits computer lap
He wearing taupe blazer
He come discus spending large sum create intangible abstraction website He need money support team new hire external resource
It preordained give thing CEO signed yet go responsible
Coders insanely expensive project start uncomfortably large budget ugly tendency grow
You need understand hour go
He say We basically limit Who wear taupe blazer
The CTO fired six month ago
That CTO three kid college mustache
It bad exit
The man taupe blazer TMitTB work new CTO
She come Adobe short hair mustache
Here told All computer code keep website running must replaced
At one time valuable keeping company running new CTO think garbage
She tell old code spaghetti system straining result
That service use pay monthly old busted
Your competitor animated shopping cart drive across top screen checkout
That cart remembers everything customer ever purchased generates invoice demand
Your cart memory
Salespeople stomp around office sighing like theater student telling embarrassed site
Nothing work right mobile
Orders cutting halfway
People logged warning
Something must done
Which TMitTB
Who anyway
Webmaster
IT
No Scrum My people split platform continues
Some want use Drupal make work still He frown
The option back end Backbone You furrowed brow eye sympathetically explains With option JavaScript front Those term heard
You read first part Wikipedia page book software project estimation
It made sense time
You ask universal framing question Did cost option He give number date
You know soul number half project go year schedule
He promise efficiency The Oracle license longer needed engineering moving free database
We probably done back Magento migration say
Meaning course predecessor probably done
You consult spreadsheet remind Oracle contract renewed month ago
So actually least keep eating cost
Sigh
This man make third le education ended
large perfectly fine state university
But connection LinkedIn
That plus sign bother
How many people know
Five
Five thousand
In mysterious way outranks
Not within company restaurant reservation around lawyer
Still He stroke short beard hand tanned hike sock embroidered little ninja
Don forget say got budget This real
A Scrum Master ninja sock come office said We got budget Should go career fine
You keep work perspective thinking barrel cash
You heard dry barrel hold worth single
Next year burn little barrel cash Oracle
One barrel bad
But never one barrel
Is project

Too soon tell
But definitely smell money burning
At stage meeting like look supplicant eye say
But done
Really truly finished
Come confession unburden soul
This time stop
You want inquiry met patronizing sigh impatience another explanation ship date Agile cycle continuous delivery
Better hide ignorance
You learning accept answer software project
We editor magazine asked Can tell code No I said
First I good math
I programmer yes I East Coast programmer one serious platform people Bay I began program nearly year ago learning via special version Perl language modified work Oracle database
A month work I damaged account fantasy basketball player
They sent angry
After I decided get better
Which say I natural
I love computer never made sense
And yet two decade jamming information brain I amassed enough knowledge computer revealed
Its magic stripped away
I talk someone used work Microsoft work without feeling burning shame
I happily talk people Google Apple rarely reenter general population
The World Wide Web I know best I coded money programming language Java JavaScript Python Perl PHP Clojure XSLT Web one small part larger world software development
There million professional software developer earth according research firm IDC
An additional million hobbyist
That roughly population greater Los Angeles metro area
Imagine programming
East Hollywood would Mac programmer West mobile Beverly Hills finance programmer Orange County Windows
There lot neighborhood There people write code embedded computer smaller thumb
There people write code run TV
There programmer everything
They different culture different tribal folklore use organize working life
If told system administrator taking juggling class would make sense I expect product manager take trapeze class
I met information architect list rank friendship spreadsheet
Security research specialist love party
What I saying I one million
So I writing view software development individual among million
Code life life
It time understand work
Every month becomes easier thing never done create new kind chaos find new kind order
Even though math skill never catch I love work
Every month code change world A computer clock benefit
They work math one step time Tick take number put box one
Tick take another number put box two
Tick operation might addition subtraction two number put resulting number box one
Tick check result zero go box follow new set instruction
You using pen paper anything computer thing billion time per second
And billion tiny operation add
They cause phone boop elevate elevator redirect missile

Consider happens strike key keyboard
Say lowercase The keyboard waiting press key release one constantly scanning see key pressed
Hitting key sends scancode
Just keyboard waiting key pressed computer waiting signal keyboard
When one come pike computer interprets pass farther interior
Here keyboard It simple right
The computer go table figure signal corresponds letter put screen
Of course easy
Computers machine
They know screen
To put screen computer pull image memory part font made line circle
It take line circle render little box pixel part memory manages screen
So far least three representation one letter signal keyboard version memory version sketched screen
We even considered store happens letter left right insert middle sentence
Or line circle mean reduced binary data
There surprisingly many way represent simple It amazing work
Coders people willing work backward key press
It take certain temperament page standard document manual documentation read thing like data field transmitted least significant bit first interest understanding expected ü keep getting Hardware tricky business
For decade work integrating building shipping computer way build fortune
But margin tightened
Look Dell back private hand Gateway acquired Acer
Dell Gateway two company stayed software typically building PCs came preinstalled Microsoft various service increase profit
This led much cursing individual spent computer figure stop antivirus software nagging pay
Years ago Microsoft king Steve Ballmer sweating blue jumped front stadium full people chanted Developers
Developers

Developers He yelled hoarse I love company Of course
If sell software light screen selling infinitely reproducible nothing
The margin nothing people start selling even cheaper nothing giving away
Which happened free system Linux began nibble devour server market application Google Apps began serve viable replacement desktop software
Expectations around software changed time
IBM unbundled software hardware got charge Microsoft rebundled Internet Explorer Windows got sued Apple initially refused anyone else ability write software iPhone came opened App Store expanded vast commercial soon world Angry Birds
Today much hardware come PC come operating system example OS includes hundred subprogram mail apps solitaire
Then download buy
There countless attempt make software easier write promising could code plain English manipulate set icon make list development simple bright senior executive average child could
Decades effort gone helping civilian write code might use calculator write
Nothing yet done away Thus craft professional class life craft emerged

Coders starting concept signal keyboard number memory created infinitely reproducible unit digital execution call software hoping meet need marketplace
Man
The system built used manage global economic infrastructure
If coder run world run thing run world
Most programmer working building widely recognized application like Microsoft Word
Software everywhere

Software switch channel cable box show else
You get money
An elevator take five
Facebook release software every day something like billion people software run inside Web browser mobile application
Facebook look like picture mom crocus son school software
We know computer clock benefit software start code
We know someone somehow enters program computer program made code
In old day meant putting hole punch card
Then put card box give operator would load computer would flip card identify hole update part memory little far back
Let talk modern code
It might look like That language called simply K famous brevity
That code test something palindrome
If next typed K confirm yes palindrome
So else might code look
Maybe like Excel formula hidden away number produce check box check But Excel spreadsheet tricky hide kind thing number
This opacity cause risk
One study researcher University Hawaii found percent spreadsheet
Programming also look like Scratch language kid That definitely programming right computer waiting click input wait type something repetitive involves hilarious animal
Or maybe That Fortran
The reason working forgot put quotation mark end first line
Try little harder thanks
All thing coding one kind another last bit programmer would readily identify code
A sequence symbol using typical keyboard character saved file kind someone typed copied pasted elsewhere
That mean kind coding valid help achieve goal
Coding broad human activity like sport writing
When software developer think coding thinking line code file
They handed problem think problem write code solve problem expect computer turn word deed
Code inert
How make ert
You run software transforms machine language
The word language little ambitious given make computing device wood marble
Your goal turn code explicit list instruction carried interconnected logic gate thus turning code something
A compiler software take symbol typed file transforms instruction
Imagine programming language called Business Operating Language United System Bolus
It terrible language suffice awkward paragraph
It one real command
We want print screen
To end write line code text file say And save
Now run imaginary compiler program
How start
The way lexical analysis going character character starting p grouping character token saving tree box
Let computer
The reason I showing see every character matter
Computers usually understand thing going character character bit bit transforming code kind code go
The Bolus compiler organizes token little tree
Kind like sentence diagram
Except instead noun verb adjective computer looking function argument
Our program inside computer becomes Trees really pleasant way thinking world
Your memo work section paragraph
Tree
Your program contains message contain subject line address
Tree
Your favorite software program menu bar individual item subitems
Tree
Every day Arbor Day Codeville
Of course trick
If cut open computer find countless little box row place put retrieve byte
Everything ultimately get thing little box pointing
That thing work
So tree actually like Every character truly truly matter
Every single stupid misplaced semicolon space meant tab bracket instead leave computer state panic
The tree know put leaf
Their root decay
The box stack neatly
For computer dumb billion marble also positively Stradivarian delicacy
That process going character character wrapped called function method subroutine component
Little computing single reliable name mean everyone always arguing semantics
And routine run often need
Second print anything wish one phrase
Third repeat process forever nothing stop machine break barring heat death universe
Obviously one besides Jack Nicholson really need keep typing phrase even turned bad idea
Instead worrying word stored memory go character character programming language let think thing like string array tree
That programming give
You may look programmer shoulder think code look complex boring covering repetitive boredom unimaginably vast
This thing individual character compiling program fake assembly language nonexistent computer print character one time
The principle applies every pixel screen every frequency encoded file every imaginary cube Minecraft
Computing treat human language arbitrary set symbol sequence
It treat music imagery film way
It good healthy exercise ponder computer right
Maybe reading laptop What step layer Lilliputian mechanism within
When icon open program word processor computer must know program disk
It sort accounting process
And load program mean load enormous list memory start step
What list look like
Maybe reading print
No shame
In fact thank
The paper artifact digital process
Remember put screen
See get sleepy writer typing letter keyboard Brooklyn paper thumb
What framed fearful symmetry
Thinking way teach two thing computer One magic matter much look like
There work make thing look like magic
And two crazy
Algorithm word writer invoke sound smart technology
Journalists tend talk Facebook algorithm Google algorithm usually inaccurate
They mean Algorithms require computer geometry
An algorithm solves problem great algorithm get name
Dijkstra algorithm famed computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra find shortest path graph
By way graph mean rather
Think map street connect street intersection
It graph
There graph around
Plumbing electricity code compilation social network Internet represented graph
Now monetize Many algorithm page Wikipedia
You spend day poking around wonder
example specimen show whenever anyone want wax algorithm buck trend
It simple way determining greatest common divisor two number
Take two number like
Divide first second
If remainder case divide smaller number remainder give remainder greatest common divisor
Now translate machine code get
There site called Rosetta Code show different algorithm different language
The great
Some example suspiciously long laborious tiny nonsense poetry like one language Forth Read loud preferably friend
Forth based concept stack special data structure
You make word thing stack building little language
PostScript language laser printer came Forth much like
Look similar code give take squiggle And Euclid algorithm PostScript
I admit might fun
Here Python credit Rosetta Code A programming language system encoding naming organizing algorithm reuse application
It algorithm management system
This despite hype silly say Facebook algorithm
An algorithm translated function function called run software executed
There algorithm relate image processing storing data efficiently rapidly running element list
Most algorithm come free already built programming language available organized library download Internet moment
You ton programming without actually thinking save something database print Web page cutting pasting code
But want computer say identify whether reading Spanish Italian need write function
So sense algorithm pure mathematical entity well practical expression idea place grubby hand
Dijkstra distributed remarkable challenging set least memo global computer science community starting continuing death known EWDs many
One thing took forever understand computer actually good They programmed execute certain operation certain degree precision much look like math human
Dijkstra said Computer science computer astronomy A huge part computer science understanding efficiency long take run
Computers fast get bogged example trying find shortest path two point large map
Companies Google Facebook Twitter built top fundamental computer science pay great attention efficiency user thing search status update tweet extraordinary number time
Thus absolutely worth time find excellent computer scientist many doctorate know efficiency buried
It take good mathematician computer scientist middling one effective programmer
Until start dealing million people network need blur sharpen million photo quickly use work people
When get real break comp sci
When anything hundred trillion time nanosecond delay add
Systems slow user get cranky money burn barrel
The hardest work programming getting around thing computable finding way break impossible task small possible component creating impression computer something actually like human conversation
This used known artificial intelligence research likely go name machine learning data When speak Siri Cortana respond service understand convert word text break text symbol match symbol symbol database term produce answer
Tons algorithm bundled applied mean computer fake listening
A programming language least two job
It need wrap lot algorithm reused
Then need go looking algorithm genius programmer every time need square root
And make easy programmer wrap new algorithm routine function reuse
The DRY principle Don Repeat Yourself one colloquial tenet programming
That name thing thing create function let computer repeat
This always work
Programmers repeat constantly
I written certain kind code hundred time
This DRY principle
Enough talk
Let code
After month budget freed Web project way
They give name Project Excelsior
Fine
TMitTB fair clothes often dress like Weezer check every week
He brings document
Every document name
The functional specification set least thousand statement user clicking button
Upon accessing Web page user logged identified name welcomed logged encouraged log create account
See user registration workflow

From list various error message
It sort blueprint word occasional program exist
Some part functional specification refer user story tiny hypothetical narrative people using site As visitor website I want search product I quickly purchase I Then something TMitTB call wireframe picture website look created program make everything seem sketched hand little though produced computer
This one get wrong idea take seriously
Patronizing point taken
You rarely see TMitTB person often conference present panel
He tweet panel note LinkedIn page
Often take picture audience stage see assembly mostly men many beard majority seem peering laptop instead stage
Nonetheless tweet accompanies photo say something like AMAZING audience
panel microservice architecture He often tell important purpose recruiting
Who say wrong
It cost much hire senior programmer hire midlevel executive maybe going conference job two month hired four people
His two recent hire Boston Hungary neither place office
But matter
Every day standup meeting via something called Slack essentially like Google Chat sort plaid visual theme programmer seem agree wonderful fruitful way work
I watch commits TMitTB say
Meaning every day review code team writes make sure
No one pushing production without test passing
We Your meeting comparison go hour people arranged around
You wonder get programmer stand already use standing desk
Perhaps ticket
Honestly would like go conference sometimes panel
You could drink bottled water hold forth fine
Conferences
The website Lanyrd list hundred technology conference June
There event software tester Chicago Twitter conference São Paulo one enterprise content management Amsterdam
In New York alone Big Apple Scrum Day Razorfish Tech Summit entrepreneurship boot camp veteran conference dedicated digital mapping many conference digital marketer one dedicated one Ruby one Scala programming language couple breakfast conference cascading style sheet one text analytics something called Employee Engagement Awards
Tech conference look like expect
Tons people Sheraton keynote Ballroom Or enormous stream people wandering South Southwest Austin
People come together dozen thousand attend panel ostensibly learn attend presentation brush skill secondary conference function one acculturation
You go technology conference affirm tribal identity transfer throng dilettante zone professional
You pick swag talk vendor thing
TechCrunch Disrupt NYC May Google developer conference San Francisco May Global Mobile Internet Conference Beijing April Nvidia GPU San Jose September South Southwest SXSW Interactive Festival Austin March Apple Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC San Francisco June TechCrunch Disrupt NYC May Re publica conference Berlin May TechCrunch Disrupt NYC May SXSW Interactive Festival Austin March WWDC San Francisco June Bloomberg Technology Conference San Francisco June Technology conference primate dynamic fully displayed relationship power hierarchy established
There keynote people created technology hand crafted given language
There regular speaker often paid airfare present idea technique approach
Then panel group people lined row forced semblance interaction audience check
I little panel
They tend drift
I sure exist
Here thing technology conference There much sexual harassment much sexist content conference
Which stupid computer dumb rock lacking genitalia
Women software enough started write post blog
Other woman
The problem pervasive There lot conference many report harassing behavior
The language Ruby preferred language startup bros developed worst reputation
At Ruby conference someone gave talk subtitled Perform Like Star sexy slide
That dispiriting
There criminal incident
Conferences began develop code conduct rule algorithm people men really follow
If subject witness unacceptable behavior concern please notify community organizer soon possible php architect dedicated providing event experience everyone tolerate harassment offensive behavior form
The Atlanta Java Users Group AJUG dedicated providing outstanding conference experience attendee speaker sponsor volunteer organizer involved DevNexus GeekyNerds regardless gender sexual orientation disability physical appearance body size race religion financial status hair color hair amount platform preference text editor choice
When people started talking conference behavior also began talk larger problem programming culture
This always issue conference issue gave people point common reference
Why many men field
Why behave strangely
Why hard group female programmer behave typical adult way
I go work I stick like sore thumb
I mistaken administrative assistant
I asked I physical security despite security wearing distinctive uniform wrote Erica Joy Baker worked among place Google
Always woman meeting often first female R D engineer first female project lead first female software team company I worked wrote another woman magazine
Fewer fifth undergraduate degree computer science awarded went woman according National Center Women Information Technology
Less percent people computing woman
And number woman computing fallen since even market skill expanded
The pipeline huge problem
And yet unsolvable
I met manager built perfectly functional large team half female coder
Places handicraft site Etsy made particular effort develop educational program mentorship program
Organizations Girl Develop It teach woman woman create software
It happening late boom though
In company began release diversity report programming team
It popular practice revealing
Intel percent female Yahoo

Apple Facebook Google Twitter Microsoft around percent
These number whole company programmer
That lot woman get stock option
The number people white Asian worse yet
Apple gave million fund diversity initiative equivalent percent market cap
Intel million diversity project
The average programmer moderately diligent capable basic mathematics working knowledge one programming language communicate management peer
Given significant number woman work journalist editor perform surgery run company manage small business use spreadsheet even serve Supreme Court longer surprised find woman working accountant professor statistician project manager hard imagine write JavaScript
Programming despite hype fantasy programmer world intellectually demanding task imaginable
Which lead one inescapable conclusion The problem woman technology woman
Many conference organized around specific programming language specific community PyCon Python programmer Strata conference big data Oscon coder ritual event people community
Attendees gather talk post video YouTube
Language matter
Programmers track success computer language way people track sport ranking commenting Web forum Reddit many language get subreddit currently reader run venture capital firm Y Combinator company named special kind function operates function named series paper written mostly influential programming language name nerdier subject matter
There hundred programming blog
Many large corporation let engineer blog generous gift given many recruiter hovering
Discussions programming go everywhere public time hundred language
There keen sense coming fading
It simply fashion one career programmer depends demonstrating capacity one language
So ranking frequently updated rarely shocking
As April world computer language according Tiobe index us variety indicator generate single ranking world programming Java C C followed JavaScript PHP Python
The ranking necessarily inexact another list consulting firm called RedMonk give JavaScript top spot followed Java
There many possible conclusion obvious one thing equal good Java programmer performs well interview career option similar candidate using obscure language
If code time language break top heard read blog post heard people lament terrible wonderful misguided possibly watched video tutorial played little
Taking new language spin good thing programmer
Often download file write couple line code decide want go
Most language free download use
Why people construct give away free language
Well creation good computer language work apex programmer
To produced successful language acknowledged monumental effort akin publishing multivolume history war fighting one
The reward glory
Changing language like fighting war language time trapped liminal state old busted self new promised version
Perl released language uniquely suited World Wide Web grew Web grew Perl supposed better every way redesign began grand pronouncement
But year people working continually often free project consider public interest still official Perl
Latest ETA Christmas
The Python language community keenly aware Perl community problem decided make necessary difficult change language part transition Version Version
They would modernize clean rough avoid grand reinventions
Development Python started first working version came transition ongoing
Making new language hard
Making popular language much harder still requires smile fortune
And changing way popular language work appears one difficult thing human requiring year coordination make standard align

A language software making software
The standard library set premade software reuse reapply
Take Python battery included meaning come ton preexisting code organized module reuse
Its standard library function let copy Web page replace word document
What mean process text
Well might string text The Quick Brown Fox save variable called
So call standard method string
You say make word lowercase producing quick brown Truly understanding language standard library one way one becomes proficient language
Typically visit Web page read book
But standard library beginning
For many Python enormous library prewritten module available nearly instantaneous download using package manager software
A module library package code intended extend language capability
Let say work advertising agency need process picture scale sharpen
You type one command Pillow module downloaded compiled automatically placed correct directory later reuse
You know course modern language module image processing also need know Pillow commonly used toolkit
Knowing find part job coding
You might learn Googling
You might ask friend
You might get information book website like The Hitchhiker Guide Python
A coder need able quickly examine identify giant complex library one recently actively updated best match current need
A coder need good listener
But payoff
Now Pillow installed typing fingertip dozen routine function related image processing use code change color rotate number degree scale convert GIF image JPEGs forth
Or need complex numerical analysis statistic work download NumPy suddenly enormous range mathematical algorithm available hundred year science research boiled
Audio processing interacting peculiar hardware speaking package thing
But need know find called
Code obscure command file
It requires map head know good library best documentation helpful message board located
If know thing spend time searching instead building cool new thing
If computer language thing make computer want matter one choose
For reason take bicycle pick fridge get physical oncological neurosurgeon
Some tool better certain job
It possible C programmer Java programmer read code harder make C code Java code work together
C Java represent world different way structure data different way address component computer different way
There true benefit everyone team using language
They thinking way instruct computer process data
It necessary every team across big organization use language
In fact often counterproductive
Large organization lot need use many language service meet
For example Etsy built atop service us Java library solution search available Java great
Some programming language C best exactly ask even mean crashing computer
Others like OCaml Haskell constrained ask programmer hew narrow form trying steer away anything stupid
Some language cute logo like Go gopher
There Scratch teaching language kid
It use text much allows li l coder move icon around screen assemble program like Legos
Its logo smiling cat two leg
And Lisp come logo first proposed alien holding flag proboscis
Lisp classic language
There language authority computer language
And one Most popular language look lot like
C de facto logo well letter C called C came another language
That language called B
C big deal get computing
Created Dennis Ritchie starting late Bell Labs principal development language UNIX operating system
Unix lowercased refer idea Unix instead branded version simple operating kernel manages memory run software large collection small utility program shell help knit program shell If needed shell script might write new utility C add utility library
This nice practical way working coincided rise various kind network today refer collectively Internet
So Unix spread Bell Labs academia large industrial system eventually leached water supply computing everywhere
And everywhere Unix went C sure go
C simple language simple like shotgun blow foot
It allows manage every last part memory file hard great meticulous dangerous sloppy
Software made C known fast
When compile C simply become bunch machine language one go many step making really ridiculously fast
These called optimization programming loophole tax
Think C sort grandfather grew trapping beaver served several war still pullups
C legendary lucid manual specification written Ritchie Brian Kernighan known nickname K R quick simple light comparison modern guide programming bookstore shelf
This recommended text published personal computing barely existed back computer large piece industrial equipment used control refrigeration system calculate actuarial table

By convention almost every introduction programming language since start variation Hello world Here computational Which compiled run print Hello world screen
Let write program give number x print square number sort practical useful program always appears programming tutorial address need people urgently require list square
To compile program Macintosh I saved opened typed And produced That run GNU C Compiler produce default file called I ran command line get squared number bully
If I wanted change code I would run command program would update accordingly
This great code stretch
You need squint little see small repeatable unit fit together certain way
There function called square
That important part
You feed number integer
Then count integer count print square number
Then print new line
Done
The Linux kernel written The software connects printer computer could The Web server serve Web page often written It also good language writing PHP Perl written C many others
C language use building system role computing Latin among Renaissance academic
You often meet serious practitioner digital art least passing familiarity
The serious scholar pretty fluent
But remember list popular language


C
Java
What many people code daily actually C one many Vulgates
Advocates language make various argument favor better large group programming These language say organize code library shareable reusable le likely cause pain suffering
These adaptation If going understand code work corporate environment need understand programming
There many definition
I wade provide face consequence
programming essence filing system code
As anyone ever shared networked organized physical filing without good shared filing system office implode
C people said great language
An excellent language
But really let organize thing
You end function
It mess
I mean data structure customer name address forth function manipulating data thing function related data except naming convention
C consistent way name thing
Which mean hard find later
programming gave programmer great way name mean building library
I could call run picture dog Internet address
That approach sloppy dangerous lead bug forebear reasoned without precedent make hard program big team keep track everything
So whaaaat made little box called Customer call class taxonomical sense like Customer subclass specie human subclass mammal etc
put data method relating customer box
And box literally anything inside relates particular class
I mean even need look inside box
You download large set class nested inside one another study available public method expected data start programming
Hey say let put data object take data
Every time new customer make new instance class
Code black box tentacle wire sticking need want inside box
You put couple box next touch tentacle together watch eldritch mating
This work well theory
The archetypal programming language Smalltalk created coterie genius Xerox PARC institution glorious glory day
After year gestation Smalltalk born year C gelled around
It inspired many big idea computer science also Platonism cell biology predecessor language called Simula first language per name designed simulate thing
While C created within New Jersey research facility Bell Labs industrial monolith AT T solve problem hand Smalltalk built California outpost different industrial monolith Xerox solve problem distant future
Thus Smalltalk represents world differently Smalltalk funny name friendly attitude specification ran page
It big system
C gave abstraction entire computer helping manage memory process inside machine
Smalltalk gave abstraction reality could start dividing world class method like
Where C tried make easier computer thing Smalltalk tried make easier human thing
This better worse
It different
Here Smalltalk code It print short sentence Transcript Window user screen
The Transcript receiving message Hello etc
You type select mouse even early tell computer execute
It compiles bit code add rest running system
It look like The thing box manipulated
They object
It almost powerful The boundary clear data code file executables operating system application closed open border fuzzed design
Smalltalk vision computer native medium
The whole system modified anyone
The dominant version called Squeak logo cute mouse modernized version called Pharo logo lighthouse
Both free easy download
As middling programmer I find Smalltalk environment fascinating never pull way looking glass
One day I promised I read skim intent huge Smalltalk specification seminal text grand attempt organize reality along computer principle
The problem Smalltalk requires one adopt method working also philosophy world everything organized hierarchy class
I love play I typically stumble back familiar approach
Being advocate Smalltalk little like Slovenian cinema free jazz
Some advocate particularly brilliant people
I one
Smalltalk history often described slightly tragic many best idea never permeated culture code
But still around still user anyone use Squeak Pharo
The number digital thing conceived still regular discussion quite small
It year Al Green
The world corrupts pure vision great idea
I pronounce Smalltalk raging wild global success
Python interesting language quite popular
It rigid
And widely understood easier C programmer use provides abstraction programmer reuse
It hide much weirdness computer many detail computation performed
Python usually slower C price pay sweet level abstraction
In vast majority case difference speed truly matter regardless much people protest
It consequence built system Python part run million billion time slowing thus requiring resource get work done
What
Does mean need throw away Python start language
Probably
Python deserved reputation glue language meaning take code language C Fortran yes year code close machine known sound write wrapper That embed older faster code newer slower system
A big part process wrapping old code nice Python function
In many way idiom language look also feel
Some language emphasize brevity
Some support long complex function others encourage break functionality small piece
Style usage matter sometimes programmer recommend Strunk White right one English language
Its focus efficient usage resonates programmer
The idiom language part communal identity
Python glue everything though
It hard connect Java fit C hand glove
There version Python designed run inside Java use Java code
That called Jython
If want version work Microsoft go IronPython
But another way interpret activity around Python People love want work everywhere everything
They spent ten thousand hour making possible given fruit labor away
That powerful indicator
A huge amount effort gone making Python practical well pleasurable use
There lot conference frequent code update vibrant mailing list
You pick language technical merit speediness job opportunity may present also culture
Python people generally pretty cool
There website dedicated language benchmark measuring fast certain language run compared others includes preface stave riot These compiler interpreter
These program could written
These task could solved
These tiny It sometimes appears everyone coding beef
You feel coming Web page
There lot defensive postscript added response outrage
People reacted strongly post read
I mean imply Java Languages agenda
People glom onto
Blunt talk seen good quality developer sign engineering mindset every opinion quickly possible sooner reach technical consensus
Expect told wrong expect tell people wrong
Masculine anger bluntly expressed part industry
Coding culture blurters
This yield fast decision penalizes people need quietly compose thought rewarding thinker harrumph efficiently
Programmer job interview often include abstract meaningless question must answered immediately whiteboard typify culture
Regular meeting become sniping match thing matter
The shorthand term Who care color bike shed painted
Well Code culture broad geographic cultural core Silicon Valley engine progress
The Valley mythologizes young genius vast sum
To credit culture work shame work everyone
At moment new thing could catch fire disrupt tribal ebb flow
Instagram written Python sold million Python moment glory
The next app could show written new start everyone taking seriously
Within month skill could quite valueless suspect
I meeting someone said How long take fix One person company year said Three A new person come world rapidly provisioned cloud microservices said Three They correct
That change enters world
Slowly first front page Hacker News
Programmers carve sliver cognitive territory go conference yet know position vulnerable
They get defensive hear someone suggest Python better Ruby insert message thread
Is next great wave swelling somewhere wash away Java come
Will Go conquer Python
Do I need learn JavaScript remain profitable
Programmers often angry often scared

That said industry undeniably attracts brilliant thinker
I met
You tell brilliant solution make laugh go Oh I would never thought The spark brain jump pretty wide gap
They know manual
Some people put time people help obsessed people damn smart revelation around
Dream programmer
But I hold hope one come work
You hire reason coach Chicago Bulls often called upon date supermodel preferred gender
They interviewing crappy company crappy job
They going come rescue website going make app put mustache photo going listen offer chance build next Facebook exist busy building real Facebook
Sometimes thinking higher mathematics help car manage ethical choice running squirrel driving cliff

It hard better life great programmer long unencumbered physical mental illness
Programming task reward intense focus done small group even isolation
It come association Asperger syndrome many programmer say somewhere spectrum though little obsessive seen good thing many coder
And job program successfully placed people autism spectrum programming career
But idea people Asperger make good programmer suspect idea woman naturally inclined coding assumption use term beloved Internet problematic deeply reductive
Tread lightly All kind people programmer
And autistic people kind career
If programmer exist require manager company
There shame
For truly gifted programmer writing code side effect thought
Their skill syntax perceive time computation
They see consequence action quickly next programmer spend le time dark
Their code still bug still need without flaw
But every candle three four flashlight map
As class programmer easily bored love novelty obsessed various form productivity enhancement
God help ever caught middle conversation nutrition standing desk best keyboard optimal screen position distance whether use plain text editor large complex development environment chair placement best music code best headphone whether headphone amplifier actually enhance listening whether office better individual shared office best software best programming methodology right way indent code proper placement semicolon course language better
And whatever never ever ask developer productivity software

It come small large
Meanwhile executive run large programming team actually ship software
Ship cult word
If ship time manager could get lower rating performance review end making inordinate opposed obscene amount money
Wine cellar risk mention alimony payment
As manager trust fall active reduce ship risk come many form bad bug feature promised boss client distract boring utterly necessary feature test server crash night
One greatest ship risk anything shiny
This language particularly risky
An experienced talented programmer learn language week middling one going take much longer
Meanwhile exciting interesting programming language always come list benison promise speed productivity happiness
No really
Happiness serious selling point language people written blog post analyze people discus code
According PHP coder far likely use word hate Reddit comment Clojure programmer Clojure programmer far likely use word cool PHP programmer
There many blog post persuade manager switch new language
Experienced manager bear scar often coder become practiced squinting coughing saying thing like No switching cost high right Maybe could trial project build analytics reporting Then programmer shuffle back standing desk complain product shipped
Or else quit Lord know job
For programmer particularly young one job everywhere
Managers old coder fewer option
It often better keep working shipping even code start look ugly even nominally better solution even technical debt accrues around year everything change
Maybe get promoted new manager motive tear everything cursing start perhaps using new language goal making something much simpler
Or entire industry spasm everything done need thrown away rebuilt along new line anyway
From desktop Web Web mobile mobile quantum
Who know
But always something
Somehow keep working
The industry always promising eat come paradigm perfect stop wasting time enter world pure digital thought
It never happens
Nine week asked TMitTB come office talk next step
You noticed team started dress like
One woman tall boot done something complex hair
She wearing black leather jacket
Nothing ostentatious cooler
She previously Patagonia
Is programmer dress
How get executive style
PHP say
The team good time PHP world
But I think thing might learned He pronounce bracket course approved expense write bracketed
It good good time cost send conference put hotel feed idea whether money well spent
really need move Oh
Well
There answer
We agreed PHP language next five Which one would say Ay rub say remind show real face right
If quote though Well ask language want use He look confused
I mean matter say
I write Then
And realize right answer one
One famous paper computing The Next Programming Languages
Landin talk language already cluttering computing landscape
It written academic journal wonderfully accurate opening statement Most programming language partly way expressing thing term thing partly basic set given It published
A language still u
Cobol example legendary extremely verbose language intimately linked year problem
As computer scientist Dijkstra described The use Cobol cripple mind teaching therefore regarded criminal While one sings praise except love Cobol still run mainframe
Fortran Formula Translating System John Backus LISP List Processor John McCarthy eventually lowercased Lisp UNIX became Unix developed day computer fed huge tape paper card still use today
The power granted Fortran inherent look almost comically computerish Much work come lazy
I like writing program I working IBM writing program computing missile trajectory I started work programming system make easier write Think That program wrote C page one print list square
You pick weird metallic smell large computer center raised floor looking Fortran
It excels numerical computing needed scientist still beat C task
Physicists astronomer like well live Fortran
Lisp though another kind beast
It emerged straight mathematical research
There many thing made Lisp peculiar
Some people say stand Lots superfluous Back Fortran programmer optimizing nuclear weapon yield Lisp programmer trying get robot pick teddy bear write sonnet
But one day people ran funding part world came yelled Shut pulled big red switch probably programmed Fortran
The Lisp programmer yet simulate human brain automatically produce great sonnet left regret
The Lisp machine company began shut sell asset
Students likely learn C Java
Lisp became cautionary tale unique unified vision computer fond memory better era
And yet There still quite bit Lisp world data system built ITA acquired Google
When Google flight nyc berlin ITA background running Lisp
There time Lisp looked deader ancient Greek beautiful philosophical system practical
Lisp blur line code data way allows function refer
It work little much ask regular programmer see world infinitely programmable
We need clarity
Which mean really need talk data
In interest understanding work open invitation TMitTB attend meeting programmer
Two late bravely ask one already attendance explain going
He quickly gather limit information series question beginning Do know Web page Here show To gather address name make Web page using HTML
Here change
And look like On today agenda How make sure registration positive experience user also secure experience company
The question discussed programmer tell along line Where put data
Will put text file
What
How act upon Enter remaining two programmer
Programmer A senior take place whiteboard
Let start Can define valid A via regular expression test
according RFC RFC
Let assume library OK
Do send everyone submits form confirmation message
We right
Is spec
No
Then
Well wait maybe update spec
It best practice
Can I say worry

We need check confirmation
Got
What really really worry temporary service right
Like allows give disposable address
So let anyone enter Mailinator address
Right one address
It like
So get list
There list actually
You go reload Mailinator page make list cross finger
Yeah looked
There list
Can rathole Mailinator talk overall security
I mean counting library validation good enough
No one going enter
Russians
Very possibly
But set upload limit right
Sort also allow people upload large image megabyte
So
No right
Those come lump someone could enter need check
I take want going relate overall database schema
Can catch database
That I take
Someone take picture whiteboard
Sure
And talk account expiration
Is spec
No dependency admin tool
Who owns
And go whiteboard whiteboard punctuated sound mobile phone fake camera shutter
Do need keep track many time How remove system What someone enters twice Programmer A leader seems professional
She whiteboard scribbling erasing scribbling erasing
Lists arrow box line
She wrote RUSSIANS
board
But hour realize This
One field
One little bit data
You even hit name yet
What user one name
What Bono Cher sign account
What Chinese Bono
Do want allow Chinese
What browser need support
Do call center people need able manage account
It hard think barrel cash burning
Programmer B entering thing tracking system creating issue assigning task people
A flurry assignment emerging meeting
Programmer C young annoying programmery others seem like well enough
How ensure credit card valid physical address real
Will perform financial transaction
Which external system integrate system
Who get sale report
We talk mailing list software
We talk password length number letter symbol necessary password secure whether password strategy site fit overall security profile company responsibility different division
So work
It go day
It get turned specification user story reviewed TMitTB right away conference tell overjoyed attended meeting
Not line code written throughout process
Data come everywhere
Sometimes come third import big pile music file record label
Sometimes data like tweet Facebook post Word document
Sometimes machine create data Fitbit exercise tracker Nest thermostat
When work coder talk data time
When create website need get data database put Web page
If Twitter tweet data
If IRS tax return data broken field
Data management problem programming supposed solve
But course computer everywhere keep generating data requires programming forth
It hell problem end sight
This people technology make much money
Not sell infinitely reproducible nothing sell many actually come new category infinitely reproducible nothing handle happened last batch
That ended big I conference packed
It rare large task ever far database
Amazon Google Yahoo Netflix huge powerful database
The prevalent relational database using language called SQL Structured Query Language
Relational database represent world using table row column
SQL look like Implying table called BOOKS row table book resides ID
IDs important database
Imagine bookstore database
It customer table list customer
It book table list book
And clever table purchase row every time customer bought book
Congratulations
You built Amazon
Of course trying build bookstore actually built death seems happen lot business
You set something cool end destroying lot thing came
Relational database showed never left
There Oracle course
Microsoft SQL Server IBM
They speak SQL work similar manner enough difference make costly switch
Oracle make pay thousand dollar use commercial enterprise database world run free software database PostgreSQL MySQL
There even tiny little database called SQLite small permissively licensed basically every smartphone available apps help save load data
You probably powerful database pocket right
If walk programmer say Big corporate programming think Java
Go popular coding job site search opening New York result Java recent search JavaScript Python Ruby
Only two Lisp
Java programming language born Sun Microsystems
product team led programmer named James Gosling
It also look lot like C people understood language fairly easy pick
It conceived eventually floating onto Internet massive cloud marketing proclaimed answer every woe ever beset programmer
Java ran every computer
Java would run right inside Web browser applet soon called crapplets would probably take Web time
Java
It ran slowly compared traditional language What
Java
They also computer terminal called JavaStations
Java
Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers even announced million Java fund
But excitement Java sort hung
The future look like Sun said would
Java running inside Web browser never worked well
It slow clunky loaded felt like teetering edge disaster paranoia frequently validated browser froze crashed
jewelry meant serve kind digital card also low success rate
But Java free download designed useful small large team alike
Here fact Java help understand slowly took world sheer power pretty good
It big language
It came ton code already class library class method need talk database deal complex document mathematics talk various network service
There ton class library waiting turned object brought life
It automatically generated documentation
This huge
Everyone say code deserves excellent documentation documentation truly matter principle mostly proven breach
Now could run tool called would make Web page listed class method
It lousy documentation better nothing pretty easy enhance took time clean code
There lot Java manual workshop training seminar certification
Programmers take class test officially certified many technology
Java programmer especially wide range choose
It ran virtual machine meant Java ran everywhere meant could run Windows Mac Unix machine would behave
It exceptionally compromise
Which made perfect big company
As kept going Java became popular application server
Creating content management system nongovernmental organization employee
Java fine
Connecting ten thousand people company one another
Java
Need help one bank talk another bank every day
Java
Charts diagram big stack paper project
Java
Not exciting hardly wearable predictable
A language building great big thing great big place great big team
People complain work
Of course Microsoft intolerable
You company creeping bank enterprise dumb language
You people choosing run stuff virtual machine running Windows machine God Bill Gates intended
Don ever count Microsoft
Its great corporate skill always take sheer weirdness computer idea translate corporation language Global Business Leadership
Whatever discussed issue Microsoft offer least one
Statically typed scripting ambiguous adjective Microsoft sell something delivers write Windows code live Windows life
And disparagement Microsoft product good better anything else market
Enterprise feared word among programmer enterprise programming lot work without much show
Remember first version total disaster
Perfect example enterprise coding
At time programmer respect big work
We respect ambition huge heavy machine running big blob code
We grew reading supercomputer
Big iron cool even future seems huge cloud platform hosting ton cheap computer
But Java also wide use Google
It language place General Electric Accenture
These startup product schedule slip revenue beholden public market
Gigantic organization structured around code around getting software made
But mean team example famous rule Never meeting two pizza feed entire These company culture know make software
They whole department dedicated testing
The process important many moving piece many invisible
Academic researcher often produce thing basically work interface
They need prove thesis publish move next thing
People free software community often code scratch itch release code digital common people modify manipulate
While often process go nowhere time project capture imagination others become part infrastructure world
Java interestingly profit
It designed big corporate project infrastructure support
It also useful language midsize task
So library need processing logging file appearing steady clip improving standard library supplanting entirely
Eventually people realized like Java language could write language compile Java bytecode run Java virtual machine JVM
So many language run top Java
Some version language Jython JRuby
Others totally new like Scala one language Twitter began use outgrew Ruby
There also Clojure Lisp
That Clojure take computer language born update give language ability reuse Java class world
Clojure created Rich Hickey decided wanted new modern version Lisp
Lisp may old language still revered classic model thought like Braun shaver Eames chair mind
Hickey worked Clojure many year eventually adapting run JVM
This dramatic choice meant Clojure access entirety Java class library
Now walk office sit computer write little code elegant trim comfortable access thousand thousand incredibly totally functional free library use get work done
Anything Java Clojure
And since built atop JVM computer
There already Lisp editing tool pretty easy modify Clojure
It joined Java like remora shark
Or accurately remora attached remora JVM fake machine running inside real machine
Clojure beloved widely used
Perhaps become popular
It show interesting place
It used Stores collect manage receipt data example
It ported world Microsoft run right inside Excel
It craziest thing
Take spreadsheet
Inside spreadsheet Clojure code running away addressing different cell column
Someone made version compiles well transpiles JavaScript blam Clojure running Web browser
Actually version called ClojureScript
The point thing fluid world programming fluid way industry seem
Languages liquid infrastructure
You download program whoa suddenly working Clojure environment
Which actually Java Runtime Environment
You grab old PC outlived usefulness put Linux suddenly powerful Web server
Now participate whole new culture
There meetups gathering conference blog people chatting Twitter
And welcomed
They glad new blood
Java supposed supplant C run smart jewelry
Now run application server host Lisplike language core language Android operating system
It run billion thing
It
C designed supplant also
A lot thing keep winning computer keep getting plentiful
It weird
A week later office meeting ask TMitTB way use component way buy way
He make face
Sort say making system integrate system around company set system nothing truly shelf
There tool package library wit already use free code thing validation obviates much
Everything edge case say
Testing edge You come conclusion The world broken
Remember Netscape first huge commercial Web browser
In Java blooming Netscape resolving problem
It displayed Web page lively
You could nice cartoon monkey Web page way make monkey dance moved mouse
Figuring make happen job language developer named Brendan Eich
He sat week created language called JavaScript
JavaScript relationship Java tenuous strongest bond language marketing linkage name
And early history JavaScript uninspiring
So monkey could dance
You could thing cursor make thing blink mouse touched
But browser proliferated Web grew platform platform JavaScript became arguably widely deployed language runtime world
If wrote JavaScript code could run wherever Web
JavaScript puttered around year wilderness Java
But without resolute support corporate entity like Sun
Then decade ago people began talk Ajax idea could build real software Web page document program could real work
Things could respond change according input
You could distribute software hundred million people way JavaScript would work
It controlled Java much slower natively compiled C terrible lack nicety
And yet Gmail Google Maps Flickr Twitter Facebook
Every single pixel Web page manipulated type changed word move around button pressed
As celebrity whole industry dedicated spackling deficiency making look good
There book good part JavaScript library make easier consistent program jQuery turn many line code necessary make paragraph disappear single
Back era iPod Macintoshes Apple took code Web browser called Konqueror modified create Safari Web browser compete Microsoft Internet Explorer
Then Google started make modification Web engine underneath Safari called Webkit made version called Chrome JavaScript engine called
They made JavaScript fast
Devs still approach performance JS code riding horse cart tweeted one developer horse long replaced fusion Google better JavaScript fast
In developer named Ryan Dahl modified engine free software made run outside browser
There freestanding version JavaScript including ran inside Java natch none fast
He called fork took
One day JavaScript ran inside Web page
Then broke browser prison
Now could operate anywhere
It could touch hard drive send erase file
It real programming language
And client become server
Here JavaScript squaring number In great sudden wave thousand developer began use create modular library
If knew JavaScript worked Web page could make work server
And interesting characteristic language made good writing software handle lot simultaneous user
JavaScript listened lot thing Web browser A mouse move key typed information come network
On server could listen dozen hundred people give information requested
Soon community developed huge library software specific thing reading file chattering database talking Amazon Web service tool
At writing package billion copy various package downloaded past month
NPM stand Node Package Manager
It software help install package well unwieldy honestly many package great
It lot searching testing sighing
But much stuff pick free complain
JavaScript hodgepodge designed hurry run well know let say device might well get program
Your customer may iPhones probably way running JavaScript
So might use JavaScript make interesting Web page
You might use make application like Google Docs run browser
You might use make Web server talk Web browser
Or might use make API serf data client sure client could laptop Web browser
But client quite probably app smartphone
You get site running PHP minute problem
It used terrible choice made needed get something done Web increasingly JavaScript replaced default terrible choice
PHP stand Personal Home Interpreter
The idea loaded Web page PHP code would run page went Internet
And PHP could say check whether logged
If could show top secret account detail could say Please log I know lot people program PHP smart good people
PHP power Etsy Facebook
It power Wikipedia God sake
WordPress
Out Web page enormous percentage created PHP
Coding PHP living death sentence
Lots people gotten rich PHP
It mean lot cutting pasting lot trip Google figure thing working
Poor sad misbegotten incredibly effective massively successful PHP
Reading PHP code like reading poetry poetry wrote freshman year college
I spent many hundred maybe thousand hour programming PHP back I know I neither PHP
Reloading Web page finger sore
I hear sympathetic sob
Everything always broken people always hacking site
PHP
I wish harm
I glad see well done
We good time together
I ever want go back
One privilege owning Mac download program Apple called Xcode
This IDE Integrated Development Environment
It enormous download gigabyte roughly size hour video
Xcode heart Apple
It company writes software tool everyone want write software Mac iPhone
Within Xcode whole world explore
For example one component iOS SDK Software Development Kit
You use make iPhone iPad apps
That SDK made dozen dozen APIs Application Programming Interfaces
There API keeping track user location one animating picture one playing sound several rendering text screen collecting information user
And forth
Maybe starting see strand
Remember way Smalltalk environment worked screen bunch window
There powerful echo Xcode
There way tend code text editor black background far le see first glance though actually right serious code life
You fill field wire thing together really sometimes done connecting virtual wire virtual hole start coding
When someone Apple stand onstage announces new thing end Kit ResearchKit WatchKit set routine specifically Apple kit land fully documented used make software
Some function reserved manufacturer
You know Apple touting track someone heartbeat using Apple Watch
Apple documented yet world
Maybe company worried misuse somehow
Perhaps heartbeat monitoring requires careful battery management watch already battery issue Apple want avoid making thing worse letting anyone
It likely people trying figure access heartbeat API right though
That way people
Apple really good
It publishes interface guideline give people tool arranging app interface predictable way end user find familiar
It set flow go
Let say making podcasting application playing audio file key feature
Great
Create object class AVAudioPlayer add button screen connect button code clicked button sends message There lot going want leave operating system keep track window
It IDE help connect idea massive massive world ten thousand method play song rewind song keep track song played meaning also need aware time zone keep track title song mean need aware language song know display
You also know length song mean need mechanism extracting duration music file
Once need divide get minute
But song podcast minute long
Do want divide get hour
So many variable
Gah
I guess problem solve
The IDE everything
The greatest commercial insight technology industry control computing environment move market
You change way people thing way listen music watch video respond advertising
People work technology company supposed take idea multiply million people yielding billion dollar
A great way wrap intention APIs SDKs IDEs
That much software make software free It stimulates development even software
Sometimes result corporate ambition Java much Sun product class library true C Microsoft
But much code world freely available created generous volunteer decade serve need
The corporation programming language complex
Some language developer hired work language Go Python funded varying degree Google creator PHP work Etsy
Most commonly used button Usually list grid Used filtering Mac Finder Mail Designed toolbars Usage mystery Used toggle button New style push button indicator Apple Microsoft Amazon Google factory factory
Their APIs product many thousand hour labor many programmer
Think work involved
Someone need manage SDK
Hundreds programmer need write code
People need write documentation organize demo
Someone need fight feature get funded finished
Someone need make sure translation German completed embarrassing mistake go viral Twitter
Someone need actually write software go making IDE work
The modern OS feast wonder fast video music player bucket button
Apple may best imaginary button maker history
Just bezel work behold
Today bezel style NSThickSquareBezelStyle NSSmallSquareBezelStyle
Freedom
Sort
They still bezel
Things used require labor map rotating giant done line code
When everyone go Apple annual Worldwide Developers Conference San Francisco stare rapturously man untucked expensive shirt talk core data context
Onstage presenting Kits Apple rearranging abstraction saying Look new reality defined way difficult thing easy drab thing colorful
Your trust platform dedication thousand hour time misplaced
They pitched variation annually year
In Xcode compile everything one command pop software testing
You see button made
You need click
It yearns click
It cry shrill signaling voice like nano cat microfence
Everything inside computer beseeches everything else
It racket
You click mouse button cat finally satisfied
Now computer increase volume change color bring talking paper clip
Destiny fulfilled many round test complete
When app done may sell app store
And user excited use app motivated buy apps
Loops upon loop feeding one another capital accruing coffer patient software giant
An ecosystem
Ecosystem another debased word especially given keep real physical one around u
But hundred thousand people raising kid making thing million people call
Odds kind programming especially Web programming adopted framework
Whereas SDK expression corporate philosophy framework like product pitch
Want save time
Tired writing old code
Curious next new thing
You use graphic framework build graphical application Web framework build Web application network framework build network server
There hundred framework every language one
Django Reinhardt guitar virtuoso namesake Django framework A popular Web framework Django used coding Python
Instagram bootstrapped
When sit first time Django run command make directory file configuration inside
This project directory
Now access library service add enhance library
Suppose still making bookstore Amazonesque one relational database started page back
With Django run command
You might tell start app called bookstore
Then set model meaning start define data look using Python idiom framework translate
So make book catalog
Obviously need add author like
The incredibly neat thing line configuration completely functional working article editor wit That called admin view always main feature Django
Your work programmer started soon moment conception building publishing platform alpha tester maybe testing frame start play baby entering book trying thing
Take moment
You learn programming language like Python
You need make website allows dozen people enter data
You write line Python code set account people using admin start enter data
If time get good sort work
You get team started project hour
Remember issue entering address
If use Django use many taken care
Ditto many security concern arise building website typical abuse people perpetrate
You entered pool many thousand programmer share framework use suggest improvement write tutorial write used accomplish task related password blogging managing spam providing calendar accelerating site creating discussion forum integrating service
You think term architecture
Magnificent
Wonderful
So downside
Well framework lock way thinking
You look website trained eye go Oh Ruby Rails Frameworks obvious influence kind work developer
Some people feel framework make thing easy become crutch
It pretty easy code hole find trying force framework something want
Django example right tool building giant chat application would want try competing Google Docs using Django backend
You pay price speed control convenience
The problem really knowing much speed control convenience need
Programmers talk premature optimization code know real problem describe people overthink programming architecture There another tendency NIH invented come lot
Frameworks feel little insulting anticipate problem used thousand people
They imply common everyday problem rather special amazing mystery require true genius solve
The opinion framework strong strong SDK
Those tightly bundled often commercial arrive PR trumpet blasting especially Apple Microsoft
Frameworks tend derived frustration first release bound tape thrust onto Web blog post
From
There Web application framework every major language show almost different framework Java alone almost PHP
Most good framework free released solve problem bring glory influence creator rather great rich control
They spread organically
People see video tutorial showing make blog minute
Then copy work say That easy show friend
Websites go live programmer talk quickly developed said website
If building Web app fool use Web framework first
There tiny one control freak focused URL routing massive one like Django Rails pursue goal first outlined large system Smalltalk day yore enable development large collaborative system data manipulated shared
Take work done
DRY repeat
In programming many way destroy something create something
One stray character required
Say forget semicolon use accented é somewhere code prepared
Or add two thing together one numeral string might use say blackbird baked To computer numeric significance
This sort thing really happens part job remembering
Programming debugging
It expectation thing work
This something people bring like bring medical history first date
Most language construct built catching failure trapping like wild animal examining well exterminating
In time relationship programming language blossom come realize truly characterizes language tell broke
Most programming life spent trying figure broke computer help maybe watch kid play soccer
When I started programming I felt time program crashed I failed
I found cringing desperate unable move forward
There even novel Ellen Ullman anxiety social complexity arise serious bug hard find
Eventually though I learned submit
I let drift computer remember math I know thing I understand type category list syntax
Sometimes bug cause error message pop sometimes cause program give ghost quit suddenly sometimes get caught terrible loop fill memory choke resource computer restarted
That called stack overflow
Sometimes request go hard example calling many time stack finite resource fill take anymore
Hence name website Stack Overflow programmer go answer question help solve bug
It website world trailing Craigslist spot
Randomly selected item Stack Overflow give taste programming Angular embedding nested
view working TheOncomingCode seems saying using AngularJS framework JavaScript another piece code called
Judging name latter help set route address component user help manage view data
But wait turn actually Oh man
I went looked tool describes Yeoman generator modular AngularJS apps Gulp optional Polymer support I mean come hell
But know
In pound
Let
A search Yeoman say scaffolding tool mean make little folder Web apps help get started programming
Useful
We know Angular framework
Gulp website say automate enhance You intuit using context clue tool help build software
Somehow
You never know salmon background site sometimes simply get tired
Polymer Web component library mean give little reusable code component use Web drawer menu button etc
OK
So know combination Angular Yeoman Gulp Polymer somehow working TheOncomingCode
All thing tool designed make easier code
But introduce complexity
This person trying make Web browser something JavaScript crapping
Someone came answer question
To able use header state home state wrote Stack Overflow user Matt Tester need nested chained
So obvious safely make one state parent another separate way registration So
There go
That solves
JavaScript right
Too much know today useless six month
Every factoid absolute best principled way use language fetid zoo garbage end year
And sniveling bearded looking slightly right pale eye awkwardly mumbling Yeah wow say lot Gulp Angular I guessing use Fleejob Grimmex Snurt extension

I sure gon na like working Anyway one question Stack Overflow
More month go
Nothing built
The old website remains showing age infuriating everyone
Pressure mount
Pressure
The failed
The new CTO charlatan
TMitTB apparently spent time conference time actually working
These thing spoken loud kind company
Things said eye roll shrug hallway ordering address via BCC
You let antenna work
You hear word boondoggle late phrase like operationally There lot compliance governance
Earlier career might panicked
Instead feel sense calm
You call CTO TMitTB office soon back vicinity
They come looking sheepish
The CTO braced shoulder firm
TMitTB oscillates sheepish angry
People believe say pointing upward time cut loss shut If hover near programmer hear talk writing test passing test
Some even program written test code hope write must pas
This called design
Tests code course
They check function code
They run hope automatically find day work break thing
Relentless testing one way keep eye make sure person bug bug find one wintry night everyone home fireplace crash server right Christmas setting kind automated alarm forcing programmer terrible apology loop deeply annoyed spouse
One piece code world called SQLite database mentioned earlier probably smartphone
It developed Richard Hipp working year
It totally open totally free test
It one widely used piece software one respected
Bugs original sin programming
They part life like unwanted body hair political campaign
The original sin programming people code new feature trying jam change main codebase ready
Automated testing way head bug also way suggest write respectable code code earns salute
In opinion version control one beautiful thing programming
It one code culture gift world
Version control like track change Microsoft Word
That shameful monstrosity make even powerful computer stutter something lawyer could love
No version control something different
What I told Go could record every change made many many document go codebase Well interesting
I mean I could use kind thing
I could use find bug entered system example
record made minute permanent record Well powerful
I could use review progress team making I manager looking change every day
every change could reviewed anyone totally transparent way Everyone keep change understand code evolving
Every change
bundle change turn branch anyone make many branch needed without violating integrity branch I say sound like insane fantasy
Someone completely change code without interfering work others
could merge finished branch back main trunk code reviewing fixing inconsistency go My God like hear inside brain
So even though code huge pile fragile interdependent component I code team working branch I spent time solid testing suite appropriate time merge change run automated test make sure everything still working
everyone history every change ever made code even codebase decade old
Shut shut take everything disembodied code voice take everything
Take
completely totally free download default way distributing source code throughout world
And everyone get excited GitHub
You go GitHub really
You poke around look thousand repository read README file
And look code look commits
A commit moment action captured stored
You compare one commit another see diff see added removed
See figure
Take look screen shot
First looking Django repository
This actual code make Django Web framework run
It people keeping eye people starred favorite people copied code repository intention manipulating adding changing
These number represent invested user
There likely hundred thousand downloaded code use
We see user claudep
He five hour ago adding commit message read Fixed filename max He working file called mean particular new code marked green prefixed beginning line probably either test code code support test
And thanks user claudep code better six hour ago
This experience using version control
It combination news feed backup system
GitHub invent version control
It took program called git developed first Linus Torvalds chief architect Linux started adding tool service around
The way git work copy code change ever made code one command That copy code local machine
Now go change code heart delight
When done changing type add file changed asks enter commit message explaining done cause error think come start pushing code node repository
But permission would push change master branch git repository hosted GitHub
These command part sense memory many programmer
They type variation dozen time day checking code keep record work done rewind point go deep screw many thing
Sometimes change pile point look say This good
We ready release new code Maybe every two week maybe year
Maybe like Facebook time
If software Version could bundle change tag code
Behold Version
A change come second later coder far away matter Version
You done Version
Version part permanent record
You might fix bug call Version
You might add another feature call Version
Tools git give programmer common language
Did check ask
Which commit That going pushed Because commit get unique identifier pinpoint commit space time feel confident record code change way rarely feel confident anything
A side effect confidence increased automation
Let say Web server program popular serf hundred million people every month
It run different computer cloud
Aren something
Your diligent decentralized team frequently writes new code run server
So problem What best way get code onto computer
Click drag mouse
God
What animal
You set continuous integration server install let robot serve
Programmers hardly talk code
They chat data
They chat requirement interesting approach
And chat constantly deployment
Which make sense goal code brain testing world Web app form
Programmers good one want ship move next problem
So lot policy ton deploying fresh code
For example See test version control trigger actually shipping code
If follow process like release software several time day software would folly
Often build done nightly big build server one would come next morning get score
But software released via Web app store wait
Why continually release software every day whenever something ready go
I mean company everything imaginable slow shipping TMitTB say CTO wince
That fine expected stressful meeting
First I needed pas everything security team five month review TMitTB say took week get working development environment I developer sneaking Starbucks check code
You listen way listened people criticize project
But people promised new exciting way working would cut problem experienced failed technology initiative yore
They would agile would use new tool would attract talent would ship code
They knew big company startup signed
And casual observer failure
TMitTB noticed gained weight
The CTO several project roughly footing scattered across organization lost weight
I told I could I right TMitTB say
So need done month He sits back chair shallow visitor chair lightly padded back intended dramatic effect diminished
One lesson TMitTB tried get across big message matter code never done shipping new platform longer website platform interlocking component team continue work forever
There always new bug new feature new need
Such thing side effect growth platform insists designed scale
What one engineering understand perceive static exhausting enemy corporate world surround world static
yes battleship leave port
What coder seeing come believe staid enterprise world fear consequence apathy rather détente
They see stability
Where see obstacle intransigence see huge complex dynamic system flow river money people deeply afraid move anything would dam river
You feel pity coder
Obviously inherit earth
But race summit missed lot memo
I want ship TMitTB say
By mean I want I asked But much company hears I want destroy everything I touch
For I Kali destroyer best OK say
I understand
Here going You look CTO nod
First His mouth open shuts
He afraid realize understand work see software thing golden braid forever weaving
But coming around
Finding way programmer meeting
It like smartphone constant update
Nothing ever done
That fine
You let help optic continue
I need every day walking hall big smile face
Giving
Looking sleepy
Second I need release date real Next The CTO say name shake head
We work say
For conference
And talk sprint
Don talk milestone release
Talk people platform exists working month
Ask updated product The time
The CTO asks TMitTB We clear Yes TMitTB say
He fact ask question indicates might learning
He done lot work time get corporate pretend work
And pick language ask
This
We TMitTB say
We using
With Express Great say
Can wait see Beware argument related programming speed
All thing equal faster better
But thing never equal
Do need kind speed let get website running quickly
Or kind allows rotate thousand polygon real time
Do need convert PDFs text per hour
Or million PDFs text
These different problem
What need many time need existing code use help u many time
Ask question
It possible spend productive month preparing project without deciding language
It may sign fine manager someone assumes people learn new thing someone built agile team capable experimenting new technology getting idea production
It could also person totally useless
You find
Let say programmer developing huge website serf million people visit five time month
Do use Python slower Go fast something
Trick question
million Web page visit big deal unless involve deep wizardry complex database query different page good example Facebook
Now number trivial take minute make page need year make many way slow
If take second make page still million second month
So need figure serve page per second
You probably want one computer little redundancy good server setup
It take planning
But done language
What going serve hundred thousand page month
Then got tremendous breathing room
You need many engineer create system architecture
You still need plan general read blog post follow along others done
You pretty sloppy honest
Again language
What want include live chat page expect thousand people use chat speaking
Now dipping hand godforsaken river
But exactly problem Go designed solve
It language creating highly available server use much computer processor possible
It feature well Go shine
Actually work pretty well sort server Clojure certainly capacity
Oh right Java work
If really needed could even PHP
This choice hard
Everything everything people tell use everything everything
So need figure kind team kind framework like using people productive stick around completion project
This hard
Most place
So go lowest common know people leave able get
And OK
The vast majority technology project require original research require amazing technological discovery
All language discussion work fine
There great coder
But choice main programming language important signaling behavior technology company engage
Tell program Java I believe either serious boring
In Ruby interested building thing quickly
In Clojure I think smart wonder ship
In Python I trust implicitly
In PHP sigh together
In C I nod humbly
In C I smile assume nothing common
In Fortran I ask see security clearance
These language contain entire civilization
You tell well code organized across room
Or squinting zooming
The shape code foot away incredibly informative
Clean code idiomatic brief possible obvious even heavily documented
Colloquial friendly
As written aka SICP seminal textbook programming taught year MIT A computer language way getting computer perform operation novel formal medium expressing idea methodology
Thus program must written people read incidentally machine A great program letter current future person inherits code
A generous humanistic document
Of course nice flowery need work
One day go pen keep programmer
Their standup start hold cup coffee
They actually stand
Mostly men woman
They go around room person say yesterday plan today blocker
Most people office standup person people traveling chat
Two people dialed new hire Boston Hungary strong accent
They tell story rest
Yesterday I worked account deletion user story Boston say
Number
Today I writing unit test account deletion code
I blocked
I nominate Istvan go The line unmutes thick Hungarian accent say Yes yesterday I worked catalog admin tool product upload
I completed image upload feature
Today I also write unit test
I TMitTB say Istvan update JIRA JIRA commercial service function official record project
It strange hear thing approve line item discussed real actual thing
But also pleasing
On Wikipedia page list link page TDD BDD FDD DDD MDD development development design Each one advocate critic
I include amusement
If want go deeper management methodology
The management programmer discipline unto
There subdisciplines deal coder communicate
The prominent Agile methodology call regular coordination among programmer providing set ritual norm follow make program work program others
The yep manifesto read follows There signatory
And many variation Agile
I terrible meeting life I sat two team one explained length Agile Kanban better Agile Scrum
You could smell money burning
Here Agile I seen done You break product set user story need
You file story system often commercial product JIRA
You divide work sprint week two week whatever suit management style give sprint name goal implement search user registration programmer take story go make happen
Every day team check try unblock one working tool sends server working tell everyone
Then someone else step help stick story best everyone need working toward sprint goal trying release software
And sprint done deliver something actually really work move next thing slowly bringing large complex system operation
That ideal case
Done well avoids magical thinking It work get everything done wired together
It critic seem many branch
Scrum Kanban Agile Discipline Protestantism
Programmers forever searching silver bullet worse always think found
Which Frederick Brooks famous early software methodologists wrote paper called No Silver Accident Software He wrote
He hopeful back programming would help fix thing
Into office come TMitTB
He hold large bottle sort laptop look sleepy
You tell smile
We got release say
Ran little last He open laptop brings secret website assures seen within confines office network via virtual private network
It plain homely thing new website
Squares bumping square
The catalog item catalog screen image
The text sort weird character strange bug
There product name fake product real product I hate There related item purchase even though critical feature one major revenue driver current site
You suppress question
It
There however way log username password
TMitTB done favor creating account
You say first nonengineering person test site
This real ask
Yes
This software
It speaks database
This Does speak customer service He squint second
In July say
My God date
You extracted month something positively
He asked
He managed outward began gum work familiar way
He started demanding document people immediately began providing
He asked relative stranger insight suggestion gave willingly
They asked logo bigger
They asked game could played inside app
He listened
He conference month
So real actual Yes say taking sip complicated fermented beverage label
A sticker bottle say Now next sprint say
We push July
And release He look tired man
But also look proud
The thing team put used good modern tool
That craft pleasure TMitTB made possible work
We finally say going They standups
And standups go work integrated development environment write JavaScript JavaScript
Then run test check code source code repository continuous integration server perform test check go well deploy even August cloud another
They insist every day continuous release
Then come report
Revenue report analytics list new market conquer manner new customer data parcel distribute
That role owner global database customer intent
Thousands million new fact help company plan sale product development cycle
A good thing
And hope new site generate revenue faster better deployed across platform Web mobile Web multiple apps
You decided cut BlackBerry support
It stung three BlackBerrys desk drawer home none pocket
Life move
When site introduced buy coder cake send JavaScript conference choice
You learned appropriate reward people write JavaScript JavaScript
TMitTB get bonus
The CTO already considering new thing
You like CTO
She become friend sort
You feel S distance coming toward
It arrive due time stick front VP title well
The coder smile hall sat code review feature discussion stood quietly middle standups
You know name even could better job pronouncing
Perhaps future software
I spoke friend spent career technology
I complaining
I said I mentor millennials God
Every job contract position
Nothing come health care
They carry much They looked perplexity
It took moment one said Not You probably already code
You Excel Google Spreadsheets
You run little process sequence series routine big document
Programming career lead rewarding solidly existence
If inclined enjoy work good way spend time work good people dry part something teach
Of course true place smart people work
If situation lousy probably find another job easily say writer
The industry twist turn often though know next year bring
The iPhone mobile general created brief renaissance people could program using language people could worry computer memory
Perhaps Internet Things turn everything sensor
Already wander Disney World wristband watch track whole place computer
This require yet thinking
And website make apps build
There likely work
But global industry thousand people India great degree
Some used work Microsoft Google IBM
The thing made programming massive ship nothing charge perfect globalized industry
There simply reason aside prejudice think Mumbai Seoul make big complex thing well Palo Alto Seattle
You might learn program new economy irrational weird painful old one
Books song row database whole film made CPUs without real ray light penetrating lens
Maybe learning code give decoder ring future
Disruption optimization another name
SDKs culture encoded made reproducible entire generation received rapturously Beatles album decade ago
The Marc Andreessen wrote software eating world
If true least know hungry
I man taupe blazer sure person brings digital welcome certain way better
It took long time learn might executive editor librarian might enjoy hearing entire world upended someone new toy pocket
I put toy anyone pocket kill messenger
But messenger blameless either
Aside serious fever occasional trip wood I used computer every day year
I learn world software
I learned publishing using desktop publishing system QuarkXPress I learned color art using program called Deluxe Paint
Software taught math basic statistic
It taught calculate great circle distance estimating distance two point globe
I learned Internet creating Web page I learned music MIDI
And software taught software
I like cheap old computer new one laptop creak open
My house filled book soft nondigital thing
But first thought I accomplish personal professional task What code I use
What software teach I need know
When I want learn something software exists vacuum bug someone
This Silicon Valley must thinking optimizes hell every industry making software keeper software middleman
The Valley world sight
Government industry social service human sexuality agriculture They want get influence whole shebang
Code atomized entire category existence previously appeared whole
Skilled practitioner turned explosive ability near total benefit
Bookstores exist opposition Amazon Amazon interpretation electronic book reference point world
For part Amazon really bookseller much set optimization problem around digital physical distribution
Microsoft Office defined work leading multidecade deluge PowerPoint
Uber seek recast transportation image thousand startup exist star eye feverish disrupt disrupt disrupt disrupt
I happy lived greatest capital expansion history era entirety specie began speak awkwardly digital abstraction venture capitalist waddle around like mama bird dropping blog post seed round mouth waiting baby bird developer certain grow billionaire
It comedy ego made possible logic gate
I smart enough rich I always entertained
I hope
Hello world
writer programmer life Brooklyn
He founding partner company New York City build Internet platform develops interactive product
He writing book essay Web page Farrar Straus Giroux publish
His article appeared issue

Not bad six seven keep perspective
Software may eating world world previously eaten thing rise telephone system spread electricity absolute domination automobile
It miraculous mobile phone equally miraculous charge
The world code filled acronym
K modeled another language called APL stand A Programming Language
Programmers funny like uncle
They hold recursive highest regard
Another classic GNU mean GNU Not Unix
Programmer joke make laugh sigh
Or sigh
Compilation one denser subject computer science lower go opportunity deep weird thing speed code faster cheaper better
You write elegant code like Scott Fitzgerald computer compile Ernest Hemingway
But compiler often several pass turning code simpler code simpler code still Fitzgerald Hemingway Stephen King Stephenie Meyer way Dan Brown phase getting le readable repetitive go
I find code printed page hard read
I blame eye blur
I try read lot code make sense computer could conceivably change part mess around
Every I find gem utility program Unix source code often amazingly brief simple obvious everything hope system pride made simple composable element
Adobe created PostScript early licensed Apple first success
decade later Adobe valued billion
PDF direct descendant PostScript PDFs everywhere
In code life idea grow inside language spread
Two plus two usually equal four language like JavaScript add answer
That number interpreted floating point point period JavaScript language us particular way representing number memory sometimes entirely predictable rounding error
This one thing know committed Web programmer
Well might said
It attributed might folklore
Nonetheless great quote
Meaning company huge use much prepackaged code rest u rather need rebuild thing tight specification
By way earlier assertion single fit barrel
It come calculation made Wolfram Alpha search engine work well quantity
The search US dry US dollar banknote result
User story often written paper card arranged wall also computerized card moved around mouse assigned programmer
Programmers spend much time dealing different type data
Let say I number x like word like When I multiply x result
A runtime error many multiply number word
The language Perl return zero expedient baffling JavaScript return NaN I know I know
How often going multiplying seven cat
Soooo much
The real world data messy constantly converting one type thing another shading subtle
Sometimes address bunch letter symbol sometimes field plucked database sometimes specially prepared sent Internet
Programmers write lot code convert data one type another
Some language incredibly vigilant type done data given type
They push hard programmer nail data type payoff language identify problem compile time instead later program running
A statically typed language like Java catch multiply poem try find geographic distance Chicago Social Security number
Other language far caveat programmer
A kernel lowest level operating system
The Linux kernel like engine car dashboard windshield tire seat come variety source
The Free Software Foundation asks call honor root people follow suggestion
Most people call Linux though refer one Linux distribution Red Hat Enterprise Linux Ubuntu Server It worth noting Linux hardly Unix OpenBSD FreeBSD Solaris AIX get drift
The chart showing Unices large chart
If old enough remember DOS know command line
Disclosure I written line C code life though I read lot language worked many tutorial
As Web person I kind system work excels
If work large software hardware company far likely find use
imperative functional paradigm language like Python referred Writing article nightmare I know matter many people review I missed something thread reader pull say He missed essence I know ashamed advocate
I accept
I know I describe compilation tiny strand subject I know way I characterize programming language reductive
This supposed brief article became brief book
So apology anything absolutely
They gave one magazine
If want rant I
It balance
You also want create situation engineer play around set system behind back That Linux spread
Technical debt idea software often launch without everything buttoned meet deadline feature prioritized others time system change evolve kind build
It different infrastructure debt
Bridges tunnel new thing compatible way require painful wasted effort
Sometimes move system forward need address debt Upgrade balky server deal fact user account manager tends log people without warning occasionally throw away component start
You know though
Cobol great language
If spend lot time formatting date currency forth got
If curious search Cobol Picture Different computing era smelled differently
The old huge machine slight smell
Early PCs gave different odor plastic metal enamel
And could forget wafting scent monitor smoke pouring back
The aroma dozen people computer center deadline
The odd smell laser toner massive pile pulpy striped paper
Occasionally I see picture pile old machine olfactory memory jump
Lisp language programmer venerate rich history fact simplicity make possible Lisp program described programmable programming If ever bright programmer need challenge send learn Lisp
Some may return insufferable evangelist likely come back smarter flexible
Enjoying Lisp programming like enjoying prog rock expressionist art probably love bad square hate parenthesis
Remember computer memory kind like straight line programmer think tree
That Lisp nutshell give incredibly consistent way think tree
It close Zen computing get
Of language essay Lisp one I take desert island
It teach hidden order universe
HyperText Markup Language encoding format Web page since Web began
Programmers argue whether HTML programming paranoid status want allow mere claim blessed programmer status
So text appears count code The difference expert markup person expert coder experience somewhere favor programmer
When people talk database often use acronym CRUD create read update delete
You might create book customer purchase read data user log load name information update someone address delete user upon request
A huge amount code managing CRUD operation
Other language Perl PHP let exact thing Java run originally designed scripting quick evaluation program
They quite muscle
It matter say one thing powerful another invite fight someone show digital doorway say Actually night ruined
But I came said I need build platform month one going fire choosing Java
If I said I need prototype new platform next two month client may may decide build one look beautiful Web browser I might use something little smaller quite enterprisey
Python would good bet
Ruby would also fine
I really really like Clojure
It taught ton
But applies Clojure applies language
Oracle none pleased Google
The runtime something like JavaScript little like kernel operating system
It set service run JavaScript run available JavaScript code
You start runtime rest code run within context provides
In case context Web Ajax short Asynchronous JavaScript It refers set technology combined turned Web page software
After Ajax became much Web transformed publishing platform platform result Internet industry transformed current form
People complain
Application Programming big hairy set class object
There also Web APIs big hairy set class object retrieve using Web
A language way perceiving world
A standard library way organizing world
And IDE way bringing thing together lively dynamic way
In way Microsoft make tool available called Visual Studio us write software
You know else good sort thing
Microsoft developer developer developer developer
For lo New York AT T New Jersey begat Bell Labs begat Unix
And good
And Rochester later Stamford Xerox begat PARC Palo Alto begat Smalltalk
And good
And Cupertino Steve Jobs begat many men woman Macintosh
But Jobs cast Valley created NeXT married Unix Smalltalk Macintosh named issue NeXTStep NS stand NSThickSquareBezelStyle influence platform u always
I really like Django
It written kind people help people publishing
Ruby Rails probably famous Web framework course
It great
Comparison Web application framework solid Wikipedia page
In fact Wikipedia essential programming tool
The summary language approach typically full code sample
What name basically mean jerk
Torvalds told I egotistical bastard I name project
First Linux Actually programmer always talk much chat online often using Slack
Slack Internet startup provides chat service organized around need geographically diverse group
A large part appeal simplicity ease integrates product
Chat channel quickly come represent work going inside company set stream text searched
Slack provides institutional memory made lot nerd happy
It growing quickly
Slack investor recently valued billion time issue published probably worth planet earth

ACM Governance ACM encourages member take direct hand shaping future association
This philosophy permeates every level ACM reaching top echelon leadership member fill vital position council board committee govern organization raise visibility ACM worldwide
Commitment ethical professional conduct expected every member voting member associate member student member Association Computing Machinery ACM
This Code consisting imperative formulated statement personal responsibility identifies element commitment
It contains many issue professional likely face
outline fundamental ethical consideration address additional specific consideration professional conduct
Statements pertain specifically individual leadership role whether workplace volunteer capacity organization like ACM
Principles involving compliance Code given
The Code shall supplemented set Guidelines provide explanation assist member dealing various issue contained Code
It expected Guidelines changed frequently Code
The Code supplemented Guidelines intended serve basis ethical decision making conduct professional work
Secondarily may serve basis judging merit formal complaint pertaining violation professional ethical standard
It noted although computing mentioned imperative Code concerned fundamental imperative apply one conduct computing professional
These imperative expressed general form emphasize ethical principle apply computer ethic derived general ethical principle
It understood word phrase code ethic subject varying interpretation ethical principle may conflict ethical principle specific situation
Questions related ethical conflict best answered thoughtful consideration fundamental principle rather reliance detailed regulation
This principle concerning quality life people affirms obligation protect fundamental human right respect diversity culture
An essential aim computing professional minimize negative consequence computing system including threat health safety
When designing implementing system computing professional must attempt ensure product effort used socially responsible way meet social need avoid harmful effect health welfare
In addition safe social environment human includes safe natural environment
Therefore computing professional design develop system must alert make others aware potential damage local global environment
Harm mean injury negative consequence undesirable loss information loss property property damage unwanted environmental impact
This principle prohibits use computing technology way result harm following user general public employee employer
Harmful action include intentional destruction modification file program leading serious loss resource unnecessary expenditure human resource time effort required purge system computer virus
action including accomplish assigned duty may lead harm unexpectedly
In event responsible person person obligated undo mitigate negative consequence much possible
One way avoid unintentional harm carefully consider potential impact affected decision made design implementation
To minimize possibility indirectly harming others computing professional must minimize malfunction following generally accepted standard system design testing
Furthermore often necessary ass social consequence system project likelihood serious harm others
If system feature misrepresented user coworkers supervisor individual computing professional responsible resulting injury
In work environment computing professional additional obligation report sign system danger might result serious personal social damage
If one superior act curtail mitigate danger may necessary blow whistle help correct problem reduce risk
However capricious misguided reporting violation harmful
Before reporting violation relevant aspect incident must thoroughly assessed
In particular assessment risk responsibility must credible
It suggested advice sought computing professional
See regarding thorough evaluation
Honesty essential component trust
Without trust organization function effectively
The honest computing professional make deliberately false deceptive claim system system design instead provide full disclosure pertinent system limitation problem
A computer professional duty honest qualification circumstance might lead conflict interest
Membership volunteer organization ACM may time place individual situation statement action could interpreted carrying weight larger group professional
An ACM member exercise care misrepresent ACM position policy ACM ACM unit
The value equality tolerance respect others principle equal justice govern imperative
Discrimination basis race sex religion age disability national origin factor explicit violation ACM policy tolerated
Inequities different group people may result use misuse information technology
In fair society individual would equal opportunity participate benefit use computer resource regardless race sex religion age disability national origin similar factor
However ideal justify unauthorized use computer resource provide adequate basis violation ethical imperative code
Violation copyright patent trade secret term license agreement prohibited law circumstance
Even software protected violation contrary professional behavior
Copies software made proper authorization
Unauthorized duplication material must condoned
Computing professional obligated protect integrity intellectual property
Specifically one must take credit idea work even case work explicitly protected copyright patent etc
Computing communication technology enables collection exchange personal information scale unprecedented history civilization
Thus increased potential violating privacy individual group
It responsibility professional maintain privacy integrity data describing individual
This includes taking precaution ensure accuracy data well protecting unauthorized access accidental disclosure inappropriate individual
Furthermore procedure must established allow individual review record correct inaccuracy
This imperative implies necessary amount personal information collected system retention disposal period information clearly defined enforced personal information gathered specific purpose used purpose without consent individual
These principle apply electronic communication including electronic mail prohibit procedure capture monitor electronic user data including message without permission user bona fide authorization related system operation maintenance
User data observed normal duty system operation maintenance must treated strictest confidentiality except case evidence violation law organizational regulation Code
In case nature content information must disclosed proper authority
The principle honesty extends issue confidentiality information whenever one made explicit promise honor confidentiality implicitly private information directly related performance one duty becomes available
The ethical concern respect obligation confidentiality employer client user unless discharged obligation requirement law principle Code
Excellence perhaps important obligation professional
The computing professional must strive achieve quality cognizant serious negative consequence may result poor quality system
Excellence depends individual take responsibility acquiring maintaining professional competence
A professional must participate setting standard appropriate level competence strive achieve standard
Upgrading technical knowledge competence achieved several way independent study attending seminar conference course involved professional organization
ACM member must obey existing local state province national international law unless compelling ethical basis
Policies procedure organization one participates must also obeyed
But compliance must balanced recognition sometimes existing law rule may immoral inappropriate therefore must challenged
Violation law regulation may ethical law rule inadequate moral basis conflict another law judged important
If one decides violate law rule viewed unethical reason one must fully accept responsibility one action consequence
Quality professional work especially computing profession depends professional reviewing critiquing
Whenever appropriate individual member seek utilize peer review well provide critical review work others
Computer professional must strive perceptive thorough objective evaluating recommending presenting system description alternative
Computer professional position special trust therefore special responsibility provide objective credible evaluation employer client user public
When providing evaluation professional must also identify relevant conflict interest stated
As noted discussion avoiding harm sign danger system must reported opportunity responsibility resolve
See guideline detail concerning harm including reporting professional violation
Honoring one commitment matter integrity honesty
For computer professional includes ensuring system element perform intended
Also one contract work another party one obligation keep party properly informed progress toward completing work
A computing professional responsibility request change assignment feel completed defined
Only serious consideration full disclosure risk concern employer client one accept assignment
The major underlying principle obligation accept personal accountability professional work
On occasion ethical principle may take greater priority
A judgment specific assignment performed may accepted
Having clearly identified one concern reason judgment failing procure change assignment one may yet obligated contract law proceed directed
The computing professional ethical judgment final guide deciding whether proceed
Regardless decision one must accept responsibility consequence
However performing assignment one judgment relieve professional responsibility negative consequence
Computing professional responsibility share technical knowledge public encouraging understanding computing including impact computer system limitation
This imperative implies obligation counter false view related computing
Theft destruction tangible electronic property prohibited Avoid harm others
Trespassing unauthorized use computer communication system addressed imperative
Trespassing includes accessing communication network computer system account file associated system without explicit authorization
Individuals organization right restrict access system long violate discrimination principle
No one enter use another computer system software data file without permission
One must always appropriate approval using system resource including communication port file space system peripheral computer time
This section draw extensively draft IFIP Code Ethics especially section organizational ethic international concern
The ethical obligation organization tend neglected code professional conduct perhaps code written perspective individual member
This dilemma addressed stating imperative perspective organizational leader
In context leader viewed organizational member leadership educational responsibility
These imperative generally may apply organization well leader
In context organization corporation government agency employer well volunteer professional organization
Because organization kind impact public must accept responsibility society
Organizational procedure attitude oriented toward quality welfare society reduce harm member public thereby serving public interest fulfilling social responsibility
Therefore organizational leader must encourage full participation meeting social responsibility well quality performance
Organizational leader responsible ensuring computer system enhance degrade quality working life
When implementing computer system organization must consider personal professional development physical safety human dignity worker
Appropriate ergonomic standard considered system design workplace
Because computer system become tool harm well benefit organization leadership responsibility clearly define appropriate inappropriate us organizational computing resource
While number scope rule minimal fully enforced established
Current system user potential user person whose life may affected system must need assessed incorporated statement requirement
System validation ensure compliance requirement
Designing implementing system deliberately inadvertently demean individual group ethically unacceptable
Computer professional decision making position verify system designed implemented protect personal privacy enhance personal dignity
This complement imperative public understanding
Educational opportunity essential facilitate optimal participation organizational member
Opportunities must available member help improve knowledge skill computing including course familiarize consequence limitation particular type particular professional must made aware danger building system around oversimplified model improbability anticipating designing every possible operating condition issue related complexity profession
The future computing profession depends technical ethical excellence
Not important ACM computing professional adhere principle expressed Code member encourage support adherence member
Adherence professional code ethic largely voluntary matter
However member follow code engaging gross misconduct membership ACM may terminated

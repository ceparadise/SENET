We definitely teaching computer science CS elementary school
Why
The common answer question job necessarily traditional computing programming job
Our nation current trajectory point lasting digital era need people think like software engineer network architect whether writing app solving resource distribution problem setting time
But let forget job moment
After really know economy year talking
The rationale teach CS student go well beyond career development
For kid entering school teaching CS giving thinking skill help become proactive learner citizen opposed consumer denizen world increasingly influenced manipulation digital bit
CS student new
Computing elementary school kid saw heyday Seymour Papert movement took education storm
But recent year enjoying comeback
version popular programming environment released iPad summer platform way
CS featured prominently new education offering
And team launched three course well nationwide network affiliate offer free workshop give every teacher classroom material
But decide whether teaching CS young student worth need understand computer science elementary grade really look like
It learning use keyboard mouse except purpose moving instruction block around form algorithm
And advocating safe digital literacy practice like visiting certain approved website unless website happens coding environment community student share work
The important part CS experience ability encourage support creative expression problem solving
As Seymour Papert said year ago CS giving kid opportunity engage powerful idea
The computer happens era best accessible tool purpose
Coding puzzle tutorial progression unplugged activity learning computing concept without computer onramps world student passionate powerful enough express imagination
Creativity collaboration persistence abstraction thinking skill coding build
Shouldn
Can figure creative clever way make room school schedule something important digital age student
Shouldn kid learn manipulate bit digitize problem add computing process toolbox
And important enough start teaching young age
If agree answer question yes stopping u
Many fear reading writing math instruction score suffer add one thing curriculum
But CS another subject
It serve glue interdisciplinary study mean time spend added integrated
And testing At moment influx hardware way elementary school prepare u Common Core testing
Shouldn take advantage opportunity show young student computer toy testing tool powerful mean expression enables driver creation
As PD provider know kid hesitant try something new
It u adult
We need make sure teacher administrator opportunity participate computer science professional learning build enthusiasm important subject learn integrate classroom relevant meaningful way
Just want kid learn count math class want give young student thorough background field revolutionizing every aspect world
We owe
I agree learning use many productivity editing collaborating communicating coding tool would valuable across curriculum
But early elementary student primary need literacy numeracy
For middle elementary introduction skill particularly coding engineering application age appropriate anything introductory instruction go beyond limit time
By middle school student teacher focused research collaboration writing skill allow complete core class homework
Funding another consideration
Some district particularly large one budget implement program would allow classroom teacher integrate computer skill core curriculum
But school face definite funding limitation many school small rural district also often deal added challenge spotty internet connectivity
Finding time school day enough device student continue major obstacle u many district
Finally achieving university demand deliver student writing comprehension communication mathematics skill already tall order
Throwing yet another demand mix would unrealistic many school student
Yes I read article unprepared student enter college manage demand digital age workplace
But I think make sense leave skill engineering higher mathematics global communication high school higher education
Elementary school place master basic including literacy language technology numeracy
I saying elementary student capable using even mastering code
But I believe really teaching introducing coding simply beyond scope school student able even asking lot middle school lab time class time limited
What pushing student study abstract concept developmentally ready make prepared rest century
Computer science necessary part whole educational package
However part important
All often tendency treat computer technology subject instead valuable powerful tool teach skill appropriate grade level

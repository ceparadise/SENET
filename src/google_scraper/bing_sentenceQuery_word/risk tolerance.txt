Risk part life
While may significant risk day encounter least every day
For example let say alarm go late work
You may run stair hurry door
Running stair pose risk falling
Risk everywhere adult usually best minimize serious risk sometimes always possible business standpoint
In lesson learn willingness one endure variability volatility investment impact business
Let start clear definition risk tolerance
essentially much risk one willing take investment concerned
With type investment always risk much risk one able withstand risk tolerance
For example low risk tolerance may sell stock first time start dip
Or like live risker side thing may ride volatile time see much money make
From business standpoint many time make investment perhaps stock bond even another company provides service
Each time invest essentially making decision handle company financial asset
Because business know certain thing turn taking risk
Some factor fluctuate risk business investment include thing like market decision corporation make like merging another company even political decision investment range internationally
So company manage risk
What role ensuring future company protecting stakeholder
Well know correlation stake risk return
This mean bigger risk bigger reward form money
While stakeholder want company succeed best also want company make risky investment end collapsing business
This strategic management come
managing company resource reach goal meet objective effectively handling threat company
Strategic management mean understanding competition developing strategy effectively compete competition
Like mentioned earlier part strategic management identifying handling threat bigger threat losing money
Because investment risky often result losing money
That managing threat mean understanding risk tolerance company making sure risk great jeopardize stability
Obviously even best strategic management plan fully eliminate risk stakeholder point view finding way minimize risk protects investment company also protects company whole
But company minimize risk company
Perhaps best answer question investing variety asset
If company make investment different asset create buffer say
Basically thought putting egg one basket
By investing different thing like stock bond even real estate chance one investment may well others might thus still providing opportunity increase reward lowering risk

Tony Tech World fast growing company make tech gadget
Over course five year expanded across different state employ thousand people
Lately company considered expanding internationally
They feel product used place outside United States
While management feel taking company internationally pay greatly stakeholder feel otherwise
You see research shown area looking expand really purchase tech gadget
This mean huge risk investing building employee need start new location
If customer area decide purchase tech gadget location fail Tony Tech World lose significant amount money
If however location succeeds huge return investment
Because anyone interest company many consider taking risk
For example supplier may able get part new location lender may feel uncomfortable investing international location government may change policy directly affect company
In order make best decision Tony Tech World decides strategically look data say risk
After thorough investigation decide risk far great result could catastrophic stakeholder
They decide start new location within United States instead
How much risk one willing take investment knowns
act meeting goal objective managing resource identifying threat
An effective strategic management plan help protect investment interest company

Identify risk important enough manage
By All project risk
They may risk risk nonetheless
The purpose risk management identify risk important enough manage
You evaluate risk based two likelihood occurrence impact project
As project manager need decide risk important enough worry
Your answer say something risk tolerance
For example let say project cost take six month duration
Early project identify risk likely occur impact duration
You may choose ignore risk since impact small rather incur effort cost managing risk
In example number fairly trivial risk easy ignore
But ratchet impact little higher
Let say risk impact one week duration
What two week duration
Would manage either risk
Your answer provides sense level risk willing tolerate
When performing risk identification need determine tolerance level risk
This help focus risk important ignoring risk impact fall tolerance level
Risk tolerance unique project manager also cultural organization
Some organization generally accept riskier project
They also tend higher threshold chose manage risk specific project
This mean risk management
In fact might perform rigorous risk management
However project manager organization tend accept higher threshold risk probability risk impact put specific risk plan place manage risk
On hand organization tend accept le risky project tend lower threshold manage risk project
In word let say similar project organization
The project manager organization tend manage risk project manager organization might choose leave
What risk tolerance mean
First understand need manage every important one
You model help determine one important
This may way classify risk high medium manage high risk
It might mean manage every risk likelihood occurrence risk impact schedule budget
These example
You need come tolerance level project map identified risk
Those fall risk tolerance one ignore risk tolerance managed

program must address As recently year Massachusetts law regarding protection personal information put forth explicit requirement written information security program
Regulations best practice contain useful advice generally sound requirement rarely ever address issue ensuring information security program aligned company tolerance risk
Why topic absent regulation best practice advice
How many company actively discus manage information security
Understanding company risk tolerance related securing information mean information security department know degree company senior management requires information protected confidentially leak data integrity compromise
And using knowledge information security department put policy practice place support risk tolerance
Without understanding company may overspending protecting data much protecting asset level expected required business leader
The absence requirement regulation best practice may due extraordinary challenge discussing risk tolerance
To achieve security risk tolerance frank clear conversation company senior management degree information protected occur
The conversation must include discussion data protected even important data protected level
The conversation must lead conclusion example customer employee information low level six sigma level known exposure point six sigma level represents low tolerance information compromise fewer defect one million occurrence information tolerate higher potential exposure level one sigma close defect per one million occurrence
It degree understanding security professional technical engineer build system measurement satisfy company requirement risk tolerance
It important note simple one conversation suffice
This take many conversation ongoing discussion
It requires discipline common term language ability recognize calibrating risk tolerance understood business leader actualized technology leader ongoing process
Risk tolerance easy articulate static
Many company find risk tolerance change event occurs stated tolerance may high faced actual security event compromise data
The core effective information security program protecting reporting ability protect information commensurate within three main category regulatory guidance commercially reasonable best practice company risk tolerance data compromise
Programs become mature time related regulatory guidance best practice
However new maturity level need achieved securing information alignment company stated risk tolerance

potential gaining losing something value
Values emotional financial wealth gained lost taking risk resulting given action inaction foreseen unforeseen planned planned
Risk also defined intentional interaction
Uncertainty potential unpredictable uncontrollable outcome risk consequence action taken spite uncertainty
subjective judgment people make severity probability risk may vary person person
Any human endeavour carry risk much riskier others
The cite earliest use word English spelling French original spelling
It defines Exposure possibility loss injury adverse unwelcome circumstance chance situation involving possibility
The publication ISO Guide definition risk uncertainty objective
In definition uncertainty include event may may happen uncertainty caused ambiguity lack information
It also includes negative positive impact objective
Many definition risk exist common usage however definition developed international committee representing country based input several thousand subject matter expert
Very different approach risk management taken different field
Risk unwanted subset set uncertain outcome Cornelius Keating
Risk ubiquitous area life risk management something must whether managing major organisation simply crossing road
When describing risk however convenient consider risk practitioner operate specific practice area
Economic risk manifested lower income higher expenditure expected
The cause many instance hike price raw material lapsing deadline construction new operating facility disruption production process emergence serious competitor market loss key personnel change political regime natural disaster
Risks personal health may reduced action decrease early cause illness action person clearly measured clinical sign symptom recognised risk factor
Tertiary reduces negative impact already established disease restoring function reducing complication
Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion individual patient obtain secondary tertiary prevention effort whereas public health effort primary prevention require education entire population risk
In case careful communication risk factor likely outcome must distinguish causal event must decreased associated event may merely consequence rather cause
In epidemiology effect also called entire lifetime
In term occupational health safety management term may defined likely consequence hazard combined likelihood probability occurring
Health safety environment HSE separate practice area however often linked
The reason typically organizational management structure however strong link among discipline
One strongest link single risk event may impact three area albeit differing timescales
For example uncontrolled release radiation toxic chemical may immediate safety consequence protracted health impact much environmental impact
Events Chernobyl example caused immediate death longer term death cancer left lasting environmental impact leading birth defect impact wildlife etc
Over time form risk analysis called environmental risk analysis developed
Environmental risk analysis field study attempt understand event activity bring risk human health environment
Human health environmental risk likelihood adverse outcome See
As risk function hazard exposure
Hazard intrinsic danger harm posed
toxicity chemical compound
Exposure likely contact hazard
Therefore risk even hazardous substance approach zero exposure nears zero given person organism biological makeup activity location See
Another example health risk certain behaviour increase likelihood contracting HIV
Individual risk perception risk taking also influenced social factor
A study using representative household data US Italy Austria find evidence risk taking level influenced immediate social environment welfare regime state

Insurance risk treatment option involves risk sharing
It considered form contingent capital akin purchasing buyer pay small premium protected potential large loss
Insurance risk often taken insurance company bear pool risk including market risk credit risk operational risk interest rate risk mortality risk longevity risk etc
Means assessing risk vary widely profession
Indeed may define profession example doctor manages medical risk civil engineer manages risk structural failure
A professional usually focused risk assessment mitigation professional behalf client public society life general
In workplace incidental exist
Incidental risk occur naturally business part core business
Inherent risk negative effect operating profit business
The experience many people rely human service support often used reason prevent gaining independence fully accessing community service often unnecessarily risk averse
People autonomy used compromised institution wall often risk management practice according
Michael Fischer Ewan Ferlie find contradiction formal risk control role subjective factor human service role emotion ideology undermine service value producing tension even intractable conflict
A HRO organisation succeeded avoiding catastrophe environment expected due risk factor
Most study HROs involve area nuclear aircraft carrier air traffic control aerospace nuclear power station
Organizations share common ability consistently operate safely complex interconnected environment single failure one component could lead catastrophe
Essentially organisation appear operate spite enormous range risk
Some industry manage risk highly quantified enumerated way
These include possible failure complex series engineered system could result highly undesirable outcome
The usual measure risk class event probability event severity consequence
The total risk sum individual see
In nuclear industry consequence often measured term radiological release often banded five band
The risk evaluated using fault tree technique see
Where risk low normally considered broadly acceptable
A higher level risk typically time considered broadly acceptable justified cost reducing possible benefit make risk described Tolerable ALARP stand low reasonably practicable
Risks beyond level classified intolerable
The level risk deemed broadly acceptable considered regulatory body various early attempt UK government regulator academic used example similar activity definable risk people appear find acceptable
This resulted Farmer Curve acceptable probability event versus consequence
The technique whole usually referred probabilistic risk assessment PRA probabilistic safety assessment PSA
See example approach
In finance risk chance return achieved investment different expected also take account size difference
This includes possibility losing original investment
In view advocated Damodaran risk includes also upside risk return exceed expectation
Some regard historical return average return specific investment providing historical measure risk see modern portfolio theory
Financial risk may determined numerous market factor operational resulting fraudulent behaviour

A fundamental idea finance relationship risk return see
The greater potential return one might seek greater risk one generally assumes
A free market reflects principle pricing instrument strong demand safer instrument drive price higher return correspondingly lower weak demand riskier instrument drive price lower potential return thereby higher
For example US Treasury bond considered one safest investment
In comparison investment speculative grade corporate bond US Treasury note bond yield lower rate return
The reason corporation likely default debt US government
Because risk investing corporate bond higher investor offered correspondingly higher rate return
A popular VaR
There different type VaR long term VaR marginal VaR factor VaR shock VaR
The latter used measuring risk extreme market stress condition
In finance single definition
Artzner et al
write call risk investor future net worth
In Novak risk possibility undesirable event
In financial market one may need measure information timing source risk probability model risk operational risk regulatory civil action taken result
With advent automation financial market concept risk gained lot attention
Aldridge Krawciw define risk probability instantaneous loss due flash crash market crisis malicious activity selected market participant event
A example risk US million loss incurred within minute Knight Capital Group KCG August culprit runaway algorithm deployed firm
Regulators taken notice risk well
Basel III requires risk management framework bank stability
It always obvious financial instrument specifically reduce cancel risk another investment speculation increasing measurable risk exposing investor catastrophic loss pursuit high windfall increase expected value

Note As defined audit risk consider impact auditor misstatement stated simple probability
The impact misstatement must considered determining acceptable audit risk
Security risk management involves protection asset harm caused deliberate act
A detailed definition A security risk event could result compromise organizational asset
unauthorized use loss damage disclosure modification organizational asset profit personal interest political interest individual group entity constitutes compromise asset includes risk harm people
Compromise organizational asset may adversely affect enterprise business unit client
As consideration security risk vital component risk management
One growing area focus risk management field behavioural organizational psychology underpin understanding risk based decision making
This field considers question make risk based decision
irrationally scared shark terrorist motor vehicle medication
In regret anticipation regret play significant part distinct preferring status quo case one becomes worse
fundamental problem form risk assessment
In particular brain get overloaded take mental shortcut risk extreme event discounted probability low evaluate intuitively
As example one leading cause death caused partly given driver frame problem largely totally ignoring risk serious fatal accident
For instance extremely disturbing event attack hijacking may ignored analysis despite fact occurred nonzero probability
Or event everyone agrees inevitable may ruled analysis due greed unwillingness admit believed inevitable
These human tendency error often affect even rigorous application major concern
All must consider notational bias No group people assessing risk immune acceptance obviously wrong answer simply socially painful disagree
Framing involves information affect outcome risky decision
The right prefrontal cortex shown take global perspective greater left prefrontal activity relates local focal processing
From Theory Leaky Modules McElroy Seta proposed could predictably alter framing effect selective manipulation regional prefrontal activity finger tapping monaural listening
The result expected
Rightward tapping listening effect narrowing attention frame ignored
This practical way manipulating regional cortical activation affect risky decision especially directed tapping listening easily done
A growing area research examine various psychological aspect risk taking
Researchers typically run randomised experiment treatment control group ascertain effect different psychological factor may associated risk taking
Thus positive negative feedback past risk taking affect future risk taking
In experiment people led believe competent decision making saw opportunity risky choice took risk led believe competent saw threat took fewer risk
The concept maintenance advanced form
In case chemical industry apart probability failure consequence failure also important
Therefore selection maintenance policy based risk instead reliability
maintenance methodology act tool maintenance planning decision making reduce probability failure consequence
In maintenance decision making maintenance resource used optimally based risk class high medium low equipment machine achieve tolerable risk criterion
Closely related information assurance security risk cybersecurity application system security engineering order address compromise company required business mission purpose
In order address cybersecurity applies security supply chain design production environment product service product order provide efficient appropriate security commensurate value asset mission business process
Since risk assessment management essential security management tightly related
Security assessment methodology like contain risk assessment module important part first step methodology
On hand risk assessment methodology like evolved become security assessment methodology
An standard risk management Principles guideline implementation published code November
There many formal method used measure risk
Often probability negative event estimated using frequency past similar event
Probabilities rare failure may difficult estimate
This make risk assessment difficult hazardous industry example nuclear energy frequency failure rare harmful consequence failure severe
Statistical method may also require use turn may require calculation cost loss human life
This difficult problem
One approach ask people willing pay insure death radiological release
GBq answer depend strongly circumstance clear approach effective
Risk often measured undesirable outcome
This combine probability various possible event assessment corresponding harm single value

According one set definition fear fleeting emotion ascribed particular object trait fear referring trait anxiety distinct term anxiety generally used last longer attributed specific stimulus particular definition used author cited page
Some study show link anxious behaviour risk chance outcome unfavorable result
Joseph Forgas introduced based research emotion grouped either positive negative Lerner Keltner
Positive emotion happiness believed optimistic risk assessment negative emotion anger pessimistic risk assessment
As emotion negative valence fear therefore anxiety long associated negative risk perception
Under recent appraisal tendency framework Jennifer Lerner et refutes Forgas notion valence promotes idea specific emotion distinctive influence judgment fear still related pessimistic expectation
Psychologists demonstrated increase anxiety increase related people habituated anxiety experience awareness risk intensely normal individual
In anxiety promotes use bias quick thinking evaluate risk
This referred according Clore
However accuracy risk perception making choice known
Experimental study show brief surge anxiety correlated surge general risk perception
Anxiety exists presence threat perceived Maner Schmidt
As risk perception increase stay related particular source impacting mood change opposed spreading unrelated risk factor
This increased awareness threat significantly emphasised people conditioned anxiety
For example anxious individual predisposed generating reason negative result tend exhibit pessimism
Also finding suggest perception lack control lower inclination participate risky across various behavioural circumstance associated individual experiencing relatively high level trait anxiety
In previous instance supporting clinical research link emotional evaluation control anxiety felt option risk avoidance
There various view presented emotion cause people access involuntary response judgment making decision involve risk
Joshua Hemmerich et al
probe deeper anxiety impact choice exploring quick automatic natural reaction danger based emotion
This notion supported experiment engages physician simulated perilous surgical procedure
It demonstrated measurable amount participant anxiety patient outcome related previous experimentally created regret worry ultimately caused physician led feeling information guideline provided mock surgery
Additionally emotional level adjusted along simulated patient status suggest anxiety level respective decision made correlated type bad outcome experienced earlier part experiment
Similarly another view anxiety dispositional anxiety emotional state cognitive provide information future pitfall reward Maner Schmidt
When experiencing anxiety individual draw personal judgment referred pessimistic outcome appraisal
These emotion promote bias risk avoidance promote risk tolerance
It common people dread risk others They tend afraid epidemic disease nuclear power plant failure plane accident relatively unconcerned highly frequent deadly event traffic crash household accident medical error
One key distinction dreadful risk seems potential catastrophic consequence threatening kill large number people within short period time
For example immediately September attack many Americans afraid fly took car instead decision led significant increase number fatal crash time period following event compared time period attack
Different hypothesis proposed explain people fear dread risk
First psychometric paradigm suggests high lack control high catastrophic potential severe consequence account increased risk perception anxiety associated dread risk
Second people estimate frequency risk recalling instance occurrence social circle medium may overvalue relatively rare dramatic risk overpresence undervalue frequent le dramatic risk
Third according preparedness hypothesis people prone fear event particularly threatening survival human evolutionary history
Given human evolutionary history people lived relatively small group rarely exceeding people dread risk kill many people could potentially wipe one whole group
Indeed research found people fear peak risk killing around people increase larger group killed
Fourth fearing dread risk ecologically rational strategy
Besides killing large number people single point time dread risk reduce number child young adult would potentially produced offspring
Accordingly people concerned risk killing younger hence fertile group
The relationship higher level risk perception judgmental accuracy anxious individual remains unclear Joseph Constans
There chance judgmental accuracy correlated heightened anxiety
Constans conducted study examine worry propensity current mood trait anxiety might influence college student estimation performance upcoming exam study found worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias error risk assessment even variance attributable current mood trait anxiety removed
Another experiment suggests trait anxiety associated pessimistic risk appraisal heightened perception probability degree suffering associated negative experience controlling depression
In seminal work established distinction risk uncertainty

Uncertainty must taken sense radically distinct familiar notion Risk never properly separated
The term risk loosely used everyday speech economic discussion really cover two thing functionally least causal relation phenomenon economic organization categorically different

The essential fact risk mean case quantity susceptible measurement time something distinctly character crucial difference bearing phenomenon depending two really present operating

It appear measurable uncertainty risk proper shall use term far different unmeasurable one effect uncertainty
We accordingly restrict term uncertainty case type
Thus immeasurable possible calculate Knightian sense risk measurable
Another distinction risk uncertainty proposed Douglas Hubbard In sense one may uncertainty without risk risk without uncertainty
We uncertain winner contest unless personal stake risk
If bet money outcome contest risk
In case one outcome
The measure uncertainty refers probability assigned outcome measure risk requires probability outcome loss quantified outcome
The term often used similarly describe organisation individual attitude towards
One attitude may described
Risk tolerance look deviation expected
Risk appetite look much risk one willing accept
There still deviation within risk appetite
For example recent research find insured individual significantly likely divest risky asset holding response decline health controlling variable income age medical expense
Gambling investment wherein money hand risked possible large return possibility losing
Purchasing lottery ticket risky investment high chance return small chance high return
In contrast putting money bank defined rate interest action give guaranteed return small gain precludes investment possibly higher gain
The possibility getting return investment also known
Hubbard also argues defining risk product impact probability presumes unrealistically
A person utility proportional payoff
For example person would consider chance winning million exactly desirable getting certain
However actually would consider equivalent choice
This gave rise
Hubbard proposes instead describe risk quantity distinguishes probability magnitude risk
Risks simply described set function possible payoff gain loss associated probability
This array collapsed scalar value according

When come investing risk reward go hand hand
The phrase pain gain come close summing relationship risk reward
Don let anyone tell otherwise investment involve degree risk
If plan buy security important understand could lose money invest
The reward taking risk potential greater investment return
If financial goal long time horizon may make money carefully investing higher risk asset stock bond limit le risky asset
On hand lower risk cash investment may appropriate financial goal
An aggressive investor one high risk tolerance willing risk losing money get potentially better result
A conservative investor one low risk tolerance favor investment maintain original investment
Many investment website offer free online questionnaire help ass risk tolerance
Some website even estimate asset allocation based response questionnaire
While suggested asset allocation may useful starting point keep mind result may biased towards financial product service sold company individual sponsoring website

A deep understanding security propensity allows individual institutional investor purchase highly volatile instrument small company stock plummet zero option contract expire worthless
While maintaining base riskless security aggressive investor reach maximum return maximum risk
For example favorite hedge fund bet SunEdison solar power provider estimated worth per share Greenlight Capital David Einhorn took million stake company
The stock exposed duplicitous accounting practice sits cent per share July
Moderate investor accept risk principal adopt balanced approach intermediate term time horizon five year
Combining mutual fund le volatile bond riskless security moderate investor often pursue structure
A typical strategy might involve investing half portfolio growth fund Equity Index fund hold average risk returned annually average year ending July
Conservative investor willing accept little volatility investment portfolio
Often retiree spent decade building nest egg unwilling allow type risk principal

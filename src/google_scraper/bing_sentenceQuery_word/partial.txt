Partial order theory widely employed computer science particularly logic formal method programming language static analysis
But partial order theory intertwined field like topology zoo definition concept attached area
Not commonly used computer science
In article I summarized fragment partial order theory commonly used computer science particular home fragment static analysis
Topics covered include preorders equivalence relation total order partial order semilattices lattice bounded lattice complete lattice monotonicity fixed point Kleene fixed point theorem
At end find natural liftings partial order lattice across power set Cartesian product sequence function space
Where applicable formal definition transliterated Haskell
If interested partial order theory static analysis check appendix It comprehensive
The header Haskell code file And ghc extension used A binary relation set X iff relation reflexive transitive
A binary relation R x R x x
A binary relation R R b b R c implies R c
An preorder also symmetric
A binary relation R R b implies b R
An equivalence relation divide set S equivalence class
The element x x The set equivalence class X relation set
Every preorder induces natural equivalence relation A preorder antisymmetric
A set X equipped partial order often described pair X
A binary relation R R b b R implies b
In Haskell define partial order type class A binary relation total transitive antisymmetric
A binary relation R two value b R b b R
Totality implies reflexivity mean every total order also partial order
A poset two element b greatest lower bound denoted b
The greatest lower bound b largest element still le
In lattice greatest lower bound must unique
The greatest lower bound b also called b
The following property A poset two element b least upper bound denoted b
The least upper bound b smallest element still greater
In lattice least upper bound must unique
The least upper bound b also called b
The following property If poset meet semilattice join semilattice poset also
In Haskell lattice partial order meet join defined A lattice L exists maximum element top minimum element bottom set L
For element x lattice must case In Haskell type class bounded lattice defines top bottom A lattice L every possibly infinite subset S L least upper bound sup S greatest lower bound inf S
Every complete lattice L bounded lattice Given posets X Y function f X Y x x implies f x f x
To define continuous function first need define function application across set
Given function f X Y S X f x x S
Alternately f f
In text function application notationally distinguished ordinary function application
Given lattice X Y function f X Y S X implies f sup S sup
function also monotonic
Given function f X X x f x f x
With respect monotonic function f X X complete lattice X divide set X region It useful distinguish least greatest fixed point The following property hold region I recommend proving property short exercise
Given monotonic function f L L lattice L starting point x L set K x The notation mean iterated function composition If x Asc f ascending order chain K x since x x x Asc f
In Haskell infinite list represents Kleene chain starting bottom On lattice Kleene fixed point theorem say Moreover lattice finite height exists natural n lfp f
This fact lead simple algorithm computing fixed point
The function look first element sequence repeat neighbor So least fixed point function look stable point Kleene sequence There several natural liftings posets lattice across foundational discrete data structure flat set power set Cartesian product sum sequence function
Given set S pointed poset contains bottom And pointed poset contains top If S poset order extended pointing lattice In Haskell Given set S lift S L x iff In Haskell Given collection posets naturally lift partial order poset If posets lattice resulting poset lattice default
To make lattice must pointed
Given lattice natural Cartesian product lattice In Haskell Given poset L natural sequence poset As sum sequence must pointed become lattice
That sequence greater lesser sequence sequence different length always incomparable
In Haskell Given set S subset S form lattice inclusion P S
Given partial order X define preordered set P X Why partial order
Consider set natural number natural total order
Under regime yet violates antisymmetry
Of course possible lift preorder partial order equivalence class
Alternatively set canonicalized equivalence class represented single distinguished member
If preorder also partial order possible lift partial order equivalence class preorder
Given preordered set X natural partial order equivalence class poset b iff b b Given lattice Y set X natural lattice lattice X Y In Haskell This post scratch surface order theory leaf even application computer science
The two biggest omission reserved future post ordinal Scott domain theory
The ordinal extend natural number transfinite arithmetic provide powerful structure
That structure powerful mechanism reasoning program termination
Scott domain theory give meaningful interpretation infinitely recursive domain equation arise denotational semantics
If like learn Haskell I recommend And using Haskell I recommend

In Section Transaction Histories A H set transaction consists two part event E reflects operation read write abort commit transaction version order committed object version
The author give comment partial order event Page For convenience present history event example consistent partial order
Furthermore wherever possible example make total order consistent event database system
Why present partial order event total order
Because partial order may imply multiple total order consistent one choose
Does choice matter later definition theorem
Some comment total version order Page follows The version order history H different order write commit event H
This flexibility needed allow certain optimistic implementation possible version placed version version order even though installed committed state installed
And The system chooses version order object
What mean database system choose version order
And
Is
concern Question theoretical result state partial order S extended total order S contains S
This result known Order Extension Principle proof result us Axiom Choice I aware whether alternative proof use
The paper written French find proof
When Adya state chooses order event best guess assumes implementation database case every history H corresponds execution database event totally ordered order order
More specifically requiring partial order history H extended total order Adya imposes whenever H instant time event take place execution database lead H le instant time take place
Choosing order event extend partial order history H needed one want prove correctness abstract specification
set property history satisfy respect given specification
Let turn Question case seems Adya want stress fact allows implementation database access version object precedes version order latest version installed
In practice choosing earlier version object could either result database able access version
lost update anomaly causal consistency user explicitly requesting access older version object
accessing older version revision SVN repository
Hope help Andrea Cerone

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In book Martin Davis writes chapter two A partial function said partially computable computed program
also A function said computable partially computable total
From first definition partially computable function must second definition computable function must partially computable total contradiction function partially computable partial partial function total time
The definition exclude possibility function total
On contrary every total function fortiori partial function
Perhaps terminology unfortunate
A D R subset f D R D exists unique r R denoted f r f
The f dom f D
A D R R function f D R
When f say f
The f dom f D f
If dom f D f
For every partial function f dom f total function
As see partial function function undefined input total function partial function happens defined everywhere
Now regarding computability
Every program computes partial function f N N program halt input x f undefined x word f x
A computable function one computed algorithm always halt

Integral differential calculus set mental tool use solve problem world
It easy dismiss irrelevant learning problem book entirely divorced reality plenty application
Reasoning algorithm performance say primary purpose computer science find way use unexpected way job
You know saying hammer everything look like nail
It true enough good luck hammering bolt
The integral differential calculus set good wrench applicable every job absolutely necessary one designed
I totally agree example I make presentation example integral calculus used computer engineering could I talk
The time I recall seeing used CS undergrad algorithm course
We used approximation series hard work approximation probability
Those us expected course since integral continuous version series easy find event whose probability nasty
The sort probability approximation used applied probability class numerous place
If look CLRS Algorithm Design textbook algorithm data structure I sure see I talking
Especially look section approximation algorithm problem performance different hash scheme
All could put heading us theoretical CS
It probably least useful compared discrete mathematics algebra logic field
But many application integral calculus especially computer graphic lighting raytracing physic engine basically force represenatations based calculus also computer vision
notation try describe function scale compared input size grows use lot stuff found calculus like comparing function using limit derivative etc
Some advanced method use integral calculus example
Integral calculus also often used probabilistic algorithm analysis le often approximation algorithm
In used analyze asymptotic behavior mathematical appear analysis substantially different size
It generalization assumes equal size
It depends sort work
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
For application science certain type engineering used daily basis
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
One example I think top head calculating total cost carrying inventory
Let say estimated cost per unit per day essentially use integral determine total cost inventory period time
But right business application require explicit use calculus
I sure accurate I always viewed calculus necessary order force certain level mathematical maturity
If handle handle discrete math linear algebra IMO relevant
It foundation I guess
Summations crop algorithm analysis I ca remember using integral solve CS problem
Fouier series transform laplace transform use integral basis signal processing analysis heat transfer
The precise value math constant computer language provide summing large range
Pi e An integral curve give area bound respect ax
And many application lazy Knowing turn function polynomial function computer compute
Continuous time Markov chain important application improving performance analysis computer network devising better routing algorithm
Integral calculus used calculate probability density function continuous random variable Markov chain

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

Over beyond act company identifier advertiser software company
Because company program represent company product much attention given design done frequently commercial artist
To regulate use brand icon registered considered part company intellectual property
In order display number icon representing growing complexity offered device different system come different solution screen space management
The computer monitor continues display primary icon main page desktop allowing easy quick access commonly used function user
This screen space also invite almost immediate user customization user add favorite icon screen group related icon together screen
Secondary icon system program also displayed system
These secondary icon provide link like primary icon instead used show availability tool file system
Spatial management technique play bigger role mobile device much smaller screen real estate
In response mobile device introduced among visual device scrolling screen display selectable tab displaying group related icon
Even evolving display system icon remain relatively constant appearance function
Above icon must remain clearly identifiable display screen regardless position size
Programs might display icon desktop hyperlink also program title bar Start menu Microsoft tray Apple dock
In location primary purpose identify advertise program functionality available
This need recognition turn set specific design restriction effective computer icon
In order maintain consistency look device OS manufacturer offer detailed guideline development use icon system
This true standard system icon third party application icon included system
The system icon currently use typically gone widespread international acceptance understandability testing
Icon design factor also topic extensive usability study
The design involves high level skill combining attractive graphic design required usability feature
The icon need clear easily recognizable able display monitor widely varying size resolution
Its shape simple clean line without much detailing design
Together design detail shape also need make unique display clearly distinguishable icon
The icon need colorful enough easily pick display screen contrast well background
With increasing ability customize desktop important icon display standard color modified retaining characteristic appearance immediate recognition user
Through color also provide visual indicator icon state activated available currently accessible greyed
The standard icon generally size adult thumb enabling easy visual recognition use device
For individual device display size correlate directly size screen real estate resolution display
Because used multiple location screen design must remain recognizable smallest size use directory tree title bar retaining attractive shape larger size
In addition scaling may necessary remove visual detail simplify subject discrete size
Larger icon serve also part accessibility feature visually impaired many computer system
The width height icon almost area traditional use
Icons also augmented iconographic motion geometric manipulation applied graphical element time example scale rotation deformation
One example application icon wobble iOS convey user able repositioned dragged
This different icon animated graphic
In contrast static icon icon animated graphic kinetic behavior alter visual content element whereas fade blur tint addition new graphic badge exclusively alter icon pixel
Stated differently pixel icon moved rotated stretched altered added
Research shown iconographic motion act powerful reliable visual cue critical property icon embody
In primary function symbolic image icon design ideally divorced single language
For product targeting international marketplace primary design consideration icon localizing text icon costly

They also displayed text either link friendly name whereas icon defined primarily
Because design requirement icon creation costly process
There plethora icon creation tool found Internet ranging professional level tool utility bundled software development program freeware
Given wide availability icon tool icon set problem arise custom icon mismatched style icon included system
Icons underwent change appearance early used photorealistic appearance featuring effect softening sharpening edge enhancement glossy appearance drop shadow rendered
Icon editor used early platform usually contain rudimentary capable modifying image icon pixel pixel using simple drawing tool applying simple image filter
Professional icon designer seldom modify icon inside icon editor use advanced drawing modeling application instead
The main function performed icon editor generation icon image
An icon editor resamples source image resolution color depth required icon
Other function performed icon editor icon extraction executable file exe dll creation icon library saving individual image icon
All icon editor make icon system file folder text file etc
web page
These file extension
Windows web page
Macintosh
If editor also make cursor image saved file extension

Windows Macintosh
Using new icon simply matter moving image correct file folder using system tool select icon
In Windows could go My Computer open Tools explorer window choose Folder Options File Types select file type click Advanced select icon associated file type
Developers also use icon editor make icon specific program file
Assignment icon newly created program usually done within used develop program
However one creating application simply add line program resource script compilation
Many icon editor copy unique icon program file editing
Only assign icon program file much difficult task
Simple icon editor converter also available online

IBM role birth computer science began awkward meeting two starkly different individual
One IBM Chief Executive Thomas Watson son farmer lumber dealer grew near remote Painted Post NY graduated high school
The Benjamin Wood professor Columbia University head university Bureau Collegiate Educational Research
Yet Watson granted Wood noon meeting New York Century Club one day Wood quickly perceived Watson respected quest knowledge might respond favorably request tabulating machine could replace laborious method grading testing program
Wood explained Watson IBM machine could used measure anything represented mathematics including business activity physic biology astronomy scientific discipline
For Watson came revelation
Working university IBM involvement computer science
In General Electric suggested IBM run customer executive training class explain IBM product could client
In response IBM created tabulating program
Watson Laboratory course listed Columbia University course catalog
In IBM began teaching Watson Laboratory Course Computing seen first computer course
It reached people
The course dispersed IBM education center worldwide
By IBM educational center conducting million teaching
Following dot com crash number student enrolling computer science program declined
However trend reversing according new data annual Computing Research Association CRA Taulbee Survey
Total enrollment among US computer science undergraduate increased percent third straight year increase indicating decline
The survey document trend student enrollment employment graduate aspect computer science United States Canada
Careful time Watson earlier arranged assistant interrupt meeting end one hour
Instead shooed away assistant two men talked Watson hooked
In end donated machine Wood asked eventually became Columbia trustee
Ultimately close relationship IBM university instrumental emergence new scientific discipline Columbia offering one first course computing
They helped catalyze teaching computer science say Henry Chesbrough executive director Program Open Innovation Haas School Business University California Berkeley
Other university also computer science
IBM worked Howard Aiken professor Harvard University design build first running programmable computer Harvard Mark I installed university
Aiken set computing lab Harvard established degree program
Maurice Wilkes director Computer Laboratory Cambridge University Britain also established computer degree program
Today computer science field study university around world
In United States alone nearly every undergraduate college offer major discipline university offer PhD program
IBM effort lot
Lightness English translation Patrick Creagh Hackers The relationship IBM Columbia developed gradually
In Watson helped set lab Columbia dedicated using tabulating machine astronomy
Later IBM set basic scientific research lab edge scientist could easily interact Columbia university
At time scientist discipline understood use computer
So IBM created Watson Laboratory Course Computing time thousand academic high school science math teacher took course
IBM researcher designed taught regular course Columbia training graduate student apply computing various scientific discipline including astronomy engineering physic
In addition becoming academic discipline computer science also began take root vocation
Every profession requires association Eastern Association Computing Machinery founded meeting Columbia computer enthusiast including Wallace first director IBM Columbia arranged use space handful IBM researcher
Because university course computing early day IBM set Manhattan Systems Research Institute train employee
It first program kind computer industry
The program included course computer engineering software programming designing system solve particular customer problem
The first computer science department American college came along early starting Purdue University
Frederick Brooks IBM executive love teaching one pioneer field
Brooks managed development mainframe operating system volunteer teacher Columbia IBM Systems Research Institute accepted job setting computer science department University North Carolina Chapel Hill
The popularity computer science academic major waxed waned year
Enrollments United States dropped significantly analyst predicted many computer science programming job would migrate India
But since financial crisis computer science popularity
The excitement day interdisciplinary program combining computer science biology medicine business
The discipline still young enough
Changes happening say Brooks remains professor UNC
IBM remains confluence computing academia
Since advocating new field interdisciplinary study blend computing business social service science
Read Icon Progress
The IBMers developed concept highly educated Watson impulse help build academic foundation industry future
The expertise technical skill willingness take risk overall dedication IBM employee led countless transformative innovation year

Is inverting matrix Complexity class P
From runtime I would say yes O inverted matrix contain entry size polynomially bounded input
Yes done polynomial time proof quite subtle
It simply O time Gaussian elimination involves multiplying adding number time perform arithmetic operation dependent large
For matrix intermediate value become extremely large Gaussian elimination necessarily run polynomial time
Fortunately algorithm run polynomial time
They require quite bit care design algorithm analysis algorithm prove running time polynomial done
For instance running time Bareiss algorithm something like O n actually complex take simplification
For lot detail see Dick Lipton blog entry
Finally word caution
The precise running time depends upon exactly field working
The discussion applies working rational number
On hand instance working finite field GF integer modulo naive Gaussian elimination run O time
If understand mean likely ignore last paragraph
There formula entry inverse matrix give entry ratio two determinant one minor original matrix entire original matrix
This help bound size entry inverse matrix careful given reasonable notion size note even start integer matrix inverse could contain rational entry
That said often matrix inverse studied point view algebraic complexity theory count basic operation regardless magnitude
In model one show complexity matrix inverse equivalent complexity matrix multiplication polylogarithmic term reduction perhaps also help bound size coefficient
Given efficient algorithm algebraic complexity theory model one wonder whether implies similarly efficient algorithm usual model although final entry polynomial size calculation involves larger one
This probably case even issue could perhaps avoided using Chinese remainder theorem

I would like know complexity multiplying matrix size scalar
In fact I directed graph V E represented incidence matrix M
I would like calculate transpose graph inverse direction edge
I think I multiply M I get transposed graph
Am I right
I think complexity
Thanks
In general matrix j n nm entry array
To multiply A scalar c multiply element c assuming multiplication done constant time take nm multiplication
That way go though A adjacency matrix directed graph
For peoblem A adjacency matrix digraph G n vertex A n matrix j j directed edge j vertex vertex j j otherwise
You correctly note reversed graph G adjacency matrix j transpose A j j since G edge vertex vertex G edge
To get transpose A swap j j entry A
There n swap needed since swap every element main diagonal corresponding entry main diagonal
Note multiplying A wo work since entry adjacency matrix must
Of course previously noted user transpose matrix simple multiplication scalar
Transposition operation
The cost matrix operation dependent way matrix actually represented algorithm
While obvious representation cost O nm O square matrix scalar multiplication transposition representation chosen depending algorithm used lower cost
The complexity multiplying matrix scalar usual way imply multiplying element hence cost O nm
However general cost depends way actually represent matrix conceivable use representation cost might constant matrix represented scalar multiplication together scalar factor
The computational cost also lower case sparse matrix representation allows iterating useful element
Without going detail matrix transposition also done constant time complexity O choose represent matrix pair composed appropriate memory structure element indexation function accessing given row column number
Then transposition achieved constant time simply changing indexation function
matter representation expression ambiguous

The method complexity theory useful deciding efficiently expend resource also helping u distinguish effectively decidable problem posse efficient decision method first place
In regard traditional distinguish class
solved practice efficient algorithm class
lack algorithm may thus regarded intrinsically difficult decide despite possibly decidable principle
The significance distinction readily appreciated considering additional example
A familiar example computational problem
deciding n PRIMES
This problem intensely studied mathematics long development digital computer
See history primality testing recent survey state art
After number preliminary result century problem PRIMES shown posse decision algorithm

This qualifies PRIMES feasibly decidable relative standard widely accepted complexity theory algorithmic analysis see
Two related problem used illustrate sort contrast difficulty complexity theorist seek analyze RELATIVE PRIMALITY Given natural number posse greatest common divisor


FACTORIZATION Given natural number exist
RELATIVE PRIMALITY solved applying Euclid greatest common divisor algorithm
input repeatedly compute remainder rem x rem rem return yes otherwise
It may shown number step sequence always le equal x
This mean order determine relatively prime suffices calculate number remainder proportional number digit decimal representation smaller two number
As may also accomplished efficient algorithm
long division may plausibly maintained capable pair number x
writing numerical representation binary decimal notation blackboard storing numeral memory digital computer current design either computer also able carry algorithm order decide whether relatively prime
This hallmark problem
one decided practice sense everyday concretely embodied computation
FACTORIZATION decision variant familiar problem finding given number
unique sequence prime exponent x
It difficult see existed efficient algorithm deciding FACTORIZATION would also exist efficient algorithm determining prime factorization
It also easy see function taking prime factorization effectively computable traditional sense computability theory
For instance computed
In simplest form trial division operates successively testing divisibility integer smaller keeping track divisor found thus far
As number division required procedure proportional might first seem particularly onerous task employ method factor number moderate size using paper pencil calculation say x
Note however conventionally denote natural number using binary decimal numeral
A consequence length expression typically supplied input numerical algorithm represent input x N proportional rather x b base notation system question
As consequence possible concretely inscribe positional numeral moderate length denote astronomically large number
For instance binary numeral digit denotes number larger estimated age universe second binary numeral digit denotes number larger estimated age universe Planck time
There thus natural number whose binary representation easily inscribe human mathematician foreseeable computing device carry trial division algorithm
This might seem particularly troubling algorithm indeed naive sense admits several obvious improvement
need test divisibility number x find initial factor need test prime finitely many stored lookup table
Nonetheless mathematician attempting find efficient method factorization several hundred year
The efficient factorization algorithm yet developed similar trial division algorithm requires number primitive step grows roughly proportion
size input opposed length binary representation
A consequence observation exist concretely inscribable number say order decimal digit following property currently unaware factorization ii highly unlikely could currently find even access whatever combination currently available computing equipment algorithm wish
Like problem introduced FACTORIZATION considerable practical importance perhaps famously security well known cryptographic protocol assume intractable general case see
But foregoing observation still entail fundamental limitation ability know number prime factorization
For might still hoped research yield efficient algorithm allow u determine prime factorization every number might take practical interest
A comparison Euclid algorithm trial division provides useful context describing property might expect algorithm posse
For note prior observation suggest ought measure size input x N numerical algorithm rather term length binary representation
If let df x denote quantity easy see efficiency Euclid algorithm given function grows proportionally fixed fact whereas efficiency trial division given function proportional fixed fact
The difference growth rate function illustrates contrast currently taken complexity theorist touchstone feasibility traditionally taken touchstone intractability
For instance could shown polynomial time factorization algorithm exists might seem reasonable conclude FACTORIZATION genuinely intractable problem
Although currently unknown whether case contemporary result provide circumstantial evidence FACTORIZATION indeed intractable see
Stronger evidence adduced intractability conjecture SAT TSP INTEGER PROGRAMMING similarly great many problem practical interest subject like logic graph theory linear algebra formal language theory game theory combinatorics
The technical development complexity theory aim make comparison computational difficulty precise show classification certain problem intractable admits rigorous mathematical analysis
As seen computational complexity theory problem considered proportion difficulty carrying efficient algorithm may decided

Examples sort notwithstanding often claimed Turing original characterization effective computability provides template general analysis could mean function computable mechanical device
For instance argue process Turing originally arrived definition Turing machine generalized yield abstract characterization mechanical computing device
Such characterization may turn understood describing property physical system would obey order concretely implementable
For instance requirement Turing machine may access modify tape cell currently scanned head may generalized allow modification machine state bounded distance one computational locus

Nonetheless several feature CET suggest regarded le well established Paramount amongst yet know whether P properly contained complexity class NP appear contain highly intractable problem
The following additional caveat also often issued respect claim class computational problem decide practice neatly aligns decidable polynomial time using conventional deterministic Turing machine
CET classifies function whose efficient algorithm time complexity c arbitrarily large scalar factor exponent

Note definition treat accepting rejecting computation asymmetrically
For x computation sequence starting x may still lead rejecting state long lead accepting state
On hand x computation x required lead rejecting state

But foregoing definition actually describe tree T possible computation sequence starting given configuration deterministic machine example depicted Figure
Given asymmetry noted generally case branch T x must surveyed order determine decision input
A potential computation tree T x Turing machine starting initial configuration x
Accepting state labeled rejecting state
Note although tree contains accepting computation sequence length maximum depth still count towards determination n depth T x

In order demonstrate Theorem thus suffices show problem X NP polynomial time reducible SAT
Supposing X NP must Turing machine N Q accepting polynomial time complexity p n
The proof Theorem proceeds showing input length construct propositional formula N x satisfiable accepts within p n step
Although SAT still problem particular system logic combinatorial nature BHP
In light Theorem opened door showing great many problem NP showing SAT may efficiently reduced
For instance problem TSP INTEGER PROGRAMMING introduced NP
Here example NP problem SAT Given propositional formula CNF
conjunction disjunctive clause containing exactly three negated unnegated propositional variable exist satisfying assignment
HAMILTONIAN PATH Given finite graph G V E contain Hamiltonian Path
path visit vertex exactly
INDEPENDENT SET Given graph G V E natural number k exist set vertex V cardinality two vertex connected edge
VERTEX COVER Given graph G V E natural number k exist set vertex V cardinality edge u v least one member
SET COVERING Given finite set finite family S subset natural number exist subfamily S S cardinality S
The problem SAT shown NP Cook original paper
The example cited taken list problem previously identified context shown NP
The reduction required show completeness problem typically require construction come known
constituent instance one problem used simulate constituent instance different problem
For instance order see SAT may reduced INDEPENDENT SET first observe CNF formula form
propositional variable
A formula form satisfiable case exists valuation satisfying least one literal
On hand suppose consider family graph partitioned n disjoint triangle manner depicted Figure
It easy see independent set size graph must contain exactly one vertex triangle
This turn suggests idea using graph form gadget representing clause CNF formula
The graph formula
A reduction SAT INDEPENDENT SET described follows Let CNF formula consisting clause depicted
We construct graph V E consisting node respectively labeled literal comprising th clause
Additionally contains edge connecting node triangle corresponding literal depicted Figure
Now define mapping instance SAT instance INDEPENDENT SET f n
As contains vertex hence O edge evident f x computed polynomial time
To see f reduction SAT INDEPENDENT SET first suppose valuation
Then must least one literal every clause
Picking node corresponding literal triangle thus yield independent set size
Conversely suppose V independent set size
By construction contains exactly one vertex
And since edge pair node labeled oppositely signed literal different triangle contain contradictory literal
A satisfying valuation constructed setting v node labeled appears v otherwise
Since transitive composing polynomial time reduction together provides another mean showing various problem NP
For instance completeness TSP originally demonstrated via series reduction Thus although problem listed seemingly unrelated sense concern different kind mathematical object
logical formula graph system linear equation etc
fact NP taken demonstrate computationally universal NP manner BHP
It also follows transitivity existence polynomial time algorithm even NP problem would entail existence polynomial time algorithm problem NP
The existence algorithm would thus run strongly counter expectation virtue extensive effort devoted finding efficient solution particular NP problem INTEGER PROGRAMMING TSP
Such problem thus standardly regarded constituting difficult problem NP
As long Open Question answered positive
P NP NP problem thus fit description effectively decidable problem intrinsically difficult sense described
As see however mean hardest problem studied complexity theorist
Nor complexity theory incapable making distinction difficulty problem lie inside P P NP presuming latter class
In contrast Turing machine model N acceptance rejection convention deterministic model computation T
In word deterministic machine either accept reject input necessary sufficient exist single halting computation x x
The output machine determined whether x accepting rejecting configuration
A consequence complexity class like P defined term model
language X P complement X df x x also P
If define class coC consist problem whose complement class C thus follows P coP
In contrast guarantee class NP defined term model closed complementation
For consider problem SAT belonging class
SAT
complement SAT consists set formula exist satisfying valuation
contradictory formula propositional logic
From follows SAT VALID
set valid propositional formula
As observation provides easy polynomial time reduction SAT VALID latter thus member coNP also complete class
Note however order show VALID requires show true respect valuation
As exist valuation formula containing n propositional variable mean evident membership arbitrary formula VALID decided polynomial time algorithm implemented Turing machine relative acceptance rejection convention describe
In fact following another fundamental unresolved question contemporary complexity theory Are class NP coNP distinct
It widely believed like Open Question Open Question affirmative answer
But observe NP problem could shown coNP would also follow NP coNP
This turn suggests problem known class NP coNP unlikely NP symmetric consideration also unlikely coNP
This class consists problem posse polynomial sized certificate demonstrating membership
It easy see NP coNP includes problem P
But class also contains problem currently known feasibly decidable
An important example FACTORIZATION defined
For one hand number divide serf certificate membership n FACTORIZATION
And hand order demonstrate membership n FACTORIZATION suffices exhibit prime factorization factor le
This follows prime factorization unique unlike falsifying valuation case VALIDITY primality individual factor verified polynomial time AKS algorithm
Hence FACTORIZATION NP coNP simultaneously
As computational problem practical importance considerable effort put finding efficient algorithm FACTORIZATION
If inability find efficient factorization algorithm indeed indicative problem P positive answer Open Question would entail natural mathematical problem feasibly decidable also NP
This turn suggests degree structure problem lying P NP presuming class may provide yet finer grained analysis intrinsic computational difficulty provided Thesis alone
If initial attempt find efficient algorithm solving problem known decidable unsuccessful common strategy attempt show NP
For assuming P NP follows thesis feasible algorithm solving exist
Nonetheless field make use discrete mathematics often give rise decidable problem thought considerably difficult NP one
For recall consequence Theorem class EXP NEXP
exponential time exponential time properly extend P
Hence problem complete class currently classified infeasible regardless Open Question resolved
Such problem include several decision problem logic considered well version problem considered section
A complexity class likely properly contained EXP still contains many apparently infeasible problem arise computational practice PSPACE
A prototypical example problem PSPACE formulated using notion QBF

true quantified boolean formula
We may define problem TQBF Given quantified boolean formula true

This result suggests close connection problem decided using unbounded time feasible amount memory space could solved able answer certain kind existential universal query single step using bounded number alternation two kind query
This observation used give alternative characterization several complexity class considered
Recall instance NP informally characterized set problem membership established providing certificate appropriate sort
SAT established exhibiting satisfying valuation
Similarly coNP similarly characterized set problem established existence certificate
VALID also established exhibiting satisfying valuation
On basis observation difficult prove following Call relation R x x R x P
A problem NP case exists polynomial decidable relation R x polynomial p x x p R x
A problem coNP case exists polynomial decidable relation R x polynomial p x x p R x
Proposition provides basis defining hierarchy complexity class
PH based logical representation computational problem
We first define alternative name class P
P
We define class problem form X x p R x R x n class problem form X x q S x S x n p n q n polynomial
set problem n n
Finally class PH defined k N
It follows immediately Proposition NP coNP
It also evident foregoing definition containment relation depicted Figure
It also difficult show PH PSPACE
These relationship similar obtain analogously defined Arithmetic Hierarchy studied computability theory see
But whereas shown standard diagonal argument arithmetic hierarchy collapse following also currently unresolved question fundamental importance Is PH proper hierarchy
case k k k
Is PH properly contained PSPACE
The Polynomial Hierarchy
To better understand Open Questions b also expected decided positively useful explore relationship PSPACE characterization PH term quantifier alternation
To end first show problem TQBF may redefined term game player called thought attempting demonstrate true another player called thought attempting demonstrate true
Supposing form play defined follows A verification game sequence move countermove possible reply guaranteed result win
Let u call problem deciding whether winning strategy TWO PLAYER SAT
As move two player mirror interpretation QBF formula difficult see TWO PLAYER SAT case TQBF
And initial quantifier may efficiently construct equivalent formula quantifier required alternating form interspersing dummy quantifier needed
It thus follows like TQBF TWO PLAYER SAT also PSPACE
Although TWO PLAYER SAT defined term simple game similar result obtained suitable variation variety well familiar board game
Consider instance following variation standard rule Go game played n board ii winner game player stone end round
demonstrated PSPACE following problem GO Given board position n game Go exist winning strategy black
player move first
Subject similar modification end game rule analogous result also obtained chess checker
What game common definition winning strategy player move first involves alternation existential universal quantifier manner mimic definition class comprise PH
Taking account suppose define TWO PLAYER SAT variant TWO PLAYER SAT wherein alternation quantifier thus follows game formula class round
TWO PLAYER SAT may shown complete class Polynomial Hierarchy
Note however value increase expect become difficult decide membership TWO PLAYER SAT much way appears become difficult determine whether given player winning strategy increasingly long game Go chess
This observation provides part reason currently expected answer Open Question positive
For see assertion PH equivalent assertion problem determining whether winning strategy verification game harder deciding question game n
A related observation bear status Open Question
For note PH PSPACE TWO PLAYER SAT would complete PH PSPACE
Since PH defined k N would follow TWO PLAYER SAT
But case would problem determining whether winning strategy verification game would harder deciding question game n
As run contrary expectation also widely believed PH PSPACE also former class differs latter failing complete problem
Even taking account current inability resolve Open Questions hierarchy complexity class depicted Figure ranging P EXP represent robust benchmark computational difficulty available
Beyond hierarchy wide array additional class also studied believed demarcate additional structure either inside P P NP
Comprehensive consideration diversity class beyond scope current survey
But complement understanding class defined relative T N useful consider three additional class NC BPP BQP defined relative model computation
One way defining NC term model computation P known PRAM machine
This model variant conventional RAM model described allows parallelism
A PRAM machine consists sequence program q n comprised finite sequence instruction performing operation register
Each program also control separate processor program counter accumulator
The processor operate parallel write common block register adopting policy resolving conflict
Finally number program hence processor comprising fixed vary size input according function q n
In way PRAM machine recruit processor operate larger input although number processor employed must fixed uniformly size input
Although PRAM model deterministic easy see member used efficiently simulate operation Turing machine recruiting sufficiently many processor carry path given computation tree parallel
This model hence member van Emde Boas second machine class considered reasonable model computation
Nonetheless P useful theoretical model provides formal medium implementing procedure call certain operation carried simultaneously parallel
It long known certain problem
matrix multiplication graph reachability sorting admit parallel algorithm case faster efficient known sequential one see
But observation would still little practical significance algorithm question achieved speed cost employ exponentially many processor relative size input
For case seems would little hope building computing device could concretely implemented
It notable however parallel algorithm problem mentioned require number processor polynomial size input also require time
O n fixed
This motivates definition NC class problem solved PRAM machine time O n using O processor fixed c k N
In particular amount defined sum number step required processor performed machine satisfying definition polynomial size input
We seen Thesis suggests P coincides class problem feasibly decided algorithm implementable relative sequential model computation T
In much way often suggested NC coincides class problem feasibly decided algorithm implemented relative parallel model P see

In particular shown PRAM machine run time O n using O processor simulated polynomial time sequential machine
From follows NC subset P
NC interest part opposite inclusion known hold
following question also open Is NC properly contained P
The current consensus like Open Questions Open Question also answered positive
In case heuristic argument derives observation NC P would case every problem possessing O sequential algorithm could sped sense admitting parallel algorithm requires time O n using O k processor
Even allowing case substantially larger thought unlikely virtue fact certain problem P appear inherently sequential sense exhibiting structure make resistant parallelization
In particular conjectured true P problem determining whether boolean circuit evaluates true formula Horn fragment propositional logic satisfiable
Another active area research complexity theory concern class defined term model computation
Instances model assumed access genuine source randomness
fair coin quantum mechanical random number generator used determine course computation
This basic idea given rise number different paradigm modeling probabilistic computation original Turing machine model N early exemplar
As seen however Turing machine employed practical model probabilistic computation

It difficult see possessed algorithm deciding implementable machine satisfying iii could correctly decide whether x arbitrarily high probability applying algorithm repeatedly checking whether majority computation accepted rejected
As standard Turing machine model T corresponds special case C follows P BPP
For long time also thought PRIMES might example problem BPP P
However know problem P virtue AKS primality algorithm
At present known candidate separating class also known NP contained BPP although latter shown included
Thus although might first seem plausible ability make random choice course computation allows u practically solve certain problem resist efficient deterministic algorithm open problem whether true
A final complexity class attracted considerable attention recent year known BQP
BQP defined analogously BPP using model Q instead model C
Such model roughly characterized device make use phenomenon entanglement interference perform operation data represented sequence

Based early suggestion number model proposed precise definition BQP based
Quantum Turing Machine
Several algorithm discovered implemented device run faster best known classical algorithm problem
Among searching unsorted database run time O whereas best possible classical algorithm O n integer factorization run O n whereas best known classical algorithm O n
Since shown quantum model simulate model classical Turing machine BQP contains P BPP
And seen BQP contains least one problem
FACTORIZATION known contained P
Although shown BQP PSPACE relationship former class NP currently well understood
In particular polynomial time quantum algorithm discovered solving NP problem implementable widely accepted model quantum computation
There also considerable controversy whether prove possible construct physical realization model sufficiently robust reliably solve instance problem currently solved using classical hardware
Even proof P BQP found empirical investigation would thus required determine bearing quantum computation either limit feasible computation status thesis
Nonetheless quantum computation active area research present
There date surprisingly little philosophical engagement computational complexity theory
Although several question origin computability theory
status Church Thesis significance effectively undecidable problem widely discussed analogous question Thesis significance effectively decidable feasibly undecidable problem attracted little attention amongst philosopher mathematics
And despite ongoing interest logical knowledge resource bounded reasoning field epistemology decision theory social choice theory recently begun make use concept result
This section attempt bridge gap highlighting connection computational complexity traditional topic logic philosophy
The appreciation complexity theory outside theoretical computer science largely due notoriety open question
Of Open Question henceforth P NP attracted greatest attention
Along long standing unresolved question pure applied mathematics Riemann Hypothesis Hodge Conjecture subject major prize competition
Millennium Problems Cook
It also frequently focus survey article popular exposition

There indeed several reason suspect resolution P NP prove far reaching practical theoretical consequence outside computer science
Perhaps significant revolves around possibility despite various heuristic argument currently offered favor hypothesis P NP remains possibility P NP true
Recall P characterized class problem membership efficiently whereas NP characterized class problem membership efficiently appropriate certificate provided
If turned P NP difficulty two task would coincide polynomial factor problem NP
Some consequence would task finding satisfying valuation propositional formula harder constructing truth table task factoring natural number would difficult verifying given factorization correct etc
Our intuition strongly reflect fact former problem pair difficult latter
But beyond collapsing distinction currently appear almost coincidence P NP would also radical effect situation currently face mathematics
For suppose T recursively axiomatic theory sufficiently strong formalize current mathematical theorizing
Zermelo Fraenkel set theory Axiom Choice ZFC supplemented needed large cardinal hypothesis
Observe regardless proof theoretic strength T following question derivability theory still presumably decidable polynomial time PROOF CHECKING T Given formula language T finite object D appropriate sort
derivation sequence tree D proof axiom T
For standard definition also case order O T length n D say measured number symbol D
We thus check derivable proof size guessing sequence symbol length checking polynomial time whether proof
It thus follows following problem NP PROVABILITY T Given formula language T natural number exist valid T D length D valid proof
We course generally interested question whether provable T restriction length derivation
case express Riemann Hypothesis T theory like ZFC
But letter von Neumann observed able efficiently decide PROVABILITY T would already enormous significance mathematical practice
For note seems plausible assume human mathematician ever able comprehend proof containing million symbol page
If able efficiently check PROVABILITY T say n obtained negative answer Gödel concludes would reason think
For case demonstration PROVABILITY T sufficiently large sufficiently powerful T would sufficient show hope ever comprehending proof even one exist
But note since PROVABILITY T NP happened P NP task determining whether mathematical formula derivable preferred mathematical theory proof feasible length would checkable efficient algorithm
Gödel suggests would following consequence Building observation several recent commentator also underscored significance Open Question suggesting P NP would entail dispensability creativity mathematics also number task
theory construction music composition traditionally thought involve element insight
But although coincidence P NP would intriguing consequence also seems likely discovery proof validating consensus view P NP would regarded foundationally significant
As seen sort evidence often cited favor proper inclusion P NP failure protracted attempt find polynomial time algorithm problem NP strong practical interest either deciding practice proving intractable
A proof P NP would thus effect validating inductive evidence would provide additional evidence Thesis provides correct analysis notion feasibility
In particular would allow u unconditionally assert NP problem intractable general case
Recall however inductive consideration form part overall evidence cited favor P NP
In particular various heuristic consideration also point class NP coNP PH PSPACE hence positive answer Open Questions
But case P NP question would resolved negatively manner run strongly counter current expectation see Sections
Given convergence several form evidence conjecture P NP also reasonable ask statement proven difficult resolve practice
For note although statement originates theoretical computer science may easily formulated statement natural number
In particular P NP equivalent statement index exponent exists propositional formula deterministic Turing machine correctly decide membership SAT step
Using familiar technique difficult see statement formalized language arithmetic
statement form x x x contains bounded numerical quantifier
Based logical form alone currently exclude possibility independent Peano arithmetic PA even stronger axiom system ZFC
But although early result suggested P NP may independent weak axiomatic theory
believed statement unlikely independent stronger theory like PA approximate mathematical axiom employ practice
In particular showed possible use current proof theoretic technique show independence PA demonstration would also show NP close P sense made precise using technique circuit complexity
As thought implausible suggests currently posse reason suspect P NP likely independent PA let alone ZFC currently open number theoretic statement
But time consensus also developed unlikely able settle status P NP basis currently known method proof
A familiar example method diagonalization employed proof undecidability classical Halting Problem follows recursive language properly included recursively enumerable one
We seen variant method used show P EXP proof Theorem
But diagonalization proof yielding separation typically relativize computation following sense proof yield C C complexity class C C suitable modification also typically yield C C oracle A
Baker Gill Solovay famously established existence oracle P NP P NP
As would expect proof P NP based diagonalization relativize suggests possible use method separate P NP
Despite negative character result often taken bear status P NP resolving open question remains important topic research theoretical computer science
Several program separating complexity class recently explored using technique circuit complexity proof theory algebraic geometry
However current consensus approach still need substantial refinement genuinely new method required order yield desired separation
It thus seems reasonable summarize current status P NP
problem follows P NP widely believed true basis convergent inductive heuristic evidence ii currently reason suspect statement formally independent mathematical theory accept practice iii proof P NP still considered beyond reach current technique

Another connection logic computational complexity provided arithmetical theory similar form familiar system Primitive Recursive Arithmetic Peano arithmetic

From onwards number similar result obtained link level Polynomial Hierarchy class theory collectively known
In course studying relationship arithmetic complexity theory often useful consider function addition set
For instance may consider class FP df function computable deterministic Turing machine polynomial time
Similarly define class function computable deterministic Turing machine polynomial time use oracle set level PH

A first link formal arithmetic complexity provided Cobham original characterization FP term functional algebra similar defined
The class question generated following class basis function F We also define following variant primitive recursion The function f x said defined g x x z x z k x case f x k x x
We define class F function definable limited recursion notation least class containing F closed composition foregoing scheme
A slight variant Cobham original result may stated follows f x FP f x F
Like Theorems Theorem significant provides another characterization important complexity class
Recall however Cobham working time mathematical status notion feasibility still debate
So also reasonable ask definition F understood providing independently motivated analysis feasible computability akin analysis Church Turing often said provided effective computability
Relative standard discussed seems reasonable maintain basis function F feasibly computable also property preserved composition
Now suppose f x defined limited recursion notation g x x z x z k x
In case f x x f x depending whether even odd
From follows depth recursion required compute value f x proportional
proportional opposed f x defined h x f x ordinary primitive recursion
This suggests feasibility also preserved function defined limited recursion notation
It harder motivate inclusion function x F condition f x k x Definition ground alone
For feature definition F see precisely effect placing polynomial bound auxiliary function computed sort recursion described
On hand indirect reference polynomial rate growth avoided similar functional characterization FP due using form positive definability string using structural modification traditional primitive recursion scheme

Since term language arithmetic polynomial positive coefficient follows Theorem provably total function I polynomial rate growth
In particular exponentiation provably total theory
For reason Parikh referred I anthropomorphic system
In order obtain arithmetical theory describe P higher level PH precisely two approach pursued respectively due
Buss presented sequence theory whose provably total function correspond level hierarchy
These theory stated language L x x intended interpretation
Whereas traditional bounded quantifier form x x form x x L involving
The syntactic class defined manner reminiscent class defined traditional arithmetical hierarchy

The direct link philosophy mathematics computational complexity theory thus far arisen context discussion view traditionally known
This view prominently associated turn best known questioning whether expression denote natural number
Presuming expression denote contended taken describe referred
number may count practice
On basis outlined foundational program wherein feasibility treated basic notion traditional argument favor validity mathematical induction uniqueness natural number series called question
Antecedents view may found

Recall one tenet traditional form finitism associated natural number conceived comprising completed infinite totality
Strict finitists sometimes described going one step actively denying infinitely many natural number
However following characteristic claim theorist explicitly endorse In emphasizing practical aspect use numeral represent natural number course performing arithmetical computation evident concern motivate strict finitism anticipate also inspired development complexity theory
Nonetheless strict finitism attracted follower
To see observe make clear strict finitists propose identify natural number familiar sequence unary numeral
If regard expression token rather type make sense consider task concretely counting number constructing unary representation sense described
For recall characteristic feature numeral may generated certain initial symbol application finite set syntactic formation rule
unary numeral generated applying formation rule initial symbol
But acknowledged also seems difficult resist following additional thesis In attempting accommodate simultaneously must confront tension led many author follow concluding strict finitism lack coherent formulation
For suppose let F x symbolize denotes feasible number sense
Then would seem follow ought accept But would also seem follow also accept accept expression denoting infeasible number
Dummett observed two different form classical intervene show iii inconsistent
For one hand applying mathematical induction
principle definite property P x natural number may infer x P x P x P x P predicate F x may conclude x F x ii
But F follows universal instantiation contradiction iii
And hand even without appealing induction contradiction also derived form conditional sorites argument deriving F result repeatedly applying series F F F F F obtained ii universal instantiation
Although would uncharitable think unaware observation first person directly reply charge inconsistent appears
His response understood consisting two part bear analysis informal notion feasibility considered Sections
On one hand Parikh considers refers PA
This theory formulated language L F x supplemented term closed primitive recursive function contains statement F fixed primitive recursive term intended denote infeasible number
Finally PA contains axiom PA induction schema restricted formula containing F x
In light latter restriction possible mimic inductive form sorites argument PA
But course PA still inconsistent virtue conditional form argument
Nonetheless Parikh showed appropriate choice proof contradiction PA must long
For instance consider x let primitive recursive term consequence Parikh result proof contradiction PA must order step long
For example proof must least line long
This suggests possibility reply behalf strict finitist Dummett argument strict finitism The inductive form sorites ruled virtue fact F x definite
property natural number
At least certain choice conditional form also threat derivation contradiction iii long carried practice
The possibility reply notwithstanding also natural ask point whether notion feasibility considered complexity theory might also vague manner could render susceptible sort soritical argument envisioned
Note however discussion thus far suggests notion feasibility strict finitists interested property
This keeping way seen notion treated complexity theory
For instance order employ Thesis judge whether problem feasibly decidable consider order growth time complexity n efficient algorithm deciding
From perspective complexity theory feasibility thus notion applies individual natural number either time complexity function type N N rate growth
Next observe following consequence thesis O
constant time feasible rate growth
Since polynomial order growth feasible follows O feasible O
order growth O feasible
On basis one might indeed fear intuition feasibly computable function codified thesis exhibit kind instability intuitively acceptable principle feasibly constructible number
To see case however observe compare growth rate f g N N standard ordering natural number rather following ordering It consequence definition O O n O O
polynomial order growth form respect
However also follows O O k N
O point infinity sitting polynomial order growth respect ordering rate growth
And follows order reached sequence feasible order growth O O n O O When analyzed according thesis hence appears naive notion feasible computability suffer sort instability Dummett take plague notion feasibly constructible number
These observation point another theme within writing strict finitists suggests also anticipate way predicate like feasible infeasible employed complexity theory
For instance suggests feasible number closed addition multiplication explicitly state regarded closed exponentiation
The possibility exponentiation understood play role formulation strict finitism also suggested fact particular example infeasible number put forth others typically employed exponential iterated exponential notation form n
This turn suggests another reply argument strict finitism
Recall theory I introduced allows u define graph exponential function via x z sense I I x z x z x z x
But seen I prove totality exponential function also shown Buss theory S
From follows theory S z z consistent
By completeness theorem logic thus exists model M language bounded arithmetic M S z z
But although follows Theorem polynomial time computable function defined input M also exists object domain M satisfying z z
And follows expression would conventionally write fails denote value M
Of course model M S z z must nonstandard
Thus must domain M infinite also exist natural number sense M infinitely many predecessor viewed outside M
One might thus first think use structure like M explore consequence strict finitism would antithetical proponent
Note however theorist typically careful avoid explicitly asserting finitely many feasible number
Instead give example expression whose denotation exist would infeasibly large
given formulation
Certainly claim feasibly constructible number would invite challenge strict finitist nominate number
And nomination would turn invite rejoinder feasibly constructible must well
But sort model M consideration definite description largest exists virtue fact element n M M z n z form proper initial segment
The existence model might thus taken elucidate claim distinct natural number sequence distinguished primitive recursive function closed
The direct link complexity theory epistemology thus far discussed mediated observation deciding logical validity related property generally computationally difficult task
For one hand traditional view epistemology
knowledge certain statement paradigm case
If correct would seem credit normal epistemic agent knowledge class logically valid sentence system propositional logic commonly taken underlie everyday reasoning
But hand result presented make clear problem deciding whether validity one system computationally intractable
The apparent clash philosophical view knowledge predict logical validity ought easy come know
virtue fact require empirical confirmation technical fact validity satisfiability problem even weakest familiar system intractable origin two development traditionally interest epistemologist problem study theory
The problem logical omniscience often presented originated within subject known
In setting knowledge treated modal operator sentence form assigned intended interpretation
The goal set axiom rule characterize reason statement form
For instance principle knowledge statement entail truth rendered principle knowledge conjunction entail knowledge conjuncts rendered
Other principle
express failure know entail know failure considered controversial
However consensus view defensible choice logic knowledge lie
The precise axiomatization adopted notwithstanding use modal logic model reasoning knowledge following two consequence VALID ii respectively report agent knowledge includes propositional tautology set sentence know closed logical consequence
Note however result seem implausible relative everyday understanding knowledge
For one hand infinitely many distinct propositional tautology even relatively short one many otherwise normal epistemic agent fail recognize
And generally acknowledged set sentence know believe least explicit sense closed logical consequence

The result summarized Sections underscore severe problem
Note first problem deciding whether given formula tautology coNP hence likely intractable
But also seen result proof complexity strongly suggest proof system agent likely adopt reasoning propositional logic
natural deduction infinitely many statement whose simplest proof length least exponential relative size
It thus likely exist short tautology
fewer propositional letter whose shortest proof conventional natural deduction system astronomically long
Similar remark apply problem determining whether finite set sentence consistent task surely epistemic import everyday reasoning
In particular readily seen consistency checking simply canonical NP problem SAT

The attempt develop model decision take resource limitation account sometimes presented counterpoint often employed economics political science
In context decision making often modeled form optimization
In particular traditionally required fully rational agent able find optimal choice among array alternative potential infeasibility carrying search amongst notwithstanding
These development serve part background debate epistemology originated Cherniak theory
Cherniak attempt provide characterization rationality responsive traditional normative characterization well complexity theoretic result difficulty deductive inference sort discussed

Algorithmic complexity concerned fast slow particular algorithm performs
We define complexity numerical function time versus input size
We want define time taken algorithm without depending implementation detail
But agree depend implementation
A given algorithm take different amount time input depending factor processor speed instruction set disk speed brand compiler etc
The way around estimate efficiency algorithm
We measure time number elementary step defined way provided step take constant time
Let u consider two classical example addition two integer
We add two integer digit digit bit bit define step computational model
Therefore say addition two integer take n step
Consequently total computational time time taken addition two bit
On different computer additon two bit might take different time say c c thus additon two integer take respectively
This show different machine result different slope time grows linearly input size increase
The process abstracting away detail determining rate resource usage term input size one fundamental idea computer science
The goal computational complexity classify algorithm according performance
We represent time function T n using notation express algorithm runtime complexity
For example following statement Intuitively mean function f n grow faster g n function g n f n sufficiently large Here graphic representation f n O g n relation The notation symmetric n O n n O n

Let u prove n n O n
We must find c n n n
Let n n An algorithm said run constant time requires amount time regardless input size
Examples An algorithm said run linear time time execution directly proportional input size
time grows linearly input size increase
Examples An algorithm said run logarithmic time time execution proportional logarithm input size
Example Recall twenty question game task guess value hidden number interval
Each time make guess told whether guess i high low
Twenty question game imploies strategy us guess number halve interval size
This example general method known Note log n n
Algorithms run O log n use whole input
An algorithm said run logarithmic time time execution proportional square input size
Examples Consider dynamic array stack

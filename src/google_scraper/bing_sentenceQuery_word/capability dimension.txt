capability system network process handle growing amount work potential enlarged accommodate growth
For example system considered scalable capable increasing total output increased load resource typically hardware added
An analogous meaning implied word used context company scalability implies underlying offer potential within company
Scalability property system generally difficult define particular case necessary define specific requirement scalability dimension deemed important
It highly significant issue electronics system database router networking
A system whose performance improves adding hardware proportionally capacity added said
An design system said suitably practical applied large situation
large input data set large number output user large number participating node case distributed system
If design system fails quantity increase
In practice large number thing affect scaling resource requirement example algorithmic must grow le increase
An example search engine scale number user also number object index
Scalability refers ability site increase size demand warrant
The concept scalability desirable technology well setting
The base concept consistent ability business technology accept increased volume without impacting
For example given piece equipment may capacity user beyond user additional equipment needed performance decline variable cost increase reduce contribution margin
Scalability measured various dimension Methods adding resource particular application fall two broad category horizontal vertical scaling
There tradeoff two model
Larger number computer mean increased management complexity well complex programming model issue throughput latency node also
In past price difference two model favored scale computing application fit paradigm recent advance virtualization technology blurred advantage since deploying new virtual system possible often le expensive actually buying installing real one
Configuring existing idle system always le expensive buying installing configuring new one regardless model
scaling ability scale resource instance
virtual machine whereas scaling ability scale changing allocated resource
capacity A number different approach enable grow large size supporting rate
Not discounted course rapid pace hardware advance speed capacity device well similar advance CPU networking speed
One technique supported major product large table based range value key field
In manner database across cluster separate
Also advent CPUs large DBMS vendor forefront supporting implementation substantially capacity
coupled fast local area network technology enable still larger loosely coupled configuration database distributed computing power
The widely supported standard employ global transaction monitor coordinate among database resource
us different model achieve scalability based architecture relies upon connection server
While DBMS vendor debate relative merit favored design company researcher question inherent limitation
example contends entirely different model distributed data access transaction processing required achieve highest performance scalability
On hand make case extreme scalability without departing mainstream relational database technology
For specialized application architecture Google enhance scalability
Google massively distributed technology positioned successor BigTable support provides conventional query language
In context scalability defined maximum storage cluster size guarantee full data consistency meaning ever one valid version stored data whole cluster independently number redundant physical data copy
Clusters provide lazy redundancy updating copy asynchronous fashion called
This type design suitable availability responsiveness rated higher consistency true many web file hosting service web cache
For classical application design avoided
Many open source even commercial storage cluster especially built top standard PC hardware network provide
Idem NoSQL database like others mentioned
Write operation invalidate copy often wait acknowledgement
Read operation typically check every redundant copy prior answering potentially missing preceding write operation
The large amount metadata signal traffic would require specialized hardware short distance handled acceptable performance
act like storage device database
Whenever strong data consistency expected look indicator Indicators design suitable transactional application
It often advised focus system design hardware scalability rather capacity
It typically cheaper add new node system order achieve improved performance partake improve capacity node handle
But approach diminishing return discussed
For example suppose program sped parallelized run multiple CPUs instead one
If fraction calculation sequential fraction parallelized maximum achieved using P processor given according Substituting value example using processor get If double compute power processor get Doubling processing power improved speedup roughly
If whole problem parallelizable would course expect speed double also
Therefore throwing hardware necessarily optimal approach
In context two common notion scalability

It Friday evening

concept design system one existing
A known system communicable unforgeable authority
It refers value along associated set
A must use capability access object
security refers principle designing user program directly share capability according operating system infrastructure necessary make transaction efficient secure
security contrasted approach us
Although operating system implement facility resembles capability typically provide enough support allow exchange capability among possibly mutually untrusting entity primary mean granting distributing access right throughout system
A system contrast designed goal mind
Capabilities discussed article confused
The latter privilege transferred process
Capabilities achieve objective improving system security used place forgeable
A forgeable reference example identifies object specify access right appropriate object user program hold reference
Consequently attempt access referenced object must validated operating system based requesting program typically via use ACL
Instead system capability mere fact user program posse capability entitles use referenced object accordance right specified capability
In theory system capability remove need access control list similar mechanism giving entity capability actually need
A capability typically implemented consists section specifies access right section uniquely identifies object accessed
The user access data structure object directly instead via
In practice used much like traditional operating system traditional handle access every object system
Capabilities typically stored operating system list mechanism place prevent program directly modifying content capability forge access right change object point
Some system also based hardware support capability
Programs possessing capability perform function passing program converting version deleting
The operating system must ensure specific operation occur capability system order maintain integrity security policy
A defined protected reference virtue possession user process grant process capability hence name interact object certain way
Those way might include reading data associated object modifying object executing data object process conceivable access right
The capability logically consists reference uniquely identifies particular object set one right
Suppose user process memory space exists following string Although identifies unique object system specify access right hence capability
Suppose instead following two value This identifies object along set access right
It however still capability user process value say nothing whether access would actually legitimate
Now suppose user program successfully executes following statement The variable contains index file descriptor process file descriptor table
This file descriptor capability
Its existence process file descriptor table sufficient know process indeed legitimate access object
A key feature arrangement file descriptor table directly manipulated user program
In traditional operating system program often communicate storage using reference like first two example
Path name often passed parameter sent via socket stored disk
These reference capability must validated used
In system central question whose given reference evaluated
This becomes critical issue especially process must act behalf two different entity
They become susceptible programming error known frequently resulting
In system capability passed process storage using mechanism known operating system maintain integrity capability
One novel approach solving problem involves use operating system
This realised
See
In system need entity discarded capability invalidated hence require mechanism restore capability later time
The operating system maintains integrity security capability contained within storage volatile nonvolatile time part performing task rather requiring user program case operating system
Because user program relieved responsibility need trust reproduce legal capability validate request access using mechanism
POSIX draft specifies concept permission called capability
However POSIX capability differ capability capability associated object process capability listen TCP port
In contrast Capsicum capability FreeBSD Linux hybridize true model UNIX design POSIX API
Capsicum capability refined form file descriptor delegable right process additional object type beyond classic POSIX process referenced via capability
In Capsicum capability mode process unable utilize global namespaces filesystem namespace look object must instead inherit delegated
Research commercial system employing security include following currently used POSIX capability Linux

Software tends slapdash best We like ship anything look like might completely broken
And thing fine If favorite app fine
However software becomes increasingly integral really need worry quality
When failure lead hundred million dollar damage actual death revealing identity dissident aggressive government software quality suddenly becomes moral imperative Other form engineering specific ethical guideline professional organization
But since software decidedly engineering sense model make sense programming
So manage risk software quality
Another possibility enabling much government power
In past lack capability naturally held government check
They could shadow everyone always simply manpower
But
The government combine pervasive surveillance data analysis follow everyone everywhere listen everything
A bit chilling

In fact extent already happens place like London
Do feel safer know watching

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Stack Inspection security mechanism introduced JVM deal running code originating location different level trust
This question aim finding simple description functionality
So How stack inspection work
See From paper
The stack inspection algorithm used current Java system thought generalization following model In model principal
Likewise privilege available This model resembles stack inspection system used internally Netscape Navigator
In model every stack frame labeled principal frame executing code part virtual machine library otherwise contains privilege flag may set system class chooses privilege explicitly stating want something dangerous
An untrusted class set privilege flag
When stack frame exit privilege flag automatically disappears
All procedure perform dangerous operation accessing file system network first apply stack inspection algorithm decide whether access allowed
The stack inspection algorithmsearches frame stack sequence newest oldest
The search terminates allowing access upon finding stack frame privilege flag
The search also terminates forbidding access throwing exception upon finding untrusted stack frame could never gotten privilege flag

Code Inspection formal type review kind static testing avoid defect multiplication later stage
The main purpose code inspection find defect also spot process improvement
An inspection report list finding include metric used aid improvement process well correcting defect document review
Preparation meeting essential includes reading source document ensure consistency
Inspections often led trained moderator author code
The inspection process formal type review based rule checklist make use entry exit criterion
It usually involves peer examination code one defined set role
After meeting formal process used ensure corrective action completed timely manner

In ability examine modify structure behavior
The earliest computer programmed native inherently reflective original architecture could programmed defining instruction data using
As programming moved compiled language also many language reflective ability largely disappeared programming language reflection built type system appeared
doctoral dissertation introduced notion computational reflection procedural notion component
Reflection used observing modifying program execution runtime
A program component monitor execution enclosure code modify according desired goal related enclosure
This typically accomplished dynamically assigning program code runtime
In programming language reflection allows class interface field method runtime without knowing name interface field method compile time
It also allows new object method
Reflection used adapt given program different situation dynamically
programming almost always requires additional knowledge framework relational mapping object relevance order take advantage generic code execution
Reflection often used part runtime
Reflection also key strategy
In programming language reflection used override rule
For example reflection make possible change value field marked private library class
A language supporting reflection provides number feature available runtime would otherwise difficult accomplish language
Some feature ability These feature implemented different way
In reflection form natural part everyday programming idiom
When verb method called various variable name verb called object verb called populated give context call
Security typically managed accessing caller stack programmatically Since list method current verb eventually called performing test command invoked original user allows verb protect unauthorised use
Compiled language rely runtime system provide information source code
A compiled executable example record name method block executable providing table correspond underlying method selector method compiled program
In compiled language support runtime creation function runtime environment must include compiler interpreter
Reflection implemented language reflection facility using system define automated change
The following code snippet create invoke
For normal call sequence shown
The following example This example assumes class declared unit called This notable example since Delphi unmanaged fully natively compiled language unlike language support reflection
Its language architecture inherits strongly typed Pascal significant influence SmallTalk
Compare example many dynamic script language like Perl Python PHP language runtime like Java C
The following example The following example therefore also applies The following example The following example The following example implying either framework used The following example The following example The following example The following example The following example

Software Development Magazine Project Management Programming Software Testing Jason Cohen Smart Bear Software Two year ago I meeting CTO software development shop I know I walked room
I asked head Software Process Metrics come talk new type lightweight code review success
But CTO made clear presence Not Appreciated
You see explained already code inspection
Michael Fagan invented inspection company teaching u
His face completed silent conclusion And sir Michael Fagan
Currently code inspected offered advocate
We believe end year get
Here Metrics stopped shot glance CTO
The latter face fell
Whatever coming obviously discussion
The problem ca inspect
Given number hour take complete Fagan inspection time inspect new code write
My next question obvious What going
Their stare equally obvious role convince CTO answer
This story happy ending get I explain mean inspect code developer manager process engineer think hear code review
It reason company could review code developer idea
And changing notion mean review code mean liberating developer get benefit code review without process formal inspection
If ever read anything peer code review know Michael Fagan credited first published formalized system code review
His technique developed IBM demonstrably removed defect kind document design spec assembly code
To day technique resembling carry moniker code inspection
I going describe code inspection brief brace
This heavyweight process finest bear
It soon I promise
A code inspection consists seven phase
In Planning Phase author gather Materials ensures meet Entry Criteria determines participate inspection
There four participant four distinct role The Author Moderator Reviewer Reader
Sometimes Observer
All participant need invited first several meeting meeting must scheduled various participant
This first meeting kick Introduction Phase Author explains background motivation goal review
All participant get printed copy Materials
This important Fagan Inspection unless printed
The participant schedule next meeting leave
This start Reading Phase person read Materials role read different purpose important one identifies defect
When next meeting convenes start Inspection Phase
The Moderator set pace meeting make sure everyone performing role ruining anything personal attack
The Reader present Materials job read comprehension since often someone else misunderstanding indicates fault Materials
During meeting Defect Log kept Author know need fixed
Before meeting end complete rubric help later process improvement
If defect found inspection enters Rework Phase Author fix problem later Verification Phase make sure fix appropriate open new defect
Finally inspection enter Completed Phase
Figure Typical workflow formal inspection
Not shown artifact created review The defect log meeting note metric log
Some inspection also closing questionnaire used meeting The good news work
It uncovers defect help training new hire whole process measured process insight improvement
If extra money laying around budget Fagan even come show
The bad news obvious day Agile Methodologies
Studies show average inspection take per line code CTO could every code change company
Over year experiment case study book subject almost always using form code inspection basis
In survey published case study experiment past year found tried inspection small pilot group able apply technique software development project
But surely another way
Fagan inspection designed day business logic written assembly language computer science major dinosaur roamed earth
Have learned nothing since
Do need different technique reading code application
Do challenge development require new process
Has rise Agile Methodologies shown u process metric measurement improvement happy developer time
So finish story already
By guess story end
Using argument unlike Metrics I convinced CTO least try lightweight code review technique pilot program one development group already hopelessly opposed Fagan inspection
The metric came group demonstrated effectiveness lightweight system within month Code Collaborator deployed across entire organization
Assuming bought argument code review good heavyweight inspection process practical next question How make review practical
explore four lightweight technique This common informal easiest
code review
An review developer standing author workstation author walk reviewer set code change
Figure A typical code process
Typically review artifact created
Typically author drive review sitting keyboard mouse opening various file pointing change explaining
The author present change using various tool even go back forth change file project
If reviewer see something amiss engage little spot author writes fix reviewer hovers
Bigger change reviewer need involved taken
With modern software review made work long distance although complicate process need schedule sharing meeting communicate phone
The obvious advantage review simplicity execution
Anyone time without training
It also deployed whenever need especially complicated change alteration stable code branch
Before I list pro con I like consider certain effect type review exhibit
Because author controlling pace review often reviewer get chance good job
The reviewer might given enough time ponder complex portion code
The reviewer get chance poke around source file check verify API used correctly
The author might explain something clarifies code reviewer next developer read code wo advantage explanation unless encoded comment code
It difficult reviewer objective aware issue driven code expectant developer peering
So This common form lightweight code review technique preferred project
Here whole file change packaged author sent reviewer via email
Reviewers examine file ask question discus author developer suggest change
Figure
Typical process review code already checked version control system
These phase distinct reality tangible review object
The hardest part email finding collecting file review
On author end figure gather file together
For example review change proposed check version control user identify file added deleted modified copy somewhere download previous version file reviewer see changed organize file reviewer know file compared others
On reviewing end reviewer extract file email generate difference
The version control system assist process sending email automatically
The automation helpful many code review process want require review
Like review email fairly easy implement
They also work well across hall across ocean
A unique advantage review ease people brought conversation whether expert advice complete deferral
And unlike email break developer zone working review done whenever reviewer chance
The biggest drawback review quickly become unreadable mass comment reply code snippet especially others invited talk several discussion different part code
It also hard manage multiple review time
Imagine developer Hyderabad opening Outlook discover email different people discussing aspect three different code change made last day
It take dig though real work begin
Another problem indication review done
Emails fly around length time
The review done everyone stop talking
So Most people associate XP agile development general
Among thing development process incorporates continuous code review
two developer writing code single workstation one developer typing time continuous discussion review
Studies shown effective finding bug promoting knowledge transfer
And developer really enjoy
Or forget making developer happy important
There controversial issue whether review better worse complementary standard review
The reviewing developer deeply involved code giving great thought issue consequence arising different implementation
On one hand give reviewer lot inspection time deep insight problem hand perhaps mean review effective
On hand closeness exactly want reviewer author see typo writing reviewer close code step back critique fresh unbiased position
Some people suggest using technique deep review standard review fresh eye
Although take lot developer time implement would seem technique would find greatest number defect
We never seen anyone practice
The single biggest complaint take much time
Rather reviewer spend minute reviewing change took one developer day make two developer task entire time
Of course benefit full discussion beyond scope article
So This refers process specialized tool used aspect review collecting file transmitting displaying file commentary defect among participant collecting metric giving product manager administrator control workflow
refer project commercial software script
Either way mean money either paying tool paying folk create maintain
Plus make sure tool match desired workflow way around
Therefore tool better provide many advantage worthwhile
Specifically need fix major problem foregoing type review As discussed email developer wasting time collecting file I changed difference
Ideally tool able collect change checked version control
One biggest type review reviewer developer associate particular file line number
The tool must able display file file difference manner conversation threaded one spend time comment defect source code
On one hand accurate metric way understand process way measure change occur change process
On hand developer want review code holding stopwatch wielding tool
A tool automates collection key metric way keep developer happy extra work get meaningful metric process
A full discussion review metric mean mean appear another article tool least collect three thing inspection rate defect rate defect density
Almost type review suffer problem product manager knowing whether developer reviewing code change whether reviewer verifying defect indeed fixed cause new defect
A tool able enforce workflow least reporting level passive workflow enforcement best version control level trigger
Some developer like tool
Others need integration IDE version control GUI client
Administrators like web client Web Services API
It important tool support many way read write data system
If tool satisfies list requirement benefit email review work multiple developer minimizes interruption without problem workflow enforcement metric wasting time packaging delivery inspection
It impossible give proper list pro con review depends tool feature
But tool satisfies requirement able combat con
All technique useful result better code would otherwise
To pick right one start top list work way
The first simplest willing live downside stop
review potential remove downside commit trial period competitive analysis possibly budget allocation
No matter pick developer find code review great way find bug mentor new hire share information
Just make sure implement technique aggravate much revolt

also known code refers possibly indicates deeper problem
According code smell surface indication usually corresponds deeper problem system
Another way look smell respect principle quality smell certain structure code indicate violation fundamental design principle negatively impact design quality
Code smell usually technically incorrect currently prevent program functioning
Instead indicate weakness design may slowing development increasing risk bug failure future
Bad code smell indicator factor contribute
call list code smell value system software craftsmanship
Often deeper problem hinted code smell uncovered code subjected short small controlled step resulting design examined see code smell indicate need refactoring
From point view programmer charged performing refactoring code smell indicate refactor specific refactoring technique use
Thus code smell driver refactoring
A study utilizing automated analysis half million manual examination commits determined exhibit code smell found The term appears coined late
Usage term increased featured
also term used programmer
Determining code smell subjective varies language developer development methodology
There tool automatically check certain kind code smell
smell smell smell

inserted randomly random readability said July UTC For September deletion debate page see There might three Perl people use term rare article edge validity
This would make sense single sentence
May UTC Whether code generation code smell debatable
The article indicates violates code generation way achieve programming environment language target platform otherwise possible
Since example dubious article lose ability demonstrate concept code smell without I removed example
February UTC At superficial overview seems criterion code smell sound reading link seems criterion counteracts criterion
An indication late introduction give hand general longlived naïve belief
For article fulfills important purpose I propose enhancing criterion list problematize real problem OO philosophy especially XP philosophy belief real problem solved
For far future I would hope emerged numeric measure fair balancing one criterion others CompSci reach take decennium
said July UTC Determining code smell often subjective judgment misspelling really need citation
It seems like common sense
Like bad naming etc
November UTC Some additional smell I routinely encounter Use globals language support reusable object would better
Use switch achieve variant behavior polymorphic object would server better
October UTC Is common term Google show wikipedia
Is callback everything reasonable artefact Strategy pattern
January UTC I know proposed article merged Refactoring I surprised see discussion proposal page
I like say I disagree
In fact I think page expanded encorporate information smell example alternative possible
This article could ultimately become quite extensive would inappropriate merge
July UTC I also agree merging
The ACM Digital Library hundred article relevant phrase clearly legitimate topic research therefore important term define
October I agree merging well
Code smell could hint bigger problem design interface arrangement code
Code refactoring could solution problem
As said certainly related deserve separate extensive page
January Since consensus seemed merging I removed merge template
And way previous edit made January October still future writing I corrected timestamp
February UTC And thats fact
I know codersphere filled rate code monkies would love make mark world
But hard prove negative huge investment beleive article person want real
FOR DELETE I edited bulleted list summarizing empirical study lead section correct contradiction edit reversed without explanation
The first two bullet list contain two mutually contradictory statement These two statement correct
When I referred cited study linked footnote I found never claim code smell introduced adding new feature enhancing existing one
I made change consistent study eliminates contraction
I invite respond criticism explanation criticism invalid

Daniel Ryder This blog describes common code smell
A code smell surface indication usually corresponds deeper problem Being able catch code smell early make easier refactor code extendable readable supportable
Having long method make code harder maintain debug
It also difficult read keep lot complex logic mind reading long method
Ideally method one responsibility
Inheritance always best model use
If inherited method go unused overridden nothing could sign code smell
Inheritance used class need reuse code superclass
If multiple method take type parameter sign parameter probably related
The parameter combined together class keep together help keep code organized
For example instead method three parameter They combined class reference class object passed parameter list This idea Don Repeat Yourself design principle
Duplicate code unnecessary create similar bug different part code
If class exists delegate another class ask really necessary
If class justify existence removed
Primitive type give little domain context always clear
Where primitive domain meaning good idea wrap small class represent idea
Comments provide little value reiterate read developer especially updated longer reflect current code
Before adding comment clarify piece code try refactor code comment longer needed
I chose blog post code smell another topic concept map
They similar design principle aware make sure good coding practice followed
Like design principle I applying I learned future code
The blog I read better understanding I code structured one important learning outcome class

Wikipedia provides Code Smells I want open one everyone add thought one IMMEDIATELY came mind debt issuance maintenance
I see continuously
Cities convince cash flow problem really insolvency problem
Believing simply short money realizing insolvent stuff regular cash flow covering
This extra pernicious current taxpayer feel squeeze enjoying higher level service without paying future taxpayer experience consequence bad policy call austerity somehow suggest choice
This spends interest debt spend sidewalk maintenance
When I see city manager city engineer key staff recommending huge debt issuance include statement cash flow recommendation well Code Smell signal something right
I watched city go dance last year become outraged newspaper
And note basic critique another Code Smell

Leslie bachelor degree English Journalism University Southern California
Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position

said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

I took digital electronics class I used Karnaugh mapping chip designed thermostat using Boolean algebra binary math
It called opposite rule
You think nothing wrong saying guy swap opposite understand feel excluded
That sound u
Trinity said We men please quit using term guy talking others
I female happen good linear algebra matrix
I best programmer class much professor used example slide show
This ridiculous men treat u invisible smart
Jasmine said Trinity forgive might I say
arent Guys refer men AND woman
Just like word men MAN refer woman well
If said boy male well might problem really get ur panty place belong
Im sure quite comfy uh check I female well
Over
Trinity said For woman
The CS degree worth
Go
I
Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right
IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year
Random Awesomeness said discourage people KIDS especially woman want computer please give reason people computer science
Wolfee GameZ said Yea boi game design would good choice knowing code knowing language
Would also help look animation easier opinion
Those two major thing used game
yeye John Doe said Hey everyone Thanks comment really helped
I college student getting basic way
I always loved computer I pretty good user level
I know HTML access command stuff I never formal education tried learn another coding language I never failed math generally making Bs As strongest subject
Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get
Any advice appreciated thank much

Maybe like Excel formula hidden away number produce check box check But Excel spreadsheet tricky hide kind thing number
This opacity cause risk
One study researcher University Hawaii found percent spreadsheet
Programming also look like Scratch language kid That definitely programming right computer waiting click input wait type something repetitive involves hilarious animal
Or maybe That Fortran
The reason working forgot put quotation mark end first line
Try little harder thanks
All thing coding one kind another last bit programmer would readily identify code
A sequence symbol using typical keyboard character saved file kind someone typed copied pasted elsewhere
That mean kind coding valid help achieve goal
Coding broad human activity like sport writing
When software developer think coding thinking line code file
They handed problem think problem write code solve problem expect computer turn word deed
Code inert
How make ert
You run software transforms machine language
The word language little ambitious given make computing device wood marble
Your goal turn code explicit list instruction carried interconnected logic gate thus turning code something
A compiler software take symbol typed file transforms instruction
Imagine programming language called Business Operating Language United System Bolus
It terrible language suffice awkward paragraph
It one real command
We want print screen
To end write line code text file say And save
Now run imaginary compiler program
How start
The way lexical analysis going character character starting p grouping character token saving tree box
Let computer
The reason I showing see every character matter
Computers usually understand thing going character character bit bit transforming code kind code go
The Bolus compiler organizes token little tree
Kind like sentence diagram
Except instead noun verb adjective computer looking function argument
Our program inside computer becomes Trees really pleasant way thinking world
Your memo work section paragraph
Tree
Your program contains message contain subject line address
Tree
Your favorite software program menu bar individual item subitems
Tree
Every day Arbor Day Codeville
Of course trick
If cut open computer find countless little box row place put retrieve byte
Everything ultimately get thing little box pointing
That thing work
So tree actually like Every character truly truly matter
Every single stupid misplaced semicolon space meant tab bracket instead leave computer state panic
The tree know put leaf
Their root decay
The box stack neatly
For computer dumb billion marble also positively Stradivarian delicacy
That process going character character wrapped called function method subroutine component
Little computing single reliable name mean everyone always arguing semantics
And routine run often need
Second print anything wish one phrase
Third repeat process forever nothing stop machine break barring heat death universe
Obviously one besides Jack Nicholson really need keep typing phrase even turned bad idea
Instead worrying word stored memory go character character programming language let think thing like string array tree
That programming give
You may look programmer shoulder think code look complex boring covering repetitive boredom unimaginably vast
This thing individual character compiling program fake assembly language nonexistent computer print character one time
The principle applies every pixel screen every frequency encoded file every imaginary cube Minecraft
Computing treat human language arbitrary set symbol sequence
It treat music imagery film way

Thinking way teach two thing computer One magic matter much look like
There work make thing look like magic
And two crazy
Algorithm word writer invoke sound smart technology
Journalists tend talk Facebook algorithm Google algorithm usually inaccurate
They mean Algorithms require computer geometry
An algorithm solves problem great algorithm get name
Dijkstra algorithm famed computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra find shortest path graph
By way graph mean rather
Think map street connect street intersection
It graph
There graph around
Plumbing electricity code compilation social network Internet represented graph
Now monetize Many algorithm page Wikipedia
You spend day poking around wonder
example specimen show whenever anyone want wax algorithm buck trend
It simple way determining greatest common divisor two number
Take two number like
Divide first second
If remainder case divide smaller number remainder give remainder greatest common divisor
Now translate machine code get
There site called Rosetta Code show different algorithm different language
The great
Some example suspiciously long laborious tiny nonsense poetry like one language Forth Read loud preferably friend
Forth based concept stack special data structure
You make word thing stack building little language
PostScript language laser printer came Forth much like
Look similar code give take squiggle And Euclid algorithm PostScript
I admit might fun
Here Python credit Rosetta Code A programming language system encoding naming organizing algorithm reuse application
It algorithm management system
This despite hype silly say Facebook algorithm
An algorithm translated function function called run software executed
There algorithm relate image processing storing data efficiently rapidly running element list
Most algorithm come free already built programming language available organized library download Internet moment
You ton programming without actually thinking save something database print Web page cutting pasting code
But want computer say identify whether reading Spanish Italian need write function
So sense algorithm pure mathematical entity well practical expression idea place grubby hand
Dijkstra distributed remarkable challenging set least memo global computer science community starting continuing death known EWDs many
One thing took forever understand computer actually good They programmed execute certain operation certain degree precision much look like math human
Dijkstra said Computer science computer astronomy A huge part computer science understanding efficiency long take run

Tons algorithm bundled applied mean computer fake listening
A programming language least two job
It need wrap lot algorithm reused
Then need go looking algorithm genius programmer every time need square root
And make easy programmer wrap new algorithm routine function reuse
The DRY principle Don Repeat Yourself one colloquial tenet programming
That name thing thing create function let computer repeat
This always work
Programmers repeat constantly
I written certain kind code hundred time
This DRY principle
Enough talk

Fine
TMitTB fair clothes often dress like Weezer check every week
He brings document

From list various error message
It sort blueprint word occasional program exist
Some part functional specification refer user story tiny hypothetical narrative people using site As visitor website I want search product I quickly purchase I Then something TMitTB call wireframe picture website look created program make everything seem sketched hand little though produced computer
This one get wrong idea take seriously
Patronizing point taken
You rarely see TMitTB person often conference present panel
He tweet panel note LinkedIn page
Often take picture audience stage see assembly mostly men many beard majority seem peering laptop instead stage
Nonetheless tweet accompanies photo say something like AMAZING audience
panel microservice architecture He often tell important purpose recruiting
Who say wrong
It cost much hire senior programmer hire midlevel executive maybe going conference job two month hired four people
His two recent hire Boston Hungary neither place office
But matter
Every day standup meeting via something called Slack essentially like Google Chat sort plaid visual theme programmer seem agree wonderful fruitful way work
I watch commits TMitTB say
Meaning every day review code team writes make sure
No one pushing production without test passing
We Your meeting comparison go hour people arranged around
You wonder get programmer stand already use standing desk
Perhaps ticket
Honestly would like go conference sometimes panel
You could drink bottled water hold forth fine
Conferences
The website Lanyrd list hundred technology conference June
There event software tester Chicago Twitter conference São Paulo one enterprise content management Amsterdam
In New York alone Big Apple Scrum Day Razorfish Tech Summit entrepreneurship boot camp veteran conference dedicated digital mapping many conference digital marketer one dedicated one Ruby one Scala programming language couple breakfast conference cascading style sheet one text analytics something called Employee Engagement Awards
Tech conference look like expect
Tons people Sheraton keynote Ballroom Or enormous stream people wandering South Southwest Austin
People come together dozen thousand attend panel ostensibly learn attend presentation brush skill secondary conference function one acculturation
You go technology conference affirm tribal identity transfer throng dilettante zone professional
You pick swag talk vendor thing

Then panel group people lined row forced semblance interaction audience check
I little panel
They tend drift
I sure exist
Here thing technology conference There much sexual harassment much sexist content conference
Which stupid computer dumb rock lacking genitalia
Women software enough started write post blog
Other woman
The problem pervasive There lot conference many report harassing behavior
The language Ruby preferred language startup bros developed worst reputation
At Ruby conference someone gave talk subtitled Perform Like Star sexy slide
That dispiriting
There criminal incident
Conferences began develop code conduct rule algorithm people men really follow
If subject witness unacceptable behavior concern please notify community organizer soon possible php architect dedicated providing event experience everyone tolerate harassment offensive behavior form
The Atlanta Java Users Group AJUG dedicated providing outstanding conference experience attendee speaker sponsor volunteer organizer involved DevNexus GeekyNerds regardless gender sexual orientation disability physical appearance body size race religion financial status hair color hair amount platform preference text editor choice
When people started talking conference behavior also began talk larger problem programming culture
This always issue conference issue gave people point common reference
Why many men field
Why behave strangely
Why hard group female programmer behave typical adult way
I go work I stick like sore thumb
I mistaken administrative assistant
I asked I physical security despite security wearing distinctive uniform wrote Erica Joy Baker worked among place Google
Always woman meeting often first female R D engineer first female project lead first female software team company I worked wrote another woman magazine

These number whole company programmer
That lot woman get stock option
The number people white Asian worse yet
Apple gave million fund diversity initiative equivalent percent market cap
Intel million diversity project
The average programmer moderately diligent capable basic mathematics working knowledge one programming language communicate management peer
Given significant number woman work journalist editor perform surgery run company manage small business use spreadsheet even serve Supreme Court longer surprised find woman working accountant professor statistician project manager hard imagine write JavaScript
Programming despite hype fantasy programmer world intellectually demanding task imaginable
Which lead one inescapable conclusion The problem woman technology woman
Many conference organized around specific programming language specific community PyCon Python programmer Strata conference big data Oscon coder ritual event people community
Attendees gather talk post video YouTube
Language matter
Programmers track success computer language way people track sport ranking commenting Web forum Reddit many language get subreddit currently reader run venture capital firm Y Combinator company named special kind function operates function named series paper written mostly influential programming language name nerdier subject matter
There hundred programming blog
Many large corporation let engineer blog generous gift given many recruiter hovering
Discussions programming go everywhere public time hundred language
There keen sense coming fading
It simply fashion one career programmer depends demonstrating capacity one language
So ranking frequently updated rarely shocking
As April world computer language according Tiobe index us variety indicator generate single ranking world programming Java C C followed JavaScript PHP Python
The ranking necessarily inexact another list consulting firm called RedMonk give JavaScript top spot followed Java
There many possible conclusion obvious one thing equal good Java programmer performs well interview career option similar candidate using obscure language
If code time language break top heard read blog post heard people lament terrible wonderful misguided possibly watched video tutorial played little
Taking new language spin good thing programmer
Often download file write couple line code decide want go
Most language free download use
Why people construct give away free language
Well creation good computer language work apex programmer
To produced successful language acknowledged monumental effort akin publishing multivolume history war fighting one
The reward glory
Changing language like fighting war language time trapped liminal state old busted self new promised version
Perl released language uniquely suited World Wide Web grew Web grew Perl supposed better every way redesign began grand pronouncement

Latest ETA Christmas
The Python language community keenly aware Perl community problem decided make necessary difficult change language part transition Version Version
They would modernize clean rough avoid grand reinventions
Development Python started first working version came transition ongoing
Making new language hard
Making popular language much harder still requires smile fortune

A language software making software
The standard library set premade software reuse reapply
Take Python battery included meaning come ton preexisting code organized module reuse
Its standard library function let copy Web page replace word document
What mean process text
Well might string text The Quick Brown Fox save variable called
So call standard method string
You say make word lowercase producing quick brown Truly understanding language standard library one way one becomes proficient language
Typically visit Web page read book
But standard library beginning
For many Python enormous library prewritten module available nearly instantaneous download using package manager software
A module library package code intended extend language capability
Let say work advertising agency need process picture scale sharpen
You type one command Pillow module downloaded compiled automatically placed correct directory later reuse
You know course modern language module image processing also need know Pillow commonly used toolkit
Knowing find part job coding
You might learn Googling
You might ask friend
You might get information book website like The Hitchhiker Guide Python
A coder need able quickly examine identify giant complex library one recently actively updated best match current need
A coder need good listener
But payoff
Now Pillow installed typing fingertip dozen routine function related image processing use code change color rotate number degree scale convert GIF image JPEGs forth
Or need complex numerical analysis statistic work download NumPy suddenly enormous range mathematical algorithm available hundred year science research boiled
Audio processing interacting peculiar hardware speaking package thing

If know thing spend time searching instead building cool new thing
If computer language thing make computer want matter one choose

It use text much allows li l coder move icon around screen assemble program like Legos
Its logo smiling cat two leg
And Lisp come logo first proposed alien holding flag proboscis
Lisp classic language
There language authority computer language
And one Most popular language look lot like
C de facto logo well letter C called C came another language
That language called B
C big deal get computing
Created Dennis Ritchie starting late Bell Labs principal development language UNIX operating system
Unix lowercased refer idea Unix instead branded version simple operating kernel manages memory run software large collection small utility program shell help knit program shell If needed shell script might write new utility C add utility library
This nice practical way working coincided rise various kind network today refer collectively Internet
So Unix spread Bell Labs academia large industrial system eventually leached water supply computing everywhere
And everywhere Unix went C sure go
C simple language simple like shotgun blow foot
It allows manage every last part memory file hard great meticulous dangerous sloppy
Software made C known fast
When compile C simply become bunch machine language one go many step making really ridiculously fast
These called optimization programming loophole tax
Think C sort grandfather grew trapping beaver served several war still pullups
C legendary lucid manual specification written Ritchie Brian Kernighan known nickname K R quick simple light comparison modern guide programming bookstore shelf
This recommended text published personal computing barely existed back computer large piece industrial equipment used control refrigeration system calculate actuarial table
It K R Hello world became canonical example program language
By convention almost every introduction programming language since start variation Hello world Here computational Which compiled run print Hello world screen
Let write program give number x print square number sort practical useful program always appears programming tutorial address need people urgently require list square
To compile program Macintosh I saved opened typed And produced That run GNU C Compiler produce default file called I ran command line get squared number bully
If I wanted change code I would run command program would update accordingly
This great code stretch
You need squint little see small repeatable unit fit together certain way
There function called square
That important part
You feed number integer
Then count integer count print square number
Then print new line
Done
The Linux kernel written The software connects printer computer could The Web server serve Web page often written It also good language writing PHP Perl written C many others
C language use building system role computing Latin among Renaissance academic
You often meet serious practitioner digital art least passing familiarity
The serious scholar pretty fluent
But remember list popular language


C
Java
What many people code daily actually C one many Vulgates
Advocates language make various argument favor better large group programming These language say organize code library shareable reusable le likely cause pain suffering
These adaptation If going understand code work corporate environment need understand programming
There many definition
I wade provide face consequence
programming essence filing system code
As anyone ever shared networked organized physical filing without good shared filing system office implode
C people said great language
An excellent language
But really let organize thing
You end function
It mess
I mean data structure customer name address forth function manipulating data thing function related data except naming convention
C consistent way name thing
Which mean hard find later
programming gave programmer great way name mean building library
I could call run picture dog Internet address
That approach sloppy dangerous lead bug forebear reasoned without precedent make hard program big team keep track everything
So whaaaat made little box called Customer call class taxonomical sense like Customer subclass specie human subclass mammal etc
put data method relating customer box
And box literally anything inside relates particular class
I mean even need look inside box
You download large set class nested inside one another study available public method expected data start programming
Hey say let put data object take data
Every time new customer make new instance class
Code black box tentacle wire sticking need want inside box
You put couple box next touch tentacle together watch eldritch mating
This work well theory
The archetypal programming language Smalltalk created coterie genius Xerox PARC institution glorious glory day
After year gestation Smalltalk born year C gelled around
It inspired many big idea computer science also Platonism cell biology predecessor language called Simula first language per name designed simulate thing
While C created within New Jersey research facility Bell Labs industrial monolith AT T solve problem hand Smalltalk built California outpost different industrial monolith Xerox solve problem distant future
Thus Smalltalk represents world differently Smalltalk funny name friendly attitude specification ran page
It big system
C gave abstraction entire computer helping manage memory process inside machine
Smalltalk gave abstraction reality could start dividing world class method like
Where C tried make easier computer thing Smalltalk tried make easier human thing
This better worse
It different
Here Smalltalk code It print short sentence Transcript Window user screen
The Transcript receiving message Hello etc
You type select mouse even early tell computer execute
It compiles bit code add rest running system
It look like The thing box manipulated
They object
It almost powerful The boundary clear data code file executables operating system application closed open border fuzzed design
Smalltalk vision computer native medium
The whole system modified anyone
The dominant version called Squeak logo cute mouse modernized version called Pharo logo lighthouse
Both free easy download
As middling programmer I find Smalltalk environment fascinating never pull way looking glass
One day I promised I read skim intent huge Smalltalk specification seminal text grand attempt organize reality along computer principle
The problem Smalltalk requires one adopt method working also philosophy world everything organized hierarchy class
I love play I typically stumble back familiar approach
Being advocate Smalltalk little like Slovenian cinema free jazz
Some advocate particularly brilliant people
I one
Smalltalk history often described slightly tragic many best idea never permeated culture code
But still around still user anyone use Squeak Pharo
The number digital thing conceived still regular discussion quite small
It year Al Green
The world corrupts pure vision great idea
I pronounce Smalltalk raging wild global success
Python interesting language quite popular
It rigid
And widely understood easier C programmer use provides abstraction programmer reuse
It hide much weirdness computer many detail computation performed
Python usually slower C price pay sweet level abstraction
In vast majority case difference speed truly matter regardless much people protest
It consequence built system Python part run million billion time slowing thus requiring resource get work done
What
Does mean need throw away Python start language
Probably
Python deserved reputation glue language meaning take code language C Fortran yes year code close machine known sound write wrapper That embed older faster code newer slower system
A big part process wrapping old code nice Python function
In many way idiom language look also feel
Some language emphasize brevity
Some support long complex function others encourage break functionality small piece
Style usage matter sometimes programmer recommend Strunk White right one English language
Its focus efficient usage resonates programmer
The idiom language part communal identity
Python glue everything though
It hard connect Java fit C hand glove
There version Python designed run inside Java use Java code
That called Jython
If want version work Microsoft go IronPython
But another way interpret activity around Python People love want work everywhere everything
They spent ten thousand hour making possible given fruit labor away
That powerful indicator
A huge amount effort gone making Python practical well pleasurable use
There lot conference frequent code update vibrant mailing list
You pick language technical merit speediness job opportunity may present also culture
Python people generally pretty cool
There website dedicated language benchmark measuring fast certain language run compared others includes preface stave riot These compiler interpreter
These program could written
These task could solved
These tiny It sometimes appears everyone coding beef
You feel coming Web page
There lot defensive postscript added response outrage
People reacted strongly post read
I mean imply Java Languages agenda
People glom onto
Blunt talk seen good quality developer sign engineering mindset every opinion quickly possible sooner reach technical consensus
Expect told wrong expect tell people wrong
Masculine anger bluntly expressed part industry
Coding culture blurters
This yield fast decision penalizes people need quietly compose thought rewarding thinker harrumph efficiently
Programmer job interview often include abstract meaningless question must answered immediately whiteboard typify culture
Regular meeting become sniping match thing matter
The shorthand term Who care color bike shed painted
Well Code culture broad geographic cultural core Silicon Valley engine progress
The Valley mythologizes young genius vast sum
To credit culture work shame work everyone
At moment new thing could catch fire disrupt tribal ebb flow
Instagram written Python sold million Python moment glory
The next app could show written new start everyone taking seriously
Within month skill could quite valueless suspect
I meeting someone said How long take fix One person company year said Three A new person come world rapidly provisioned cloud microservices said Three They correct
That change enters world

It hard better life great programmer long unencumbered physical mental illness
Programming task reward intense focus done small group even isolation
It come association Asperger syndrome many programmer say somewhere spectrum though little obsessive seen good thing many coder
And job program successfully placed people autism spectrum programming career
But idea people Asperger make good programmer suspect idea woman naturally inclined coding assumption use term beloved Internet problematic deeply reductive
Tread lightly All kind people programmer
And autistic people kind career
If programmer exist require manager company
There shame
For truly gifted programmer writing code side effect thought
Their skill syntax perceive time computation
They see consequence action quickly next programmer spend le time dark
Their code still bug still need without flaw
But every candle three four flashlight map

An experienced talented programmer learn language week middling one going take much longer
Meanwhile exciting interesting programming language always come list benison promise speed productivity happiness
No really
Happiness serious selling point language people written blog post analyze people discus code
According PHP coder far likely use word hate Reddit comment Clojure programmer Clojure programmer far likely use word cool PHP programmer
There many blog post persuade manager switch new language
Experienced manager bear scar often coder become practiced squinting coughing saying thing like No switching cost high right Maybe could trial project build analytics reporting Then programmer shuffle back standing desk complain product shipped
Or else quit Lord know job
For programmer particularly young one job everywhere
Managers old coder fewer option
It often better keep working shipping even code start look ugly even nominally better solution even technical debt accrues around year everything change
Maybe get promoted new manager motive tear everything cursing start perhaps using new language goal making something much simpler
Or entire industry spasm everything done need thrown away rebuilt along new line anyway

Nine week asked TMitTB come office talk next step
You noticed team started dress like
One woman tall boot done something complex hair
She wearing black leather jacket
Nothing ostentatious cooler
She previously Patagonia
Is programmer dress
How get executive style
PHP say
The team good time PHP world
But I think thing might learned He pronounce bracket course approved expense write bracketed
It good good time cost send conference put hotel feed idea whether money well spent
really need move Oh
Well
There answer
We agreed PHP language next five Which one would say Ay rub say remind show real face right
If quote though Well ask language want use He look confused
I mean matter say
I write Then
And realize right answer one
One famous paper computing The Next Programming Languages
Landin talk language already cluttering computing landscape
It written academic journal wonderfully accurate opening statement Most programming language partly way expressing thing term thing partly basic set given It published
A language still u
Cobol example legendary extremely verbose language intimately linked year problem
As computer scientist Dijkstra described The use Cobol cripple mind teaching therefore regarded criminal While one sings praise except love Cobol still run mainframe
Fortran Formula Translating System John Backus LISP List Processor John McCarthy eventually lowercased Lisp UNIX became Unix developed day computer fed huge tape paper card still use today
The power granted Fortran inherent look almost comically computerish Much work come lazy
I like writing program I working IBM writing program computing missile trajectory I started work programming system make easier write Think That program wrote C page one print list square
You pick weird metallic smell large computer center raised floor looking Fortran
It excels numerical computing needed scientist still beat C task
Physicists astronomer like well live Fortran
Lisp though another kind beast
It emerged straight mathematical research
There many thing made Lisp peculiar
Some people say stand Lots superfluous Back Fortran programmer optimizing nuclear weapon yield Lisp programmer trying get robot pick teddy bear write sonnet
But one day people ran funding part world came yelled Shut pulled big red switch probably programmed Fortran
The Lisp programmer yet simulate human brain automatically produce great sonnet left regret
The Lisp machine company began shut sell asset
Students likely learn C Java
Lisp became cautionary tale unique unified vision computer fond memory better era
And yet There still quite bit Lisp world data system built ITA acquired Google
When Google flight nyc berlin ITA background running Lisp
There time Lisp looked deader ancient Greek beautiful philosophical system practical
Lisp blur line code data way allows function refer
It work little much ask regular programmer see world infinitely programmable
We need clarity
Which mean really need talk data
In interest understanding work open invitation TMitTB attend meeting programmer
Two late bravely ask one already attendance explain going
He quickly gather limit information series question beginning Do know Web page Here show To gather address name make Web page using HTML
Here change
And look like On today agenda How make sure registration positive experience user also secure experience company
The question discussed programmer tell along line Where put data
Will put text file
What
How act upon Enter remaining two programmer
Programmer A senior take place whiteboard
Let start Can define valid A via regular expression test
according RFC RFC
Let assume library OK
Do send everyone submits form confirmation message
We right
Is spec
No
Then
Well wait maybe update spec
It best practice
Can I say worry

We need check confirmation
Got
What really really worry temporary service right
Like allows give disposable address
So let anyone enter Mailinator address
Right one address
It like
So get list
There list actually
You go reload Mailinator page make list cross finger
Yeah looked
There list
Can rathole Mailinator talk overall security
I mean counting library validation good enough
No one going enter
Russians
Very possibly
But set upload limit right
Sort also allow people upload large image megabyte
So
No right
Those come lump someone could enter need check
I take want going relate overall database schema
Can catch database
That I take
Someone take picture whiteboard
Sure
And talk account expiration
Is spec
No dependency admin tool
Who owns
And go whiteboard whiteboard punctuated sound mobile phone fake camera shutter
Do need keep track many time How remove system What someone enters twice Programmer A leader seems professional
She whiteboard scribbling erasing scribbling erasing
Lists arrow box line
She wrote RUSSIANS
board
But hour realize This
One field
One little bit data
You even hit name yet
What user one name
What Bono Cher sign account
What Chinese Bono
Do want allow Chinese
What browser need support
Do call center people need able manage account
It hard think barrel cash burning
Programmer B entering thing tracking system creating issue assigning task people
A flurry assignment emerging meeting
Programmer C young annoying programmery others seem like well enough
How ensure credit card valid physical address real
Will perform financial transaction
Which external system integrate system
Who get sale report
We talk mailing list software
We talk password length number letter symbol necessary password secure whether password strategy site fit overall security profile company responsibility different division
So work
It go day
It get turned specification user story reviewed TMitTB right away conference tell overjoyed attended meeting
Not line code written throughout process
Data come everywhere
Sometimes come third import big pile music file record label
Sometimes data like tweet Facebook post Word document
Sometimes machine create data Fitbit exercise tracker Nest thermostat
When work coder talk data time
When create website need get data database put Web page
If Twitter tweet data
If IRS tax return data broken field
Data management problem programming supposed solve
But course computer everywhere keep generating data requires programming forth
It hell problem end sight
This people technology make much money
Not sell infinitely reproducible nothing sell many actually come new category infinitely reproducible nothing handle happened last batch
That ended big I conference packed
It rare large task ever far database
Amazon Google Yahoo Netflix huge powerful database
The prevalent relational database using language called SQL Structured Query Language
Relational database represent world using table row column
SQL look like Implying table called BOOKS row table book resides ID
IDs important database
Imagine bookstore database
It customer table list customer
It book table list book
And clever table purchase row every time customer bought book
Congratulations
You built Amazon
Of course trying build bookstore actually built death seems happen lot business
You set something cool end destroying lot thing came
Relational database showed never left
There Oracle course
Microsoft SQL Server IBM
They speak SQL work similar manner enough difference make costly switch
Oracle make pay thousand dollar use commercial enterprise database world run free software database PostgreSQL MySQL
There even tiny little database called SQLite small permissively licensed basically every smartphone available apps help save load data
You probably powerful database pocket right
If walk programmer say Big corporate programming think Java
Go popular coding job site search opening New York result Java recent search JavaScript Python Ruby
Only two Lisp
Java programming language born Sun Microsystems
product team led programmer named James Gosling
It also look lot like C people understood language fairly easy pick
It conceived eventually floating onto Internet massive cloud marketing proclaimed answer every woe ever beset programmer
Java ran every computer
Java would run right inside Web browser applet soon called crapplets would probably take Web time
Java
It ran slowly compared traditional language What
Java
They also computer terminal called JavaStations
Java
Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers even announced million Java fund
But excitement Java sort hung
The future look like Sun said would
Java running inside Web browser never worked well
It slow clunky loaded felt like teetering edge disaster paranoia frequently validated browser froze crashed
jewelry meant serve kind digital card also low success rate
But Java free download designed useful small large team alike
Here fact Java help understand slowly took world sheer power pretty good
It big language
It came ton code already class library class method need talk database deal complex document mathematics talk various network service
There ton class library waiting turned object brought life
It automatically generated documentation
This huge
Everyone say code deserves excellent documentation documentation truly matter principle mostly proven breach
Now could run tool called would make Web page listed class method
It lousy documentation better nothing pretty easy enhance took time clean code
There lot Java manual workshop training seminar certification
Programmers take class test officially certified many technology
Java programmer especially wide range choose
It ran virtual machine meant Java ran everywhere meant could run Windows Mac Unix machine would behave
It exceptionally compromise
Which made perfect big company
As kept going Java became popular application server
Creating content management system nongovernmental organization employee
Java fine
Connecting ten thousand people company one another
Java
Need help one bank talk another bank every day
Java
Charts diagram big stack paper project
Java
Not exciting hardly wearable predictable
A language building great big thing great big place great big team
People complain work
Of course Microsoft intolerable
You company creeping bank enterprise dumb language
You people choosing run stuff virtual machine running Windows machine God Bill Gates intended
Don ever count Microsoft
Its great corporate skill always take sheer weirdness computer idea translate corporation language Global Business Leadership
Whatever discussed issue Microsoft offer least one
Statically typed scripting ambiguous adjective Microsoft sell something delivers write Windows code live Windows life
And disparagement Microsoft product good better anything else market
Enterprise feared word among programmer enterprise programming lot work without much show
Remember first version total disaster
Perfect example enterprise coding
At time programmer respect big work
We respect ambition huge heavy machine running big blob code
We grew reading supercomputer
Big iron cool even future seems huge cloud platform hosting ton cheap computer
But Java also wide use Google
It language place General Electric Accenture
These startup product schedule slip revenue beholden public market
Gigantic organization structured around code around getting software made
But mean team example famous rule Never meeting two pizza feed entire These company culture know make software
They whole department dedicated testing
The process important many moving piece many invisible
Academic researcher often produce thing basically work interface
They need prove thesis publish move next thing
People free software community often code scratch itch release code digital common people modify manipulate
While often process go nowhere time project capture imagination others become part infrastructure world
Java interestingly profit
It designed big corporate project infrastructure support
It also useful language midsize task
So library need processing logging file appearing steady clip improving standard library supplanting entirely
Eventually people realized like Java language could write language compile Java bytecode run Java virtual machine JVM
So many language run top Java
Some version language Jython JRuby
Others totally new like Scala one language Twitter began use outgrew Ruby
There also Clojure Lisp
That Clojure take computer language born update give language ability reuse Java class world
Clojure created Rich Hickey decided wanted new modern version Lisp
Lisp may old language still revered classic model thought like Braun shaver Eames chair mind
Hickey worked Clojure many year eventually adapting run JVM
This dramatic choice meant Clojure access entirety Java class library
Now walk office sit computer write little code elegant trim comfortable access thousand thousand incredibly totally functional free library use get work done
Anything Java Clojure
And since built atop JVM computer
There already Lisp editing tool pretty easy modify Clojure
It joined Java like remora shark
Or accurately remora attached remora JVM fake machine running inside real machine
Clojure beloved widely used
Perhaps become popular
It show interesting place
It used Stores collect manage receipt data example
It ported world Microsoft run right inside Excel
It craziest thing
Take spreadsheet
Inside spreadsheet Clojure code running away addressing different cell column
Someone made version compiles well transpiles JavaScript blam Clojure running Web browser
Actually version called ClojureScript
The point thing fluid world programming fluid way industry seem
Languages liquid infrastructure
You download program whoa suddenly working Clojure environment
Which actually Java Runtime Environment
You grab old PC outlived usefulness put Linux suddenly powerful Web server
Now participate whole new culture
There meetups gathering conference blog people chatting Twitter
And welcomed
They glad new blood
Java supposed supplant C run smart jewelry
Now run application server host Lisplike language core language Android operating system
It run billion thing
It
C designed supplant also
A lot thing keep winning computer keep getting plentiful
It weird
A week later office meeting ask TMitTB way use component way buy way
He make face
Sort say making system integrate system around company set system nothing truly shelf
There tool package library wit already use free code thing validation obviates much
Everything edge case say
Testing edge You come conclusion The world broken
Remember Netscape first huge commercial Web browser
In Java blooming Netscape resolving problem
It displayed Web page lively
You could nice cartoon monkey Web page way make monkey dance moved mouse
Figuring make happen job language developer named Brendan Eich
He sat week created language called JavaScript
JavaScript relationship Java tenuous strongest bond language marketing linkage name
And early history JavaScript uninspiring
So monkey could dance
You could thing cursor make thing blink mouse touched
But browser proliferated Web grew platform platform JavaScript became arguably widely deployed language runtime world
If wrote JavaScript code could run wherever Web
JavaScript puttered around year wilderness Java
But without resolute support corporate entity like Sun
Then decade ago people began talk Ajax idea could build real software Web page document program could real work
Things could respond change according input
You could distribute software hundred million people way JavaScript would work
It controlled Java much slower natively compiled C terrible lack nicety
And yet Gmail Google Maps Flickr Twitter Facebook
Every single pixel Web page manipulated type changed word move around button pressed
As celebrity whole industry dedicated spackling deficiency making look good
There book good part JavaScript library make easier consistent program jQuery turn many line code necessary make paragraph disappear single
Back era iPod Macintoshes Apple took code Web browser called Konqueror modified create Safari Web browser compete Microsoft Internet Explorer
Then Google started make modification Web engine underneath Safari called Webkit made version called Chrome JavaScript engine called
They made JavaScript fast
Devs still approach performance JS code riding horse cart tweeted one developer horse long replaced fusion Google better JavaScript fast
In developer named Ryan Dahl modified engine free software made run outside browser
There freestanding version JavaScript including ran inside Java natch none fast
He called fork took
One day JavaScript ran inside Web page
Then broke browser prison
Now could operate anywhere
It could touch hard drive send erase file
It real programming language
And client become server
Here JavaScript squaring number In great sudden wave thousand developer began use create modular library
If knew JavaScript worked Web page could make work server
And interesting characteristic language made good writing software handle lot simultaneous user
JavaScript listened lot thing Web browser A mouse move key typed information come network
On server could listen dozen hundred people give information requested
Soon community developed huge library software specific thing reading file chattering database talking Amazon Web service tool
At writing package billion copy various package downloaded past month
NPM stand Node Package Manager
It software help install package well unwieldy honestly many package great
It lot searching testing sighing
But much stuff pick free complain
JavaScript hodgepodge designed hurry run well know let say device might well get program
Your customer may iPhones probably way running JavaScript
So might use JavaScript make interesting Web page
You might use make application like Google Docs run browser
You might use make Web server talk Web browser
Or might use make API serf data client sure client could laptop Web browser
But client quite probably app smartphone
You get site running PHP minute problem
It used terrible choice made needed get something done Web increasingly JavaScript replaced default terrible choice
PHP stand Personal Home Interpreter
The idea loaded Web page PHP code would run page went Internet
And PHP could say check whether logged
If could show top secret account detail could say Please log I know lot people program PHP smart good people
PHP power Etsy Facebook
It power Wikipedia God sake
WordPress
Out Web page enormous percentage created PHP
Coding PHP living death sentence
Lots people gotten rich PHP
It mean lot cutting pasting lot trip Google figure thing working
Poor sad misbegotten incredibly effective massively successful PHP
Reading PHP code like reading poetry poetry wrote freshman year college
I spent many hundred maybe thousand hour programming PHP back I know I neither PHP
Reloading Web page finger sore
I hear sympathetic sob
Everything always broken people always hacking site
PHP
I wish harm
I glad see well done
We good time together
I ever want go back
One privilege owning Mac download program Apple called Xcode
This IDE Integrated Development Environment
It enormous download gigabyte roughly size hour video
Xcode heart Apple
It company writes software tool everyone want write software Mac iPhone
Within Xcode whole world explore
For example one component iOS SDK Software Development Kit
You use make iPhone iPad apps
That SDK made dozen dozen APIs Application Programming Interfaces
There API keeping track user location one animating picture one playing sound several rendering text screen collecting information user
And forth
Maybe starting see strand
Remember way Smalltalk environment worked screen bunch window
There powerful echo Xcode
There way tend code text editor black background far le see first glance though actually right serious code life
You fill field wire thing together really sometimes done connecting virtual wire virtual hole start coding
When someone Apple stand onstage announces new thing end Kit ResearchKit WatchKit set routine specifically Apple kit land fully documented used make software

You know Apple touting track someone heartbeat using Apple Watch
Apple documented yet world
Maybe company worried misuse somehow
Perhaps heartbeat monitoring requires careful battery management watch already battery issue Apple want avoid making thing worse letting anyone
It likely people trying figure access heartbeat API right though
That way people
Apple really good
It publishes interface guideline give people tool arranging app interface predictable way end user find familiar
It set flow go

You also know length song mean need mechanism extracting duration music file
Once need divide get minute
But song podcast minute long
Do want divide get hour
So many variable
Gah
I guess problem solve
The IDE everything
The greatest commercial insight technology industry control computing environment move market
You change way people thing way listen music watch video respond advertising
People work technology company supposed take idea multiply million people yielding billion dollar
A great way wrap intention APIs SDKs IDEs
That much software make software free It stimulates development even software
Sometimes result corporate ambition Java much Sun product class library true C Microsoft
But much code world freely available created generous volunteer decade serve need
The corporation programming language complex
Some language developer hired work language Go Python funded varying degree Google creator PHP work Etsy
Most commonly used button Usually list grid Used filtering Mac Finder Mail Designed toolbars Usage mystery Used toggle button New style push button indicator Apple Microsoft Amazon Google factory factory
Their APIs product many thousand hour labor many programmer
Think work involved
Someone need manage SDK
Hundreds programmer need write code
People need write documentation organize demo
Someone need fight feature get funded finished
Someone need make sure translation German completed embarrassing mistake go viral Twitter
Someone need actually write software go making IDE work
The modern OS feast wonder fast video music player bucket button
Apple may best imaginary button maker history
Just bezel work behold

In Xcode compile everything one command pop software testing
You see button made
You need click
It yearns click
It cry shrill signaling voice like nano cat microfence
Everything inside computer beseeches everything else

Loops upon loop feeding one another capital accruing coffer patient software giant
An ecosystem
Ecosystem another debased word especially given keep real physical one around u
But hundred thousand people raising kid making thing million people call
Odds kind programming especially Web programming adopted framework
Whereas SDK expression corporate philosophy framework like product pitch
Want save time
Tired writing old code
Curious next new thing
You use graphic framework build graphical application Web framework build Web application network framework build network server
There hundred framework every language one
Django Reinhardt guitar virtuoso namesake Django framework A popular Web framework Django used coding Python
Instagram bootstrapped
When sit first time Django run command make directory file configuration inside
This project directory
Now access library service add enhance library
Suppose still making bookstore Amazonesque one relational database started page back
With Django run command
You might tell start app called bookstore
Then set model meaning start define data look using Python idiom framework translate
So make book catalog
Obviously need add author like
The incredibly neat thing line configuration completely functional working article editor wit That called admin view always main feature Django
Your work programmer started soon moment conception building publishing platform alpha tester maybe testing frame start play baby entering book trying thing
Take moment
You learn programming language like Python
You need make website allows dozen people enter data
You write line Python code set account people using admin start enter data
If time get good sort work
You get team started project hour
Remember issue entering address
If use Django use many taken care
Ditto many security concern arise building website typical abuse people perpetrate
You entered pool many thousand programmer share framework use suggest improvement write tutorial write used accomplish task related password blogging managing spam providing calendar accelerating site creating discussion forum integrating service
You think term architecture
Magnificent
Wonderful
So downside
Well framework lock way thinking
You look website trained eye go Oh Ruby Rails Frameworks obvious influence kind work developer
Some people feel framework make thing easy become crutch
It pretty easy code hole find trying force framework something want
Django example right tool building giant chat application would want try competing Google Docs using Django backend
You pay price speed control convenience
The problem really knowing much speed control convenience need
Programmers talk premature optimization code know real problem describe people overthink programming architecture There another tendency NIH invented come lot
Frameworks feel little insulting anticipate problem used thousand people
They imply common everyday problem rather special amazing mystery require true genius solve
The opinion framework strong strong SDK
Those tightly bundled often commercial arrive PR trumpet blasting especially Apple Microsoft
Frameworks tend derived frustration first release bound tape thrust onto Web blog post

There Web application framework every major language show almost different framework Java alone almost PHP
Most good framework free released solve problem bring glory influence creator rather great rich control
They spread organically
People see video tutorial showing make blog minute
Then copy work say That easy show friend
Websites go live programmer talk quickly developed said website
If building Web app fool use Web framework first
There tiny one control freak focused URL routing massive one like Django Rails pursue goal first outlined large system Smalltalk day yore enable development large collaborative system data manipulated shared
Take work done
DRY repeat
In programming many way destroy something create something
One stray character required
Say forget semicolon use accented é somewhere code prepared
Or add two thing together one numeral string might use say blackbird baked To computer numeric significance
This sort thing really happens part job remembering
Programming debugging
It expectation thing work
This something people bring like bring medical history first date
Most language construct built catching failure trapping like wild animal examining well exterminating
In time relationship programming language blossom come realize truly characterizes language tell broke
Most programming life spent trying figure broke computer help maybe watch kid play soccer
When I started programming I felt time program crashed I failed
I found cringing desperate unable move forward
There even novel Ellen Ullman anxiety social complexity arise serious bug hard find
Eventually though I learned submit
I let drift computer remember math I know thing I understand type category list syntax
Sometimes bug cause error message pop sometimes cause program give ghost quit suddenly sometimes get caught terrible loop fill memory choke resource computer restarted
That called stack overflow
Sometimes request go hard example calling many time stack finite resource fill take anymore
Hence name website Stack Overflow programmer go answer question help solve bug
It website world trailing Craigslist spot
Randomly selected item Stack Overflow give taste programming Angular embedding nested
view working TheOncomingCode seems saying using AngularJS framework JavaScript another piece code called
Judging name latter help set route address component user help manage view data
But wait turn actually Oh man
I went looked tool describes Yeoman generator modular AngularJS apps Gulp optional Polymer support I mean come hell
But know
In pound
Let
A search Yeoman say scaffolding tool mean make little folder Web apps help get started programming
Useful
We know Angular framework
Gulp website say automate enhance You intuit using context clue tool help build software
Somehow
You never know salmon background site sometimes simply get tired
Polymer Web component library mean give little reusable code component use Web drawer menu button etc
OK
So know combination Angular Yeoman Gulp Polymer somehow working TheOncomingCode
All thing tool designed make easier code
But introduce complexity
This person trying make Web browser something JavaScript crapping
Someone came answer question
To able use header state home state wrote Stack Overflow user Matt Tester need nested chained
So obvious safely make one state parent another separate way registration So
There go
That solves
JavaScript right
Too much know today useless six month
Every factoid absolute best principled way use language fetid zoo garbage end year
And sniveling bearded looking slightly right pale eye awkwardly mumbling Yeah wow say lot Gulp Angular I guessing use Fleejob Grimmex Snurt extension

I sure gon na like working Anyway one question Stack Overflow
More month go
Nothing built
The old website remains showing age infuriating everyone
Pressure mount
Pressure
The failed
The new CTO charlatan
TMitTB apparently spent time conference time actually working
These thing spoken loud kind company
Things said eye roll shrug hallway ordering address via BCC
You let antenna work
You hear word boondoggle late phrase like operationally There lot compliance governance
Earlier career might panicked
Instead feel sense calm
You call CTO TMitTB office soon back vicinity
They come looking sheepish
The CTO braced shoulder firm
TMitTB oscillates sheepish angry
People believe say pointing upward time cut loss shut If hover near programmer hear talk writing test passing test
Some even program written test code hope write must pas
This called design
Tests code course
They check function code
They run hope automatically find day work break thing
Relentless testing one way keep eye make sure person bug bug find one wintry night everyone home fireplace crash server right Christmas setting kind automated alarm forcing programmer terrible apology loop deeply annoyed spouse
One piece code world called SQLite database mentioned earlier probably smartphone
It developed Richard Hipp working year
It totally open totally free test
It one widely used piece software one respected
Bugs original sin programming
They part life like unwanted body hair political campaign
The original sin programming people code new feature trying jam change main codebase ready
Automated testing way head bug also way suggest write respectable code code earns salute
In opinion version control one beautiful thing programming
It one code culture gift world
Version control like track change Microsoft Word
That shameful monstrosity make even powerful computer stutter something lawyer could love
No version control something different
What I told Go could record every change made many many document go codebase Well interesting
I mean I could use kind thing
I could use find bug entered system example
record made minute permanent record Well powerful
I could use review progress team making I manager looking change every day
every change could reviewed anyone totally transparent way Everyone keep change understand code evolving
Every change
bundle change turn branch anyone make many branch needed without violating integrity branch I say sound like insane fantasy
Someone completely change code without interfering work others
could merge finished branch back main trunk code reviewing fixing inconsistency go My God like hear inside brain
So even though code huge pile fragile interdependent component I code team working branch I spent time solid testing suite appropriate time merge change run automated test make sure everything still working
everyone history every change ever made code even codebase decade old
Shut shut take everything disembodied code voice take everything
Take
completely totally free download default way distributing source code throughout world
And everyone get excited GitHub
You go GitHub really
You poke around look thousand repository read README file
And look code look commits
A commit moment action captured stored
You compare one commit another see diff see added removed
See figure
Take look screen shot
First looking Django repository
This actual code make Django Web framework run
It people keeping eye people starred favorite people copied code repository intention manipulating adding changing
These number represent invested user
There likely hundred thousand downloaded code use
We see user claudep
He five hour ago adding commit message read Fixed filename max He working file called mean particular new code marked green prefixed beginning line probably either test code code support test
And thanks user claudep code better six hour ago
This experience using version control
It combination news feed backup system
GitHub invent version control
It took program called git developed first Linus Torvalds chief architect Linux started adding tool service around
The way git work copy code change ever made code one command That copy code local machine
Now go change code heart delight
When done changing type add file changed asks enter commit message explaining done cause error think come start pushing code node repository
But permission would push change master branch git repository hosted GitHub
These command part sense memory many programmer
They type variation dozen time day checking code keep record work done rewind point go deep screw many thing
Sometimes change pile point look say This good
We ready release new code Maybe every two week maybe year
Maybe like Facebook time
If software Version could bundle change tag code
Behold Version
A change come second later coder far away matter Version
You done Version
Version part permanent record
You might fix bug call Version
You might add another feature call Version
Tools git give programmer common language
Did check ask
Which commit That going pushed Because commit get unique identifier pinpoint commit space time feel confident record code change way rarely feel confident anything
A side effect confidence increased automation
Let say Web server program popular serf hundred million people every month
It run different computer cloud
Aren something
Your diligent decentralized team frequently writes new code run server
So problem What best way get code onto computer
Click drag mouse
God
What animal
You set continuous integration server install let robot serve
Programmers hardly talk code
They chat data
They chat requirement interesting approach
And chat constantly deployment
Which make sense goal code brain testing world Web app form
Programmers good one want ship move next problem
So lot policy ton deploying fresh code
For example See test version control trigger actually shipping code
If follow process like release software several time day software would folly
Often build done nightly big build server one would come next morning get score
But software released via Web app store wait
Why continually release software every day whenever something ready go
I mean company everything imaginable slow shipping TMitTB say CTO wince
That fine expected stressful meeting
First I needed pas everything security team five month review TMitTB say took week get working development environment I developer sneaking Starbucks check code
You listen way listened people criticize project
But people promised new exciting way working would cut problem experienced failed technology initiative yore
They would agile would use new tool would attract talent would ship code
They knew big company startup signed
And casual observer failure
TMitTB noticed gained weight
The CTO several project roughly footing scattered across organization lost weight
I told I could I right TMitTB say
So need done month He sits back chair shallow visitor chair lightly padded back intended dramatic effect diminished
One lesson TMitTB tried get across big message matter code never done shipping new platform longer website platform interlocking component team continue work forever
There always new bug new feature new need
Such thing side effect growth platform insists designed scale
What one engineering understand perceive static exhausting enemy corporate world surround world static
yes battleship leave port
What coder seeing come believe staid enterprise world fear consequence apathy rather détente
They see stability
Where see obstacle intransigence see huge complex dynamic system flow river money people deeply afraid move anything would dam river
You feel pity coder
Obviously inherit earth
But race summit missed lot memo
I want ship TMitTB say
By mean I want I asked But much company hears I want destroy everything I touch
For I Kali destroyer best OK say
I understand
Here going You look CTO nod
First His mouth open shuts
He afraid realize understand work see software thing golden braid forever weaving
But coming around
Finding way programmer meeting
It like smartphone constant update
Nothing ever done
That fine
You let help optic continue
I need every day walking hall big smile face
Giving
Looking sleepy
Second I need release date real Next The CTO say name shake head
We work say
For conference
And talk sprint
Don talk milestone release
Talk people platform exists working month
Ask updated product The time
The CTO asks TMitTB We clear Yes TMitTB say
He fact ask question indicates might learning
He done lot work time get corporate pretend work
And pick language ask
This
We TMitTB say
We using
With Express Great say
Can wait see Beware argument related programming speed
All thing equal faster better
But thing never equal
Do need kind speed let get website running quickly
Or kind allows rotate thousand polygon real time
Do need convert PDFs text per hour
Or million PDFs text
These different problem
What need many time need existing code use help u many time
Ask question
It possible spend productive month preparing project without deciding language
It may sign fine manager someone assumes people learn new thing someone built agile team capable experimenting new technology getting idea production
It could also person totally useless
You find
Let say programmer developing huge website serf million people visit five time month
Do use Python slower Go fast something
Trick question
million Web page visit big deal unless involve deep wizardry complex database query different page good example Facebook
Now number trivial take minute make page need year make many way slow
If take second make page still million second month
So need figure serve page per second
You probably want one computer little redundancy good server setup
It take planning
But done language
What going serve hundred thousand page month
Then got tremendous breathing room
You need many engineer create system architecture
You still need plan general read blog post follow along others done
You pretty sloppy honest
Again language
What want include live chat page expect thousand people use chat speaking
Now dipping hand godforsaken river
But exactly problem Go designed solve
It language creating highly available server use much computer processor possible
It feature well Go shine
Actually work pretty well sort server Clojure certainly capacity
Oh right Java work
If really needed could even PHP
This choice hard
Everything everything people tell use everything everything
So need figure kind team kind framework like using people productive stick around completion project
This hard
Most place
So go lowest common know people leave able get
And OK
The vast majority technology project require original research require amazing technological discovery
All language discussion work fine
There great coder
But choice main programming language important signaling behavior technology company engage
Tell program Java I believe either serious boring
In Ruby interested building thing quickly
In Clojure I think smart wonder ship
In Python I trust implicitly
In PHP sigh together
In C I nod humbly
In C I smile assume nothing common
In Fortran I ask see security clearance
These language contain entire civilization
You tell well code organized across room
Or squinting zooming
The shape code foot away incredibly informative
Clean code idiomatic brief possible obvious even heavily documented
Colloquial friendly
As written aka SICP seminal textbook programming taught year MIT A computer language way getting computer perform operation novel formal medium expressing idea methodology
Thus program must written people read incidentally machine A great program letter current future person inherits code
A generous humanistic document
Of course nice flowery need work
One day go pen keep programmer
Their standup start hold cup coffee
They actually stand
Mostly men woman
They go around room person say yesterday plan today blocker
Most people office standup person people traveling chat
Two people dialed new hire Boston Hungary strong accent
They tell story rest
Yesterday I worked account deletion user story Boston say
Number
Today I writing unit test account deletion code
I blocked
I nominate Istvan go The line unmutes thick Hungarian accent say Yes yesterday I worked catalog admin tool product upload
I completed image upload feature
Today I also write unit test
I TMitTB say Istvan update JIRA JIRA commercial service function official record project
It strange hear thing approve line item discussed real actual thing
But also pleasing
On Wikipedia page list link page TDD BDD FDD DDD MDD development development design Each one advocate critic
I include amusement
If want go deeper management methodology
The management programmer discipline unto
There subdisciplines deal coder communicate
The prominent Agile methodology call regular coordination among programmer providing set ritual norm follow make program work program others
The yep manifesto read follows There signatory
And many variation Agile
I terrible meeting life I sat two team one explained length Agile Kanban better Agile Scrum
You could smell money burning
Here Agile I seen done You break product set user story need
You file story system often commercial product JIRA
You divide work sprint week two week whatever suit management style give sprint name goal implement search user registration programmer take story go make happen
Every day team check try unblock one working tool sends server working tell everyone
Then someone else step help stick story best everyone need working toward sprint goal trying release software
And sprint done deliver something actually really work move next thing slowly bringing large complex system operation
That ideal case
Done well avoids magical thinking It work get everything done wired together
It critic seem many branch
Scrum Kanban Agile Discipline Protestantism
Programmers forever searching silver bullet worse always think found
Which Frederick Brooks famous early software methodologists wrote paper called No Silver Accident Software He wrote
He hopeful back programming would help fix thing
Into office come TMitTB
He hold large bottle sort laptop look sleepy
You tell smile
We got release say
Ran little last He open laptop brings secret website assures seen within confines office network via virtual private network
It plain homely thing new website
Squares bumping square
The catalog item catalog screen image
The text sort weird character strange bug
There product name fake product real product I hate There related item purchase even though critical feature one major revenue driver current site
You suppress question
It
There however way log username password
TMitTB done favor creating account
You say first nonengineering person test site
This real ask
Yes
This software
It speaks database
This Does speak customer service He squint second
In July say
My God date
You extracted month something positively
He asked
He managed outward began gum work familiar way
He started demanding document people immediately began providing
He asked relative stranger insight suggestion gave willingly
They asked logo bigger
They asked game could played inside app
He listened
He conference month
So real actual Yes say taking sip complicated fermented beverage label
A sticker bottle say Now next sprint say
We push July
And release He look tired man
But also look proud
The thing team put used good modern tool
That craft pleasure TMitTB made possible work
We finally say going They standups
And standups go work integrated development environment write JavaScript JavaScript
Then run test check code source code repository continuous integration server perform test check go well deploy even August cloud another
They insist every day continuous release
Then come report
Revenue report analytics list new market conquer manner new customer data parcel distribute
That role owner global database customer intent
Thousands million new fact help company plan sale product development cycle
A good thing
And hope new site generate revenue faster better deployed across platform Web mobile Web multiple apps
You decided cut BlackBerry support
It stung three BlackBerrys desk drawer home none pocket
Life move
When site introduced buy coder cake send JavaScript conference choice
You learned appropriate reward people write JavaScript JavaScript
TMitTB get bonus
The CTO already considering new thing
You like CTO
She become friend sort
You feel S distance coming toward
It arrive due time stick front VP title well
The coder smile hall sat code review feature discussion stood quietly middle standups
You know name even could better job pronouncing
Perhaps future software
I spoke friend spent career technology
I complaining
I said I mentor millennials God
Every job contract position
Nothing come health care
They carry much They looked perplexity
It took moment one said Not You probably already code
You Excel Google Spreadsheets
You run little process sequence series routine big document
Programming career lead rewarding solidly existence
If inclined enjoy work good way spend time work good people dry part something teach
Of course true place smart people work
If situation lousy probably find another job easily say writer
The industry twist turn often though know next year bring
The iPhone mobile general created brief renaissance people could program using language people could worry computer memory
Perhaps Internet Things turn everything sensor
Already wander Disney World wristband watch track whole place computer
This require yet thinking
And website make apps build
There likely work
But global industry thousand people India great degree
Some used work Microsoft Google IBM
The thing made programming massive ship nothing charge perfect globalized industry
There simply reason aside prejudice think Mumbai Seoul make big complex thing well Palo Alto Seattle
You might learn program new economy irrational weird painful old one
Books song row database whole film made CPUs without real ray light penetrating lens
Maybe learning code give decoder ring future

But messenger blameless either
Aside serious fever occasional trip wood I used computer every day year
I learn world software
I learned publishing using desktop publishing system QuarkXPress I learned color art using program called Deluxe Paint
Software taught math basic statistic
It taught calculate great circle distance estimating distance two point globe
I learned Internet creating Web page I learned music MIDI
And software taught software
I like cheap old computer new one laptop creak open
My house filled book soft nondigital thing
But first thought I accomplish personal professional task What code I use
What software teach I need know
When I want learn something software exists vacuum bug someone

Compilation one denser subject computer science lower go opportunity deep weird thing speed code faster cheaper better
You write elegant code like Scott Fitzgerald computer compile Ernest Hemingway
But compiler often several pass turning code simpler code simpler code still Fitzgerald Hemingway Stephen King Stephenie Meyer way Dan Brown phase getting le readable repetitive go
I find code printed page hard read

PDF direct descendant PostScript PDFs everywhere
In code life idea grow inside language spread
Two plus two usually equal four language like JavaScript add answer
That number interpreted floating point point period JavaScript language us particular way representing number memory sometimes entirely predictable rounding error
This one thing know committed Web programmer
Well might said
It attributed might folklore
Nonetheless great quote
Meaning company huge use much prepackaged code rest u rather need rebuild thing tight specification
By way earlier assertion single fit barrel
It come calculation made Wolfram Alpha search engine work well quantity
The search US dry US dollar banknote result
User story often written paper card arranged wall also computerized card moved around mouse assigned programmer
Programmers spend much time dealing different type data
Let say I number x like word like When I multiply x result
A runtime error many multiply number word
The language Perl return zero expedient baffling JavaScript return NaN I know I know
How often going multiplying seven cat
Soooo much
The real world data messy constantly converting one type thing another shading subtle
Sometimes address bunch letter symbol sometimes field plucked database sometimes specially prepared sent Internet
Programmers write lot code convert data one type another
Some language incredibly vigilant type done data given type
They push hard programmer nail data type payoff language identify problem compile time instead later program running
A statically typed language like Java catch multiply poem try find geographic distance Chicago Social Security number
Other language far caveat programmer
A kernel lowest level operating system
The Linux kernel like engine car dashboard windshield tire seat come variety source
The Free Software Foundation asks call honor root people follow suggestion
Most people call Linux though refer one Linux distribution Red Hat Enterprise Linux Ubuntu Server It worth noting Linux hardly Unix OpenBSD FreeBSD Solaris AIX get drift
The chart showing Unices large chart
If old enough remember DOS know command line
Disclosure I written line C code life though I read lot language worked many tutorial
As Web person I kind system work excels
If work large software hardware company far likely find use
imperative functional paradigm language like Python referred Writing article nightmare I know matter many people review I missed something thread reader pull say He missed essence I know ashamed advocate
I accept
I know I describe compilation tiny strand subject I know way I characterize programming language reductive
This supposed brief article became brief book
So apology anything absolutely
They gave one magazine

The odd smell laser toner massive pile pulpy striped paper
Occasionally I see picture pile old machine olfactory memory jump
Lisp language programmer venerate rich history fact simplicity make possible Lisp program described programmable programming If ever bright programmer need challenge send learn Lisp
Some may return insufferable evangelist likely come back smarter flexible
Enjoying Lisp programming like enjoying prog rock expressionist art probably love bad square hate parenthesis
Remember computer memory kind like straight line programmer think tree
That Lisp nutshell give incredibly consistent way think tree
It close Zen computing get
Of language essay Lisp one I take desert island
It teach hidden order universe
HyperText Markup Language encoding format Web page since Web began
Programmers argue whether HTML programming paranoid status want allow mere claim blessed programmer status
So text appears count code The difference expert markup person expert coder experience somewhere favor programmer
When people talk database often use acronym CRUD create read update delete
You might create book customer purchase read data user log load name information update someone address delete user upon request
A huge amount code managing CRUD operation
Other language Perl PHP let exact thing Java run originally designed scripting quick evaluation program
They quite muscle
It matter say one thing powerful another invite fight someone show digital doorway say Actually night ruined
But I came said I need build platform month one going fire choosing Java
If I said I need prototype new platform next two month client may may decide build one look beautiful Web browser I might use something little smaller quite enterprisey
Python would good bet
Ruby would also fine
I really really like Clojure
It taught ton
But applies Clojure applies language
Oracle none pleased Google
The runtime something like JavaScript little like kernel operating system
It set service run JavaScript run available JavaScript code
You start runtime rest code run within context provides
In case context Web Ajax short Asynchronous JavaScript It refers set technology combined turned Web page software
After Ajax became much Web transformed publishing platform platform result Internet industry transformed current form
People complain
Application Programming big hairy set class object
There also Web APIs big hairy set class object retrieve using Web
A language way perceiving world
A standard library way organizing world
And IDE way bringing thing together lively dynamic way
In way Microsoft make tool available called Visual Studio us write software

I really like Django
It written kind people help people publishing
Ruby Rails probably famous Web framework course
It great
Comparison Web application framework solid Wikipedia page
In fact Wikipedia essential programming tool
The summary language approach typically full code sample
What name basically mean jerk

First Linux Actually programmer always talk much chat online often using Slack
Slack Internet startup provides chat service organized around need geographically diverse group
A large part appeal simplicity ease integrates product
Chat channel quickly come represent work going inside company set stream text searched
Slack provides institutional memory made lot nerd happy
It growing quickly
Slack investor recently valued billion time issue published probably worth planet earth

Life cycle model phenomenon life science
Industries experience similar cycle life
Just person born grows matures eventually experience decline ultimately death industry product line
The stage industry yet every industry experience stage differently last longer pas quickly others
Even within industry various firm may different life cycle stage
A firm strategic plan likely greatly influenced stage life cycle firm find
Some company even industry find new us declining product thus extending life cycle
The growth industry sale time used chart life cycle
The distinct stage industry life cycle introduction growth maturity decline
Sales typically begin slowly introduction phase take rapidly growth phase
After leveling maturity sale begin gradual decline
In contrast profit generally continue increase throughout life cycle company industry take advantage expertise economy scale scope reduce unit cost time
In introduction stage life cycle industry infancy
Perhaps new unique product offering developed patented thus beginning new industry
Some analyst even add embryonic stage introduction
At introduction stage firm may alone industry
It may small entrepreneurial company proven company used research development fund expertise develop something new
Marketing refers new product offering new industry question mark success product life industry unproven unknown
A firm use focused strategy stage stress uniqueness new product service small group customer
These customer typically referred marketing literature innovator early adopter
Marketing tactic stage intended explain product us consumer thus create awareness product industry
According research Hitt Ireland Hoskisson firm establish niche dominance within industry phase
For example often attempt establish early perception product quality technological superiority advantageous relationship vendor within supply chain develop competitive advantage
Because cost money create new product offering develop test prototype market product firm industry profit usually negative stage
Any profit generated typically reinvested company solidify position help fund continued growth
Introduction requires significant cash outlay continue promote differentiate offering expand production flow job shop possibly batch flow
Market demand grow introduction life cycle curve experience growth increasing rate industry said entering growth stage
Firms may also cluster together close proximity early stage industry life cycle access key material technological expertise case Silicon Valley computer chip manufacturer
Like introduction stage growth stage also requires significant amount capital
The goal marketing effort stage differentiate firm offering competitor within industry
Thus growth stage requires fund launch newly focused marketing campaign well fund continued investment property plant equipment facilitate growth required market demand
However industry experiencing product standardization stage may encourage economy scale facilitate development layout production efficiency
Research development fund needed make change product service better reflect customer need suggestion
In stage firm successful market growing demand create sale growth
Earnings accompanying asset also grow profit positive firm
Marketing often refers product growth stage star
These product high growth market share
The key issue stage market rivalry
Because acceptance product new entrant join industry intense competition result
The duration growth stage stage depends particular industry product line study
Some fad clothing experience short growth stage move almost immediately next stage maturity decline
A hot toy holiday season may nonexistent relegated back shelf following year
Because many new product introduction fail growth stage may short nonexistent product
However product growth stage may longer due frequent product upgrade enhancement forestall movement maturity
The computer industry today example industry long growth stage due upgrade hardware service product feature
During growth stage life cycle curve steep indicating fast growth
Firms tend spread geographically stage life cycle continue disperse maturity decline stage
As example automobile industry United States initially concentrated Detroit area surrounding city
Today industry matured automobile manufacturer spread throughout country internationally
As industry approach maturity industry life cycle curve becomes noticeably flatter indicating slowing growth
Some expert labeled additional stage called expansion growth maturity
While sale expanding earnings growing cash cow product rate slowed growth stage
In fact rate sale expansion typically equal growth rate economy
Some competition late entrant apparent new entrant try steal market share existing product
Thus marketing effort must remain strong must stress unique feature product firm continue differentiate firm offering industry competitor
Firms may compete quality separate product offering conversely firm may try strategy increase volume sale make profit inventory turnover
A firm stage may excess cash pay dividend shareholder
But mature industry usually fewer firm survive larger dominant
While innovation continue radical may change color formulation stress new improved consumer
Laundry detergent example mature product
Declines almost inevitable industry
If product innovation kept pace competing product service new innovation technological change caused industry become obsolete sale suffer life cycle experience decline
In phase sale decreasing accelerating rate
This often accompanied another larger industry competitor leave maturity stage exit industry
Yet firm remain compete smaller market
Mergers consolidation also norm firm try strategy continue competitive grow acquisition diversification
Management efficiency help prolong maturity stage life cycle
Production improvement like method lean manufacturing result extra profit
Technology automation linking supplier customer tight supply chain also method improve efficiency
New us product also revitalize old brand
A prime example Arm Hammer baking soda
In sale dropping due introduction packaged food baking soda added ingredient overall decline home baking
New us product deodorizer refrigerator later laundry additive toothpaste additive carpet freshener extended life cycle baking soda industry
Promoting new us old brand increase sale increasing usage frequency
In case strategy cheaper trying convert new user mature market
To extend growth phase well industry profit firm approaching maturity pursue expansion country new market
Expansion another geographic region effective response declining demand
Because organization control internal factor often influence external factor life cycle end
An example feminine hygiene product
Sales United States reached maturity due number external reason like stable declining population growth rate aging baby boomer may longer consumer product
But maker product concentrated foreign market sale grew maturity product prolonged
Often dog product find new life part world
However world saturation reached eventual maturity decline industry product line result
Just industry experience life cycle study documented life cycle many area
Countries life cycle example traditionally classify ranging First World country Third World developing country depending level capital technological change infrastructure stability
Products also experience life cycle
Even within industry various individual company may different life cycle stage depending upon entered industry
The life cycle phenomenon important universally accepted concept help manager better understand sale growth change time

Manufacturing product complex
Raw material come many different source obtaining one material involves different series input output process impact environment
To identify total environmental impact product necessary life cycle analysis
To examine much product impact environment necessary account input output throughout life cycle product birth including design raw material extraction material production part production assembly use final disposal
The first stage life cycle analysis called inventory In inventory analysis goal examine input output product life cycle beginning product composed material came go input output related component material lifetime
It also necessary include input output product use whether product us electricity
The purpose inventory analysis quantify come go including energy material associated material extraction product manufacture assembly distribution use disposal environmental emission result
The next stage life cycle analysis impact analysis environmental impact identified previous stage enumerated environmental impact generating energy process hazardous waste emitted manufacturing process
Once environmental impact input output product lifecycle analyzed life cycle analysis generates number represents much environment affected
However major purpose analysis evaluate input output quantified product affect environment throughout lifecycle
Once general environmental impact calculated next step conduct improvement analysis see impact product environment
For example conservation energy water manufacturing process reduce environmental impact process
Substituting le hazardous chemical place toxic one would also reduce impact
The change made inventory analysis recalculate total environmental impact
Environmental health safety consultant Thomas Gloria compiled excellent list life cycle analysis link including list life cycle analysis software tool
Want know much metal used energy produced toxics transferred production car
This Carnegie Mellon Green Design Initiative calculator estimate overall environmental impact production various commodity service
In November article Beverly Hassell chemist American Chemical Society describes finding study published estimate environmental impact producing microchip
In analysis microchip scientist found amount fossil fuel chemical input necessary production significant negative impact air water soil

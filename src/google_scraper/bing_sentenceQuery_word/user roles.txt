Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Updated December Applies To System Center Service Manager At company employee responsible supporting hardware portable computer server
Some employee allowed create update Configuration Items CI delete whereas others allowed create update delete CIs
In Service Manager security right allow user access update information defined user role profile
A user role profile named collection access right usually corresponds business responsibility
Each user role profile control access artifact knowledge article work item incident change request authoring administration credential
Think user role profile defining allowed
In future manager company may decide separate group employee maintain CIs two group handle CIs desktop computer handle CIs portable computer
They want retain two user role profile one create edit delete CIs another create edit delete CIs
You would define user role profile different scope one desktop one portable computer
If user role profile define allowed think scope defining item allowed modify
The combination user role profile scope called user role
In Service Manager click expand click pane display list user role
Each user role configured user role profile undefined scope
Since scope undefined user role exercise user profile management pack queue group task view form template
The following table list default user role associated user role profile scope
Service Manager Activity Implementers Activity Implementers Global Service Manager Administrators Administrators Global Service Manager Advanced Operators Advanced Operators Global Service Manager Change Initiators Change Initiators Global Service Manager End Users End Users Global Service Manager Operators Operators Global Service Manager Authors Authors Global Service Manager Problem Analysts Problem Analysts Global Service Manager Workflows Workflows Global Service Manager Incident Resolvers Incident Resolvers Global System Center Change Managers Change Managers Global Service Manager Report Report Users Global Release Manager Activity Designer For example want define one security access allows user create edit delete CIs another security access allows user create edit delete CIs
Appendix A end guide list user role profile associated artifact
The following table show user role profile relate configuration item
Report User No No No End Users No No No Operators No No No Activity Implementers No No No Change Initiators No No No Incident Resolvers No No No Problem Analysts No No No Change Manager No No No Advanced Operators Yes Yes No Authors Yes Yes Yes Workflows Yes Yes No Administrators Yes Yes Yes Using table see Advanced Operators user role profile create update delete CIs
The Authors user role profile create update delete CIs
These two user role profile use set asset management company
The member asset management team allowed create update delete CIs made member predefined Service Manager Advanced Operators profile
The member asset management team allowed create edit delete CIs made member predefined Authors profile
As best practice assume member asset management team might change
You create two group Active Directory make group member Advanced Operators Authors profile
Then member change user added removed group Active Directory change made Service Manager
In future break asset management team two group one desktop laptop create user role using user role profile different scope
When creating user role notice four user role listed Administrator End Users Report User Workflows
These four user role created populated setup generally speaking user role used Service Manager
The following section describe user role
The Administrator user role global scope therefore reason creating another user role type
By default End Users user role contains list authenticated user similar Administrator user role reason creating additional user role like
The Report User user role one purpose Service Manager To find computer hosting Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services SSRS user Service Manager console
When user Service Manager console try run report query made Service Manager management server seeking computer hosting data warehouse management server
The Service Manager console query data warehouse management server seeking name computer hosting SSRS
With information Service Manager console connects SSRS
The singular purpose Report User user role make query
After Service Manager console connects SSRS credential user running console grant access defined SSRS
Because narrow purpose user role reason creating another
Workflows might read write Service Manager database
During setup asked provide credential Workflows user role user role perform required action Service Manager database
Like Report User user role narrow purpose user role mean reason creating user role

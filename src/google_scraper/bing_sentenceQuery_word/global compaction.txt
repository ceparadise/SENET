Accordingly International Technology Roadmap Semiconductors ITRS last decade period continuous transition testing complex nanoscale semiconductor device faced strong shift classical methodology towards solution improve manufacturability reliability characteristic final product
Such trend valid year come design paradigm continuously moving towards complex SOC hence making difficult drive huge volume test data device test DUT
The latter aspect detailed Chapter Chapter current book
Due providing measurable structural fault coverage metric implemented deep component level able work autonomously operating speed BIST becomes necessary element modern high performance mission critical embedded system integrated circuit IC
By utilizing BIST diagnosis technique possible keep production cost reasonable level moving finer le reliable manufacturing technology
The technique often reused later life cycle check diagnose system field
BIST often part fault management system used fault tolerant device book see
Chapter Chapter
Traditional structural testing approach based external automated test equipment ATE use test data generated automated test pattern generator ATPG
In case ATPG test efficient term fault coverage test size Figure ATPG curve
However embedded testing pattern need stored internal memory make solution quite inefficient
As result BIST technique often based pattern generator PRPG represent simple structure generate necessary test stimulus device test DUT
A typical example embedded test generator widely used testing diagnosis contemporary complex electronic system Linear Feedback Shift Register LFSR
Internal structure LFSR sequence generates In Figure common internal structure LFSR shown
It consists D connected series feedback loop collected XOR gate

Each LFSR corresponding term polynomial accordingly order shift register
The constant term either depending presence absence corresponding feedback loop
The last term polynomial always matching feedback
The polynomial shown Figure hence four term
The state LFSR beginning test generation determined initial state parameter called
Hence seed polynomial fully predetermine resulting sequence therefore direct influence resulting test quality therefore play important role TPG
It main useful property LFSR circuit clocked repeatedly go fixed sequence unique state number explicit property randomness used therefore TPG BIST scheme Crouch Bushnell Agrawal
The maximum number unique state length LFSR
number
However case effective length sequence much shorter
Hence modern approach LFSR used
Its configuration based polynomial guarantee unique state arbitrary seed except state

Hence polynomial used example primitive one

My operating system textbook say compaction process rearranges disk block free disk block form contiguous chunk free disk space
But I always thought defragmentation
Are two term
Or I missing something
In modern disk operating system file subdivided block may stored arbitrary location disk
Files read quickly physical disk block stored consecutively I think every OS created since without difficulty create file larger single largest consecutive free area disk provided total size free area sufficient hold file
Such file end different piece stored different part disk thus accessing often fast entire file stored consecutively
Conceptually ideal disk arrangement would content every file stored consecutively file stored unused block consecutive range
Such arrangement would compacted defragmented
In general though amount effort arrange everything perfectly seldom worthwhile obvious exception disk written never modified would typically case

Defragmenting disk move block make file consecutive sequence block disk necessarily attempt eliminate free area file
Compacting disk consolidate free area moving data later part disk unused location earlier part may cause fragmentation existing file
Generally software performs defragmentation try avoid creating many scattered free area software performs compaction try avoid causing needle fragmentation depending upon software trying
maximize efficiency existing file versus preparing large contiguous area space preparation large operation need run smoothly software may focus one kind operation expense
mean moving memory area eliminate hole caused terminated five process A B C D E allocated memory
After sometime process B D terminated
Now memory layout
After applying compaction instead two memory unit one memory unit
mean storing complete file smallest number contiguous region
That try store file one complete unit size contiguous memory available
Suppose process A fragment process B fragment
Now suppose memory layout defragmentation
Defragmentation also contribute compaction

I trying construct parallel algorithm CUDA take array integer remove without keeping order
Example Global Memory Host Memory Result The simplest way use host remove time
But considering I around element probably faster leave everything GPU condense first sending
The preferred method would create stack thread pop push order onto stack
However I think CUDA implementation
An equivalent much slower method would keep attempting write thread finished writing This method benefit would perform time average number value array implementation thus time high constant Finally sort algorithm quicksort mergesort would also solve problem fact run relative time
I think might algorithm faster even need waste time ordering swapping element pair element pair order need kept
So I quite sure method would fastest I still think better way handling
Any suggestion
What asking classic parallel algorithm called
If Thrust option may simply use
This stable algorithm preserve relative order element
Rough sketch If Thrust option may implement stream compaction plenty literature topic
It fun reasonably simple exercise also basic building block complex parallel primitive
Strictly speaking stream compaction traditional sense stream compaction traditionally stable algorithm requirement include stability
This relaxed requirement could perhaps lead efficient implementation
Stream compaction well known problem lot code written Thrust Chagg cite two library implement stream compaction CUDA
If relatively new device support intrinsic function compute cdapability worth try small CUDA procedure performs stream compaction faster Thrust
Here find code minimal doc
Is us ballotting function single kernel fashion perform compaction
With answer I trying provide detail Davide Spataro approach
As mentioned stream compaction consists removing undesired element collection depending predicate
For example considering array integer predicate array compacted
The general idea stream compaction approach different computational thread assigned different element array compacted
Each thread must decide write corresponding element output array depending whether satisfies relevant predicate
The main problem stream compaction thus letting thread know position corresponding element must written output array
The approach alternative Thrust mentioned consists three step Step
Let number launched thread size vector compacted
The input vector divided size equal block size
The block intrinsic exploited count number thread block satisfying predicate pred
As result first step element array size contains number element meeting predicate pred corresponding block
Step
An exclusive scan operation performed array
As result second step thread know many element previous block write element
Accordingly know position write corresponding element offset related block
Step
Each thread computes mentioned offset using warp intrinsic function eventually writes output array
It noted execution step related warp scheduling
As consequence element order output array necessarily reflect element order input array
Of three step second performed CUDA primitive computationally significantly le demanding two
For array element mentioned approach executed card contrast CUDA
The mentioned approach appears faster two reason It specifically tailored card supporting warp intrinsic element The approach guarantee output ordering
It noticed tested approach also code available
Although latter code arranged single kernel call employ CUDA Thrust primitive better performance compared version
The full code available slightly optimized compared original Davide Spataro routine

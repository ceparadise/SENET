Science education controversial subject United States
Several state banned teaching evolution century notably state Tennessee
It followed state Tennessee accused Scopes high school teacher teaching evolution
Although found guilty fined trial showed declining public support Fundamentalists
The Scopes Trial important impact larger creation versus evolution debate
In following decade term evolution omitted many biology textbook even text discus
These ban teaching evolution overturned Supreme Court ruling
Since resurgence bill one passed
This Act allows public school use supplementary material critical scientific theory evolution global warming science classroom
The government state legislature also enacted regulation promoting science education
The passed soon Soviet Union launch Sputnik linked education issue national security
This law provided funding scholarship science program
In state government worked together produce set expectation science education
The written part trial Nazi doctor World War II
It introduced ten ethical principle regarding human experimentation first requires informed consent human subject
It also state experimentation human must necessary society preceded study animal protect subject injury disability death
The Nuremberg Code influential shaping regulation scientific research across world
For example developed World Medical Association establishes ethical principle medical community

Credit Anton Khrupin In column I explore various mean lawyer helped computer scientist stop inevitable collateral damage innovation unstoppable force legislation hit irresistible innovation Internet
I explore current controversy fake news Net neutrality platform regulation international perspective
The conclusion familiar lawyer computer scientist need prevent disastrous retrenchment toward splintered intranet
To avoid need intellectually pragmatic pursuing may mutually disagreeable aim minimal legislative reform achieve using independent expert advice
The alternative allow libertarian advocate enrage politician severe overregulation result
Regulation first harm
That easy state difficult achieve legislation clumsiest version engineering principle Screwdriver legislator every problem look like new bill solve worse international lawyer every problem look like new Convention Treaty needed
Yet reality law achieve enforce bad actor prevent egregious overreaching company user
More negatively worst law overlegislate interest monopoly old new prevent technological progress one example man carrying red flag front first motor vehicle protected stagecoach railway innovative competition
Heroic policy intervention government often fail especially aimed industry
Governments last year spent great deal time realizing little government effectively steering toward better industry well unintended consequence badly constructed legal mechanism
Experts continually advise favor independent scientific evidence gathering corporate public safety advocate claim sky falling
The dynamic least solution always lain expert opinion clamoring attention reaching expert requires patience focus part often distracted policymakers
Twenty year ago copytheft likely regulation
I briefly sketch three current controversy case study help u see go wrong law enforcement partially remedy bad lawmaking good science
news heartfelt cry politician feel wronged online medium
Ad blocking filter bubble made consumer voter harder reach
Industrial scale behavioral profiling viral marketing via Twitter bot new method
The expansion social networking smartphones mean new method communication necessary filtering content like
That applied tabloid newspaper method journalism radio news newswires year ago
Unfortunately failure adopt universal independent public service model meant public inflamed irresponsible medium series war first time made global communication mean telegraph railway radio reliable air maritime transport enabled mass medium
Today call fake news regulation pay regard historian technology legal historian advise public service medium
Twitter Facebook offer parallel Hearst newspaper radio broadcast
It high time interdisciplinary project exploring avoid disastrous outcome
Computer technology tool powerful insight new politician ignoring previous generation transformative technology attempt marshal
More obviously politician fully using tool behavioral insight explore regulate fake news social networking evolutionary economics behavioral neuroscience tell u become addicted social medium yet legislator beginning consult expert explore social networking affect behavior fundamental way
Social economic science well computer scientist neuroscientist help lawyer convince legislator silly
Net neutrality simple term describes complicated reality highly complex engineering task permit sufficient innovation network
The doomsayers side fail mention becoming abundantly clear policy partially steer traffic management practice
Net neutrality prevent large telecom company continuing blocking Skype WhatsApp throttling back video traffic subscriber want see
Net neutrality stop innovation telecom company whose corporate history show somewhat checkered relationship Internet protocol network deployment
Regulators simply competent even resource carry law letter
More scientific exploration limited effect Net neutrality policy would rather useful
An example regulator trying manner extensive work produced Body European Regulators Electronic Communications
How legislator discus complex law know difference Internet access provider IAP Internet service provider ISP
In European law access provider telco Communications Service Provider ECSP distinct Information Society Service Provider ISSP
Society Europe rhetorical counterpoint Al Gore Superhighway
Lawyers often fail master term
Minimal rule made sensibly technically proficient people achieving quietly million email message regulator legislator conduct rule stop telecom company blocking legitimate content giving latitude experiment harmful public Internet
Note common carriage rather successful way delivering public alongside private business communication service previous technology
Politicians ask What difference platform network
Journalists confuse reader referring company though access network perform fundamental entirely different function social network search engine
This canard thrown Net neutrality debate telco
If regulated argue also apply giant monopoly Google Apple Facebook Amazon known collectively
The high public profile Twitter Snap cause issue mean monopoly
Google fined European Commission June antitrust violation link search engine shopping platform
Google avoided adverse outcome eight year delay even longer Microsoft European investigation complaint resulted enforcement Case
dominated GAFA platform becoming major political issue especially Europe mass youth unemployment rapidly ageing workforce mean IT skill short supply especially Parliaments
promise untold rich autonomous vehicle fall politician deaf ear robot vote
This red flag advising government well legislating
If platform regulation signal desire slow pace innovation government rational answer sold government
The first essential prevent platform becoming liable publisher whatever legitimate mean necessary
That may mean fine failure take fake content revenge porn
It may mean user ombudsman suggested new proposed English legislation
Recruiting internal content checker Facebook Google remove content may overdue
Global platform need conform European rule hate speech instance Nazi content legal battle lost Yahoo
French year ago
What done
Europe set global standard regulation content notably data protection hate speech
The decisive power relationship European law swung Germany France
Regulation increase company increasingly recognize embracing French term
What mean diluting government control Internet ensuring compromise based industry oversight user government regulator
Examples include global Top Level domain name oversight
Governments sponsored industry standard Europe globally via hosting supporting World Wide Web Consortium industry
compromise computer scientist must live
Totalitarian regime want use threat terrorism replace direct often draconian control
best alternative
Areas cooperation law computer science flourish institution best engineer deliberative process
It curb worst excess corporate government control
If lawyer computer scientist cooperate make social regulation process work best chance prevent much worse system direct government control emerging

I write European Parliament involved gnarly wrangle new General Data Protection Regulation
At stake future rule online privacy data mining big data targeted advertising social science governmental spying proxy thousand activity heart many internet largest company politician darkest uncontrolled ambition
The lobbyist force
The activist I know go Brussels say never seen like veritable feeding frenzy lobbying
Hundreds amendment proposal table good bad making sense job
As complicated proposal one rule thumb borne mind whenever proposal table time someone speaks relaxing rule sharing data anonymised identifying information removed pseudonymised identifier replaced pseudonym assume proven otherwise talking rubbish
This kind iron law privacy used quickly weed nonsensical idea
What remains might good idea bad one least wo grounded
Anonymising data difficult business
When come anonymising three failure get widely cited AOL release anonymous search data State Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission release anonymised health record Netflix release record
In case researcher showed relatively simple technique could used data set usually picking element record made unique
There lot smoker health record narrow anonymous male black smoker born presented emergency room aching joint actually pretty simple merge anonymous record different anonymised database pop identity patient
Since become kind sport computer scientist keep blowing anonymisation scheme water clever trick
A showed anonymised data European phone company likely one Belgium could accuracy given four point data person two half user set could
Some say matter
They say privacy dead irrelevant unimportant
If agree remember reason anonymisation pseudonymisation contemplated General Data Protection Regulation author say privacy important worth preserving
They talking anonymising believe anonymisation protect privacy mean saying implicitly privacy worth preserving
If policy goal policy pursue way conform reality understand
Indeed whole premise Big Data odds idea data anonymised
After Big Data promise large subtle relationship teased
In world talk sparse data approach
Though personal trait shared many others thing le commonly represented set maybe confluence reading habit address maybe city birth combination choice car
These rarity practically leap data point straight Big Data conclusion meant
If Big Data find combination subtle environmental factor shared victim rare disease also find combination subtle identifier shared different present merge together make identity public
The EU lobbied like never one
EU Commissioner Viviane Reding I seen heavy lobbying operation
It working
Great chunk text
The lobbyist become de facto legislator get paid go boring meeting
Clause four General Data Protection Regulation contains definition used document one key battleground
It establishes idea thing anonymous data exempts regulation creates second category pseudonymous information handled fewer restriction placed personally identifying information
I asked two favourite computer scientist thought plausibility anonymising pseudonymising data set
Seth David Schoen staff technologist Electronic Frontier Foundation told Researchers shown anonymisation much harder look
Just something seems anonymous first glance mean really mathematics individual distinctiveness huge number database becoming available
That mean extremely careful whether thing truly anonymous rely intuition alone
Princeton Ed Felten formerly US Federal Trade Commission A decade computer science research show many data set
Removing obvious identifier enough prevent
Removing data individual may enough
Even data set consisting entirely aggregate information used infer information specific individual realistic case
But say utterly hopeless would go far
There emerging science data analysis applied setting
As general rule data derived characteristic individual including behavioral data likely convey information individual absent rigorous technical basis believing otherwise
The trend toward treating like cryptography scrambled data bunch valid argument ca think attack valid argument technically rigorous argument attack possible
As see careful rule possibility someone might day come anonymisation scheme neither bullish creation regulatory category anonymous data treated though held risk people collected
I asked reading
Felten suggested Arvind Narayanan Vitaly Shmatikov excellent primer technical issue June Communications Association Computing Machinery
Schoen recommended Paul Ohm comprehensive legal history idea anonymisation regulation published edition UCLA Law Review
For part I recommend fantastic somewhat technical look inference drawn seemingly innocuous coming mobile phone Proceedings Third International Workshop Sensing Applications Mobile Phones
Microsoft pushed approach call differential privacy sound like may hold promise
As Schoen describes researcher pose research question original data controller return intentionally answer allegedly mathematically quantify much privacy harm done process debate whether worthwhile light benefit research
But conjecture though amount fuzzing done data quantitative matter degree privacy protected fuzziness ultimately personal question turning feel disclosure consequence
As often case technical solution embodies bunch assumption question ultimately social hotly contested
You ca settle argument whether privacy violated math alone
It fascinating think larger point regulation breezily asserts data anonymous even pseudonymous regulation violently disconnected best theory computer science
Where find regulation know author either serious protecting privacy qualified draft regulation
Either way cause alarm

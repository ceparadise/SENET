A chemical indicator substance undergoes distinct observable change condition change
This could color change precipitate formation bubble formation temperature change measurable quality
Another type indicator may encountered chemistry science pointer light device instrument may show pressure volume temperature etc
condition piece equipment power available memory space
The term indicator come Medieval Latin word indicate suffix
To useful chemical indicator must sensitive easily detectable
It need however show visible change
The type indicator depends used
For example sample analyzed spectroscopy may employ indicator would visible naked eye test calcium aquarium would need produce obvious color change
Another important quality indicator change condition sample
For example methyl yellow add yellow color alkaline solution acid added solution color remains yellow pH neutral
At point color change yellow red
At low level methyl yellow change acidity sample
Typically methyl yellow used extremely low concentration part per million range
This small amount sufficient see visible change color enough change sample
But If enormous amount methyl yellow added specimen
Not might color change invisible addition much methyl yellow would change chemical composition sample
In case small sample separated larger volume tested using indicator produce significant chemical change
There error

A pH indicator indicator change color narrow range value
Only small amount indicator compound needed produce visible color change
When used dilute solution pH indicator significant impact acidity alkalinity chemical solution
The principle behind function indicator reacts water form hydrogen cation H hydronium ion H O
The reaction change color indicator molecule
Some indicator change one color another others change colored colorless state
pH indicator usually
Many molecule occur naturally
For example anthocyanins found flower fruit vegetable pH indicator
Plants containing molecule include red cabbage leaf rose petal flower blueberry rhubarb stem hydrangea flower poppy flower
natural pH indicator derived mixture lichen
For weak acid formula HIn equilibrium chemical equation would HIn aq H O l H O aq In aq At low pH concentration hydronium ion high equilibrium position lie left
The solution color indicator HIn
At high pH concentration hydronium low equilibrium right solution color conjugate base In
In addition pH indicator two type indicator used chemistry
Redox indicator used titration involving oxidation reduction reaction
Complexometric indicator used quantify metal cation
Because indicator change color different pH range may sometimes combined offer color change wider pH range
For example contains thymol blue methyl red bromothymol blue thymol blue phenolphthalein
It cover pH range le red greater violet
Intermediate color include pH green pH neutral blue pH
pH indicator used give rough value pH chemical solution
For precise measurement pH meter used
Alternatively absorbance spectroscopy may used pH indicator calculate pH using Beer law
Spectroscopic pH measurement using single indicator accurate within one pKa value
Combining two indicator increase accuracy measurement
Indicators used titration show completion reaction

Charles deep love ecology
He enjoys reading anything related ecology spare time
Most plant specie require variety condition ensure optimal growth production
The level condition also critical determining plant going healthy
For example let compare two simple plant Rice plant Aloe Vera plant
These two plant require moisture survive grow healthy
However level moisture requires totally different
The Rice plant normally requires high level moisture whereas Aloe Vera plant really need much moisture
We therefore make accurate guess find Rice plant growing healthily site soil site likely wet
So see possible make inference ecological condition pertaining site plant available site
Plants rely various environmental factor different proportion
Some common environmental factor huge influence survival optimal growth plant Light Temperature Continentality Moisture Soil PH Nitrogen Salinity
The Ellenberg indicator value based simple ordinal classification plant according position realized ecological niche along environmental gradient
They first model bioindication proposed applied flora Germany long tradition interpretation understanding plant community evolution
To able understand use value first need gain understanding key term
A niche role organism play community
It important note habitat organism niche
A habitat simply part organism niche
There two type niche fundamental niche realized niche
Fundamental niche refers specie live negating effect competition predation resource location factor
The realized niche specie tend live factor mentioned forced retreat part fundamental niche
Abiotic factor chemical environment physical force environment
They huge influence living organism affect ecosystem work
Examples abiotic factor wind soil nitrogen water sunlight
An environmental gradient hand gradual change abiotic factor space time
This gradual change often represented numerically
Ellenberg indicator value simple indicator value sometimes also various abiotic factor
Indicator value give information physiological requirement specie give information regarding ecological performance specie competition potential versus existing real situation
That give information performance plant realized niche
They used estimate abiotic parameter also used monitor change key parameter time
The table give illustration indicator value various environmental factor
Here given Ellenberg indicator value realized ecological niche
How use value estimate abiotic condition site
The value mean likely found infertile soil
These type soil mostly sandy soil
The value stinging nettle mean likely found site close farm human settlement indicates high presence nitrogen nutrient soil
Although Ellenberg indicator value powerful estimating abiotic condition example found growing soil soil certainly acid
Also found growing soil soil certainly basic knowledge specie needed
Determination specie level required make use Ellenberg indicator value

Some language use idea deriving typical mode evaluation left right hand side assignment statement
An lvalue refers object persists beyond single expression
An rvalue temporary value persist beyond expression us
The notion introduced CPL
The notion expression analogous mode input parameter value assigned parameter value assigned though technical detail differ context language
In many language notably programmatically accessible running program via operator like meaning variable dereferenced reference certain memory location

Consider C expression
When executed computer generates integer value program explicitly designated computer stored expression non
On hand C program declares variable x assigns value x expression value
In C term originally meant something could assigned hence name indicating left side assignment operator since reserved word constant added language term

This question already answer Specifically I seen used context text filtering
As predicate filter criterion
Is accurate
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
It term commonly used field Mathematical Logic
From In mathematics predicate either amount characteristic function indicator function relation
A function P true false called predicate X
When P predicate X sometimes say P property
predicate filter criterion A predicate part sentence contains verb tell something subject
For instance sentence Mike eating subject predicate eating
In context computer science interested stating fact rather testing condition purpose deciding whether something
The member instance predicate
It return assertion case eating
The predicate used decide whether feed person
Predicates often found form callback general use term function return bool based evaluation truth assertion
For sorting might want member function predicate
If come u sorting algorithm swap two fruit
There also term predicate
In English use like Graduation predicated upon attainment passing grade
It mean one thing depends another
In computer science use form word describe conditional execution
For instance CUDA programming assembly instruction whose execution predicate KATE prior result
That set predicate CAT flag true cause instruction executed false cause instruction treated NOP
Thus execution instruction predicated upon indicated predicate flag
The us similar
Hope help
The word come logic
A predicate boolean question input
IsNull predicate question
Also wikipedia link
A predicate statement something either true false
Proposition Predicate Use quantifier transform predicate proposition Just simplify thing
predicate function return true false value
used filter criterion meaning let consider array number predicate return true number false wise
filter function return new array based predicate filter criterion
filtered array based value predicate Predicate function take one element input parameter return either true false
Predicates used higher order function applied given function transformer list element return list result
Transformer function applies element produce one new element

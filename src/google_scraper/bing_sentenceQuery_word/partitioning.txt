A partition section hard disk
When format hard disk usually choose number partition want
The computer recognize partition separate disk show My Computer Windows desktop Macintosh
So would want create multiple partition
Well two main reason
One want multiple operating system computer
Typically operating system need installed partition wo conflict operating system machine
The reason multiple partition improve efficiency hard disk
On larger disk cluster block size minimum amount space file take larger small disk
This result waste disk space lot small file
So creating multiple partition actually give space
Yep room
Partition also used verb meaning create multiple partition
Cite definition This page contains technical definiton Partition
It explains computing terminology Partition mean one many technical term TechTerms dictionary

creation one region manage information region separately
Partitioning typically first step preparing newly manufactured disk created
The disk store information partition location size area known operating system read part disk
Each partition appears operating system distinct logical disk us part actual disk
use program called create resize delete manipulate partition
When hard drive installed computer must partitioned format use
Partitioning drive divide total storage drive different piece
These piece called partition
Once partition created formatted used computer
Creating one partition following advantage Creating one partition following disadvantage compared single partition spanning disk area This section describes MBR partitioning scheme used historically among others computer system
As new computer use GPT partitioning scheme instead
For example partitioning scheme see general article
The total data storage space PC HDD MBR partitioning implemented contain four alternatively three primary partition
The located master boot record contains entry describes partition
The identified code found partition table entry
Some code may used indicate presence
Most used operating system bootloader examines partition table decide partition contains file system used reading writing data
A primary partition contains one file system
In early version system required called first partition
All Windows operating system Windows onwards located almost partition boot file etc
must reside primary partition
However factor PC see may also impose specific requirement partition must contain primary OS
The partition type primary partition either correspond file system contained within
mean either file system indicate partition special use
code usually indicates Linux partition
The file system made use number partition type code due limit various DOS Windows OS version
Though Linux operating system may recognize number different file system etc
consistently used partition type code
An HDD may contain one extended partition extended partition subdivided multiple logical partition
system may logical partition
With common practice use one primary partition active contain operating system file utility application user data
On Windows consumer computer C routinely assigned primary partition
Other partition may exist may may visible drive recovery partition partition diagnostic tool data
Microsoft drive letter correspond partition fashion may fewer drive letter partition
Microsoft include program allows creation deletion resizing FAT NTFS partition
The Windows Disk Manager Windows Vista Windows utilizes scheme fundamentally Windows XP DOS well many operating system
On operating system possible use multiple partition disk device
Each partition formatted
Multiple partition allow directory allocated filesystems
Such scheme number advantage A common configuration Linux desktop system use two partition one holding file system mounted
By default macOS system also use single partition entire filesystem use inside file system like Windows rather swap partition
In Solaris partition sometimes known
This conceptual reference slicing cake several piece
The term slice used operating system refer partition avoid confusion FreeBSD partitioning scheme
However partition referred partition worldwide
system computer user boot one two distinct operating system OS stored separate storage device separate partition storage device
In system menu give choice OS one OS time loaded
This distinct one operating system run virtual program within another operating system
An example Windows OS virtual machine running within Linux OS
The part UEFI standard layout physical
Many operating system support standard
When partition deleted entry removed table data longer accessible
The data remains disk overwritten
Partition Recovery may able locate file system recreate partition table includes entry recovered file system
Some disk utility may overwrite number beginning sector partition delete
For example Windows Disk Management Windows etc
used delete partition overwrite first sector relative sector partition removing
It still may possible restore partition backup boot sector available
HDDs compressed create additional space
In DOS early Microsoft Windows program except DR DOS Windows used
This compression done creating large file partition storing disk data file
At startup device driver opened file assigned separate letter
Frequently avoid confusion original partition compressed drive letter swapped compressed disk C uncompressed area often containing system file given higher name
Versions using NT kernel including recent version XP Vista contain intrinsic disk compression capability
The use separate disk compression utility declined sharply

What difference graph theory
Graph partitioning graph clustering informal concept usually mean partitioning vertex set constraint example number part objective function maximized minimized
We usually specific constraint objective function mind
However vague informal concept pretty much
There tends emphasis edge partitioning
A good partition defined one number edge running separated component small

On hand clustering tends vertex
This entirely linguistic artifact I would expect prevalent writing
Of course challenging separate role vertex edge defining nearness connectedness distinction necessarily somewhat artificial

v To divide isolated section
In partition partition behave like separate
Partitioning particularly useful one
For example might reserve one partition Windows another
In addition partitioning DOS Windows machine improve disk efficiency
This used operating system automatically assigns size based disk size larger disk larger cluster
Unfortunately large cluster result wasted disk space called
There entire sector software industry devoted building let partition hard disk

With hard partitioning usually necessary reformat entire disk

A S separation set arbitrary number pairwise disjoint subset whose union exactly What manner data structure used represent partition set following method need optimized A naive way prioritizing would mapping set element part label iterating part would require O N first constructing actual part label

As lot people know graph partitioning
In graph partitioning try create k balanced within epsilon disjoint subset possibly weighted vertex edgecut minimized
See
But simpler problem partitioning set arbitrarily weighted object k balanced disjoint subset seeking minimize edgecut applicable graph imbalance
It seems simpler problem still either least based similarity problem Graph Partitioning Bin Packing Subset Sum Multiprocessor Scheduling Set Cover etc
Is real name problem one I made title
And anyone know formal paper official citable source proving complexity
Last least primary reason I looking best known heuristic problem
I currently greedy approach iteratively placing next heaviest object total set currently lightest partition
But possible better
Thanks
The problem contains problem Partition problem
If instance extremely huge I would give integer programming formulation try
The heuristic build modern solver probably competitive come without implementation work side
For heuristic local search seems natural approach
After greedily generating start solution repeat following step
To spice bit one could GRASP see
That mean greedy generation start solution randomized instead adding heaviest object lightest block object randomly chosen heaviest added block randomly chosen lightest
Then start local search becomes boring generate new randomized greedy start solution
This procedure iterated often varying one keep track parameter tend lead good solution

When referring computer section hard drive separated segment
Partitions help enable user divide computer hard drive different drive different portion number reason
For example allowing multiple run device
With older file allocation table creating smaller partition allows computer hard drive run efficiently save disk space
However new file allocation table longer case
There also dozen different partition type
Below listing partition brief description

Researchers developed computer program defeat even best human player
Illustration Peter Maria By Card shark beware
A new program beaten variety poker called limit Texas Hold least human team computer scientist report
Researchers previously developed unbeatable algorithm game checker new work mark first time scientist found algorithm solved complex game information state game card opponent hand remains hidden player
The program yielded insight could help player improve game general approach may usefulness security health care application
Because hidden information luck draw program wo necessarily win every hand explains computer scientist Michael Bowling University Alberta Edmonton Canada led study
But average program good human would chance ever edging ahead even two played million hand
So purpose anyone would ever care solved game Bowling say
Some game easier solve others
For example even child learn force draw every time
In contrast took computer scientist year plenty computing power
And either game much simpler poker number reason
In checker player full knowledge state game every turn
In poker player see card
And unlike checker poker involves luck betting bluffing factor make impossible find strategy guarantee win draw every hand
In fact poker complicated Bowling colleague decided study relatively specialized version called limit Texas Hold em
In two player compete size bet limited
To begin player place bet dealt two card
Three laid middle table
Then two card played table
Each player try make best three card table
After round card player check bet match opponent bet raise bet fold
During round betting player must least match opponent bet stay game
In end one fold better hand win pot
The researcher developed strategy pitting computer series training round
After playing computer examined move see making different choice would improved result
It calculated regret mathematical measure much lost imperfect move
As computer practiced improved strategy regret gradually diminished
In solved game regret would zero move would perfect
After training algorithm computer regret close zero game could beaten human lifetime
In way computer calculated vast table strategy possible action game
For every hand computer look whether fold bet
Given hand program always take action instead bet certain fraction time fold certain fraction time
The program even weak hand program usually fold occasionally bet
Bluffing turn mathematical basis optimized action
Technically value regret function researcher achieved mean game exactly solved even better program could found
But strategy good essentially pointless keep looking better algorithm say computer scientist Murray Campbell IBM Thomas Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights New York work program
In poker never get exact perfect solution get close nobody could ever tell difference
Phil Laak professional poker player based Los Angeles California played earlier program Bowling group say program like one useful tool professional
Such program say improve game might worry take joy
Poker somehow grab imagination romance attached I think forever exist said
In fact program may already providing insight game
The program play larger range hand professional player making bet weak hand professional player tend fold
It also confirmed conventional wisdom dealer round hold advantage
But although new strategy never lose may maximize winning situation
When playing weak player strategy conservative rake biggest possible winning
Although study poker may seem like fun game advance game theory application area airport security coast guard patrol health care people must make decision using limited information available
I think exciting step paper make I think part broader development algorithm say Vincent Conitzer computer scientist Duke University Durham North Carolina
More able apply directly game whether poker kind strategic situation come By By By By By Vol Issue

Libratus artificial intelligence robot chip worth four world top poker player challenge Pittsburgh casino Libratus artificial intelligence robot chip worth four world top poker player challenge Pittsburgh casino San Francisco An artificial intelligence called Libratus beaten four world best poker player gruelling tournament culminated late Monday
The Brains v Artificial Intelligence competition saw four human player Dong Kim Jason Les Jimmy Chou Daniel McAulay spend hour day stationed computer screen Rivers Casino Pittsburgh battling piece software Texas Hold em unlimited form poker
Libratus outmanoeuvred winning chip
Thankfully poker pro playing real money It crushing defeat humanity major milestone artificial intelligence
Machines already become smart enough beat human game poker difficult game imperfect information
With chess Go player see entire board poker player get see hand
Furthermore AI required bluff correctly interpret misleading information order win
This challenge huge complicated elusive AI researcher said Carnegie Mellon University professor computer science along PhD student built Libratus
Sandholm said confident Libratus would beat poker pro
The international betting site put u underdog human expected Alas
They put best fight could said Brown
They match Libratus improved Sandholm Brown previous AI called Claudico
Claudico competed lost four poker pro tournament
Its successor clearly revenge
Libratus computing power enhanced algorithmic approach game particularly way deal imperfect hidden information
We tell Libratus play poker
We gave rule poker said learn said Brown
The bot started playing randomly course playing trillion hand able refine approach arrive winning strategy
Late day poker play ended Brown would connect Libratus Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center Bridges computer run algorithm improve strategy overnight
In morning would spend two hour getting newly enhanced bot back running
At time human playing eating dinner spending hour reviewing AI hand game tweaking strategy getting sleep around
The schedule gruelling poker pro
Libratus turned way better imagined
It slightly demoralizing said Jason Les also played Claudico two year ago
If play human lose stop take break
Here show take beating every day hour day
It real different emotional experience used losing often said Les
A photo posted carnegiemellon carnegiemellon It bad Les get split prize pot depending well relative Libratus
They also learned Libratus thanks robot aggressive style play see make huge bet win small prize pot
It something human would normally force toe game said Les
It almost like shellshocked much stronger player
Nothing anyone seem crazy For Brown seeing Libratus win induced proud parent feeling
When I see bot bluff human I like I tell
I idea even capable It satisfying know I created something The algorithm power Libratus specific poker mean system could variety application outside recreational game negotiating business deal setting military cybersecurity strategy planning medical treatment anywhere human required strategic reasoning imperfect information
Poker least concern said Roman V Yampolskiy professor computer science University Louisville
You machine kick as business military application
I worried humanity whole deal For Brown Libratus challenge preconception machine intelligence versus human intelligence
People idea poker human game bot bluff example
That totally wrong
It reading opponent trying tell lying card probability said
We seeing type thing machine excel although I see computer writing novel time A hand

In scrum framework planning poker used estimate effort required complete work user story
A tool describe new software feature user
These user story used planning future work
The Scrum team minimum includes representative primary stakeholder customer development team participant planning poke
The role product owner present user story rest team
The development team role ask clarifying question ensure requirement understood estimate effort estimate user story product owner prompted
Planning poker intended estimate user story prepared future sprint
A sprint set typically week set task must completed delivery customer
To ensure work sprint manageable development team feature sprint represented user story discussed estimated
This give product owner customer ability include maximum amount feature software look behaves team complete within sprint
As imagine feature complex others poker important ensuring development team
Just like real poker planning poker originally played playing card
Teams today often use apps device estimating well
During planning poker team discus complexity feature possible technical approach long believe take implement feature assumption must broken
The discussion item also limit time spent complex issue
The team pose question product owner representative planning session
At end discussion development team selects representing estimate user story discussed
This done brief countdown
The entire team reveals estimate simultaneously reduce bias one assume peer pressure
Based reveal process likely development team differing estimate
This opportunity product owner solicit feedback member highest lowest estimate
Their insight help guide discussion user story team estimate
This continues consensus estimate reached
Get FREE access day create account
Different team use different method estimate
The scrum framework limit method estimate
Some team estimate actual hour
Others use size XS S M L XL number Fibonacci Sequence

The philosophy behind abstract method ensure estimate predictive
This result several negative consequence including team padding estimate spending significant amount time trying make estimate accurate
Relative estimate allow team product owner understand complexity one feature compared another
These abstract size called unit
If estimate big XL Fibonacci sequence indicates team requirement fully understood request big broken
In instance planning poker force development team ask product owner plenty clarifying question help product owner write clearly defined user story
At end planning poker session product owner good idea complex user story
Each user story estimate unit abstract approach hour
The development team able complete set number hour unit within sprint
This known team
The estimate allow product owner plan user story bundled together sprint get work scheduled
Planning poker technique scrum framework intended clarify complexity presented
The goal make sure user story accurately capture requirement product owner asking product owner understands much effort would take complete item
This empowers product owner plan future sprint within constraint team velocity

The video changed way I teach
The video accomplish would take entire class
Chris Students condition performed better receiving instruction
Department Education

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Summary case want read wiki article Usually something similar number Fibonacci sequence like allowed value get long argument close value like v
Further number represent value effort whose value determined baseline task everyone agrees equal else relative
Ultimately goal get good feel given team velocity number point completed given iteration
With possible make reasonably accurate estimate long given feature take
We iteration planning meeting one company I worked I thought one good thing particular company
So I wondering anyone used
Do think useful tool estimation
Does work situation lend certain team project etc
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
We use company project I involved
Some note planning poker expressed bigger list cool It make everyone
People accept result instead forced make estimate
The time defend estimate also allocated necessary
It
You ca slack meeting trying show involved
Also necessity moving hand constitutes good physical exercise keep sleeping
However downside sometimes need something else example take note write detail agreement reached
It
There need constant involvement meeting leader keep everything pace
The game clear rule way better
Yes need make extra move put card reveal et cetera pay way
A lot especially poker This increase motivation
A company sell deck card accompanied site also worth reading
We use extensively
I find several advantage traditional method I agree Pavel point
There also one thing valuable
It level playing field discussion
Often quiet people drowned verbal people group discussion
Planning poker give everybody chance make decision active discussion begin
And quiet person provides outlier opinion full stage present case
Therefore technique empowers quieter contributor ensures full team participation
After used planning poker sprint management finally realized u developer known month finish time
Planning poker accurately story point based estimation much accurate traditional estimation practice combine easy way estimate combined complexity entire feature set actual measurement team actual capacity
There many good answer already I wanted point one feature
When use planning poker get instant measure big disagreement size work
If I think think call move
But I think think better discus
It make everyone talk think done
Even I going work I pay attention estimate
That help month I need work something touch area
It also easy grasp
Show people work breakdown structure eye glaze start drooling sleep
Show list task next week understand
Another good thing The discussion whether task X help team nail exactly scope later discrepancy task X entailed
I like Pavel point would like add really help junior developer noobs learn lot faster
They ca sit back let senior developer rule
Their vote count much really focus making estimate accurate learn lot senior developer
I dislike current team primarily people fundamentally buy
We spend significant portion grooming session debating whether pointing worthwhile product owner never break epic usually end wildly kilter estimate story point indicate thing need broken
Nothing like two single sprint

I looking way make easier perform planning poker virtual team
team one another
Requirements successful planning poker The obvious answer tool found seems bit heavy need
I want make team member sign account entering story seems like bit much
We tried thing like holding chat session online everyone process get little biased fact people see input others
What else could I hold successful planning poker session virtual team
Since appear many specific solution problem I ended writing simple web app meet need
I think even team might like use
Check Google Hangouts
So team meeting virtual folk still see planning poker almost effective get team member room
I done lot distributed planning year without formal planning poker estimate
Here tip worked
Have written backlog story
It matter spreadsheet Google Docs Trello planning poker app make sure backlog written somewhere everyone access
If else fails single document shared screen
VNC Google Hangouts Mikogo suffice emergency
Avoid people message vote Scrum Master privately big reveal
Scrum team average seven nine people plus Scrum Master onerous
Let Scrum Master collect vote share group
Other viable alternative include If stuck using planning session let people meeting email estimate Scrum Master reveal
Since additional vote often reconciling outlying vote anchoring somewhat le important since folk openly discussing story estimate point anyway
Alternatively Scrum Master put conference call hold call people individually additional vote
Be creative
Ask team
Planning poker estimation tool required Scrum artifact practice
If planning poker work team invite brainstorm better way help team estimate easiest common Scrum Master
The simplest thing I think
You set server Skype participant log time enter number
I think need take another look
It simple I imagine heavy
Only leader would type paste story even could refer story number URL whatever want
Also one leader log participant even log
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

While study psychology forecasting stress possible hazard group process predicting effort schedule agile software development method recommend use group estimation technique called planning poker estimating size user story developing release iteration plan
It assumed group discussion planning poker help identifying activity individual estimator could overlook thus providing accurate estimate reducing typical expert method
In spite widespread use agile method little empirical evidence regarding accuracy planning poker estimate
In order fill gap study conducted requiring student team develop student record information system
All team given set user story implemented three Sprints
Each team estimated story using planning poker estimate provided team member first round averaged obtain statistical combination comparison
In way story estimated group expert
The study revealed estimate planning poker additionally increased
On hand estimate obtained planning poker much closer actual effort spent tended accurate statistical combination individual estimate
The result indicate optimism bias caused group discussion diminishes even disappears expertise people involved group estimation process increase
Planning poker compared mean individual estimate
Estimates provided ten student team group expert analyzed
Planning poker increase inexperienced developer
The optimism bias diminishes disappears increasing expertise
Planning poker improve estimate motivated experienced professional

Computers figured win chess checker computer program conquered game poker
A research team led Michael Bowling professor computer science University Alberta Canada developed computer program outplay human poker game specifically limit hold
The result could implication situation foreign policy medical treatment
Unlike chess checker poker one player always know past move player
Plus player win hand player fold
Therefore mathematical term game imperfect information
perfect play solution answer given position win black win white draw Bowling said
Poker probabilistic
In word absolutely perfect hand strategy
In version hold poker played bet two player fixed number raise limited
The dealer give player two card called hole card
A round betting follows known
After three card laid table called flop
The flop set community card dealt face player know
Another round betting follows fourth card put table called turn
After third round last community card dealt known river point player show hole card assuming one player folded yet
The computer calculate every possible hand play
Instead build table result game start
Using central processing unit two month equal year computing time simulates billion hand poker
The table result alone took terabyte computer storage Bowling said
For comparison typical backup drive desktop one terabyte
The algorithm go possible hand opposing player could tally result tactic example raising folding calling bet matching opponent
To get idea big task trillion different situation come game
To get every human Earth would play nearly hand poker
This differs chess game progress get result good enough win
Contrary many people think computer program actually go every single permutation one produce best result
Imagine instead computer look result billion previous game specific configuration piece board
As billion hand played program converges best move given hand
The way work already played billion billion hand poker Bowling said
Because poker solvable way chess checker Bowling team came different set requirement calling game solved
In scientific term game essentially solved mean way exploit strategy computer us
The researcher assumed person played computer year day per year hour day
The program wrote played well big blind fixed bet perfect player win per hand big blind
Other expert worked computer used casino least one company say designed adjusts strategy according human player
But none demonstrated exploitability ability perfect human player beat machine small program designed Bowling team
Nor solved game mathematically rigorous way
But algorithm limitation
For one work game
In game possible one player could terrible strategy instance perhaps player tendency raise time loses le second player better strategy resulting win third player
Another problem figuring test game fairly
One experiment could two human play machine Bowling said human player may collude machine even unintentionally
Similar problem could arise experiment two machine player one human Even two program collude might look way human
We know run fairly said
Bowling said technology could diverse us ranging national security tracking fare evasion transit system making decision medical treatment
For example program could help doctor need make decision treatment unsure possible outcome
The method used poker program could help doctor identify treatment option optimal result one best probability success

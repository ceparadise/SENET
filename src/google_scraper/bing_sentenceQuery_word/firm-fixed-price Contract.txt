Fixed price contract bit
You propose single price accomplish work sought
Once project complete government customer pay agreed price
Your cost complete work factor much paid
Firm Fixed Price FFP contract detailed requirement price work
The price negotiated contract finalized vary even contractor need expend le resource planned
Firm fixed price contract require contractor manage cost work order make profit
If work planned required contractor may lose money contract
Fixed Price Contract Incentive Firm Target FPIF contract firm fixed price type contract compared
The fee vary depending whether contract come planned cost
These contract contain ceiling price limit government exposure cost overrun
Fixed price economic price adjustment contract fixed price contract contain provision account contingency changing cost
An example contract may contain adjustment annual salary increase
Fixed price contract lucrative cause big loss company
Computing proposed fixed price follows similar cost plus contract pricing
Study request proposal carefully determining scope work completed labor category personnel needed material procured
A conservative approach scoping work resulting higher proposed cost preferred offset risk level work taking effort money planned
However propose high price could lose contract competitive
Start computing fixed price propose creating general work breakdown structure WBS project
Using work breakdown structure estimate number needed complete phase project
Add material travel direct cost labor priced labor rate get proposed contract cost
Add fringe overhead general administrative rate appropriate cost get proposed project cost
Fee added planned cost obtain final fixed price propose
When deciding fee take careful account amount risk project going least well planned
Any risk cost overrun factored fee
If feel confident complete work proposed cost reduce fee competitive
For example contract provide mowing service base estimate amount labor required fairly accurately since amount mowing well defined
If contract develop new renewable fuel type tank risk incurring cost planned much greater
Fee rate range couple percent depending risk level
Note government competitor also computing project risk level related fee reasonable realistic computation
Here couple fixed price contract come play
When propose know fee type required request proposal
If economic adjustment allowed need propose percentage year contract
This also called escalation
Modify computed fixed price match request proposal submit winning proposal

Cost reimbursable contract involve government paying actual cost complete work
Cost reimbursable contract variety scheme providing fee profit contractor
Time material contract agreed rate labor material change contract billed incurred
Time material contract annual escalation rate incorporated reflect increasing cost
A cost plus incentive fee contract one vendor reimbursed cost incurred plus fee based formula tied cost
The fee formula vary normally designed encourage contractor keep cost
A cost reimbursement contract objective contract determined completed subjective mean
The contractor receives reimbursement cost plus award fee
Cost plus award fee contract used cost plus fixed fee cost plus incentive fee contract would appropriate
A cost plus fixed fee contract reimburses contractor cost incurred complete work plus negotiated fixed fee
The fee change based cost work
Cost calculated based actual amount paid labor material plus fringe overhead general administrative rate
Fringe overhead general administrative rate computed annually reflect actual corporate cost
Many cost reimbursable
FFP contract detailed requirement price work
The price negotiated contract finalized vary even contractor need expend le resource planned
Firm fixed price contract require contractor manage cost work order make profit
If work planned required contractor may lose money contract unless contract modification obtained
Firm fixed price contract also profitable cost closely managed
The fixed price contract incentive fee contract firm fixed price type contract compared cost reimbursable

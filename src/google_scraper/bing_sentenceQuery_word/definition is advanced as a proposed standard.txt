In unambiguous specification solve class problem
Algorithms perform task
An algorithm expressed within finite amount space time formal language calculating
Starting initial state initial input perhaps instruction describe proceeds finite number successive state eventually producing output terminating final ending state
The transition one state next necessarily algorithm known incorporate random input
The concept existed century however partial formalization would become modern began attempt solve decision problem posed
Subsequent formalization framed attempt define effective method formalization included
Giving formal definition algorithm corresponding intuitive notion remains challenging problem
The word combination word named word
αριθμός meaning number
mathematician scholar whose name mean native region part
About wrote treatise Arabic language translated century title
This title mean Algoritmi number Indians Algoritmi translator Latinization name
widely read mathematician Europe late Middle Ages primarily book
In late medieval Latin English corruption name simply meant decimal number system
In century influence Greek word ἀριθμός Latin word altered corresponding English term first attested century modern sense introduced century
In English first used
English adopted French term late century algorithm took meaning modern English
Another early use word manual titled composed
It begin thus translates Algorism art present use Indian figure number two time five
The poem hundred line long summarizes art calculating new style Indian dice Talibus Indorum Hindu numeral
An informal definition could set rule precisely defines sequence operation
would include computer program including program perform numeric calculation
Generally program algorithm stop eventually
A prototypical example algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integer example others described example later section
offer informal meaning word following quotation No human write fast enough long enough small smaller smaller without limit trying write molecule atom electron list member enumerably infinite set writing name one another notation
But human something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite set They give arbitrary finite
Such instruction given quite explicitly form An enumerably infinite set one whose element put correspondence integer
Thus Boolos Jeffrey saying algorithm implies instruction process creates output integer input integer integer theory arbitrarily large
Thus algorithm algebraic equation two arbitrary input variable produce output
But various author attempt define notion indicate word implies much something order addition example The concept also used define notion
That notion central explaining come starting small set rule
In time algorithm requires complete measured apparently related customary physical dimension
From uncertainty characterize ongoing work stem unavailability definition suit concrete sense abstract usage term
Algorithms essential way computer process data
Many computer program contain algorithm detail specific instruction computer perform specific order carry specified task calculating employee paycheck printing student report card
Thus algorithm considered sequence operation simulated system
Authors assert thesis include Minsky Savage Gurevich Minsky But also maintain Turing


procedure could naturally called effective fact realized simple machine
Although may seem extreme argument


favor hard refute
Gurevich Turing informal argument favor thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm simulated Turing machine according Savage algorithm computational process defined Turing machine
Typically algorithm associated processing information data read input source written output device stored processing
Stored data regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm
In practice state stored one
For computational process algorithm must rigorously defined specified way applies possible circumstance could arise
That conditional step must systematically dealt criterion case must clear computable
Because algorithm precise list precise step order computation always crucial functioning algorithm
Instructions usually assumed listed explicitly described starting top going bottom idea described formally
So far discussion formalization algorithm assumed premise
This common conception attempt describe task discrete mechanical mean
Unique conception formalized algorithm setting value variable
It derives intuition scratchpad
There example assignment
For alternate conception constitutes algorithm see
Algorithms expressed many kind notation including processed
Natural language expression algorithm tend verbose ambiguous rarely used complex technical algorithm
Pseudocode flowchart control table structured way express algorithm avoid many ambiguity common natural language statement
Programming language primarily intended expressing algorithm form executed computer often used way define document algorithm
There wide variety representation possible one express given program sequence machine table see flowchart see form rudimentary called set quadruple see
Representations algorithm classed three accepted level Turing machine description For example simple algorithm Add described three level see
Most algorithm intended implemented
However algorithm also implemented mean biological example implementing insect looking food mechanical device
In algorithm basically instance written software software developer effective intended target computer produce given perhaps null
An optimal algorithm even running old hardware would produce faster result higher algorithm purpose running efficient hardware algorithm like computer hardware considered technology
The notion simplicity elegance appears informally Knuth precisely Chaitin Chaitin preface definition I show ca prove program proof would solve ibid
For given function multiple algorithm may exist
This true even without expanding available instruction set available programmer
Rogers observes It


important distinguish notion
procedure notion
mapping yielded procedure
The function may several different algorithm
Unfortunately may tradeoff goodness speed elegance compactness elegant program may take step complete computation one le elegant
An example us Euclid algorithm appears
A computer human computor restricted type machine discrete deterministic mechanical device blindly follows instruction
Melzak Lambek primitive model reduced notion four element discrete distinguishable ii discrete indistinguishable iii agent iv list instruction relative capability agent
Minsky describes congenial variation Lambek abacus model Very Simple Bases
proceeds sequentially five six depending one count instruction unless either conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO change program flow sequence
Besides HALT Minsky machine includes three replacement substitution operation ZERO

L DECREMENT
L L
Rarely must programmer write code limited instruction set
But Minsky show Melzak Lambek machine four general instruction conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO HALT
Knuth advises reader best way learn algorithm try


immediately take pen paper work example
But simulation execution real thing
The programmer must translate algorithm language execute
Stone give example computing root quadratic equation computor must know take square root
If algorithm effective must provide set rule extracting square root
This mean programmer must know language effective relative target computing agent
But model used simulation
Van Emde Boas observes even base abstract instead concrete machine arbitrariness choice model remains
It point notion enters
When speed measured instruction set matter
For example subprogram Euclid algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster programmer instruction available rather subtraction worse Minsky decrement
Per algorithm computed model known per Minsky demonstration Turing completeness requires four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT
Kemeny Kurtz observe undisciplined use unconditional GOTOs conditional GOTOs result programmer write structured program using instruction hand also possible hard write badly structured program structured language
Tausworthe augments three SEQUENCE two CASE
An additional benefit structured program lends using
The graphical aide called offer way describe document algorithm computer program one
Like program flow Minsky machine flowchart always start top page proceeds
Its primary symbol four directed arrow showing program flow rectangle SEQUENCE GOTO diamond dot
The canonical structure made primitive shape

One simplest algorithm find largest number list number random order
Finding solution requires looking every number list
From follows simple algorithm stated description English prose Written prose much closer language computer program following formal coding algorithm algorithm compute GCD two number appears Proposition II Book VII Elementary Number Theory
Euclid pose problem thus Given two number prime one another find greatest common measure
He defines A number multitude composed unit counting number positive integer including zero
To measure place shorter measuring length successively time along longer length remaining portion le shorter length
In modern word remainder quotient remainder modulus part left division
For Euclid method succeed starting length must satisfy two requirement length must zero AND ii subtraction must proper test must guarantee smaller two number subtracted larger alternately two equal subtraction yield zero
Euclid original proof add third requirement two length must prime one another
Euclid stipulated could construct proof two number common measure fact
While Nicomachus algorithm Euclid number prime one another yield number common measure
So precise following really Nicomachus algorithm
Only instruction required execute Euclid logical test conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement subtraction
The following algorithm framed Knuth version Euclid Nicomachus rather using division find remainder us successive subtraction shorter length remaining length le
The description shown boldface adapted Knuth Until remaining length R le shorter length S repeatedly subtract measuring number S remaining length EITHER last measure exact remainder R zero program halt OR ii algorithm must continue last measure left remainder R le measuring number The nut Euclid algorithm
Use remainder measure previously smaller number L serf temporary location
The following version Euclid algorithm requires six core instruction thirteen required Inelegant worse Inelegant requires instruction
The flowchart Elegant found top article
In unstructured Basic language step numbered instruction assignment instruction symbolized
The following version used Object Oriented language In place outer Euclid loop Elegant shift back forth two A B loop computes A A B B A loop computes B B A
This work last minuend M le equal subtrahend S Difference Minuend Subtrahend minuend become new measuring length subtrahend become new length measured word sense subtraction revers
Does algorithm author want
A test case usually suffice confirm core functionality
One source us
Knuth suggested
Another interesting case two number
But exceptional case must identified tested
Will Inelegant perform properly R S S R R S
Ditto Elegant B A A B A B
Yes
What happens one number zero number zero
Inelegant computes forever case Elegant computes forever A
What happens number entered
Fractional number
If input number
function computed include positive integer including zero failure zero indicate algorithm program rather
A notable failure due exception rocket failure June
Knuth demonstrates application extended version Euclid algorithm proposes general method applicable proving validity algorithm
Tausworthe proposes measure complexity program length correctness proof
With six core instruction Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant thirteen instruction
However Inelegant arrives HALT fewer step
indicates case Elegant conditional test every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant one
As algorithm usually requires many much time wasted B
test needed remainder computed
Once programmer judge program fit effective computes function intended question becomes improved
The compactness Inelegant improved elimination five step
But Chaitin proved compacting algorithm automated generalized algorithm rather done exhaustive search example found trial error cleverness insight application etc
Observe step repeated step
Comparison Elegant provides hint step together step eliminated
This reduces number core instruction thirteen eight make elegant Elegant nine step
The speed Elegant improved moving
test outside two subtraction loop
This change call addition three instruction B A GOTO
Now Elegant computes faster whether always case given A B R S would require detailed analysis
It frequently important know much particular resource time storage theoretically required given algorithm
Methods developed obtain quantitative answer estimate example sorting algorithm time requirement O using length list
At time algorithm need remember two value largest number found far current position input list
Therefore said space requirement space required store input number counted O counted
Different algorithm may complete task different set instruction le time space others
For example algorithm cost O log n outperforms sequential search cost O n used sorted list array
The discipline often practiced abstractly without use specific implementation
In sense algorithm analysis resembles mathematical discipline focus underlying property algorithm specific particular implementation
Usually used analysis simplest general representation
However ultimately algorithm usually implemented particular hardware software platform eventually put test using real code
For solution one problem efficiency particular algorithm may significant consequence unless n extremely large algorithm designed fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may critical
Scaling small n large n frequently expose inefficient algorithm otherwise benign
Empirical testing useful may uncover unexpected interaction affect performance
may used compare potential improvement algorithm program optimization
To illustrate potential improvement possible even well established algorithm recent significant innovation relating algorithm used heavily field image processing decrease processing time time application like medical imaging
In general speed improvement depend special property problem common practical application
Speedups magnitude enable computing device make extensive use image processing like digital camera medical equipment consume le power
There various way classify algorithm merit
One way classify algorithm implementation mean
Another way classifying algorithm design methodology paradigm
There certain number paradigm different
Furthermore category include many different type algorithm
Some common paradigm For specific classification algorithm algorithm problem may fall one general category described well one following Every field science problem need efficient algorithm
Related problem one field often studied together
Some example class algorithm
Fields tend overlap algorithm advance one field may improve sometimes completely unrelated field
For example dynamic programming invented optimization resource consumption industry used solving broad range problem many field
Algorithms classified amount time need complete compared input size Some problem may multiple algorithm differing complexity problem might algorithm known efficient algorithm
There also mapping problem problem
Owing found suitable classify problem instead algorithm equivalence class based complexity best possible algorithm
The adjective continuous applied word algorithm mean Algorithms usually patentable
In United States claim consisting solely simple manipulation abstract concept number signal constitute process USPTO hence algorithm patentable
However practical application algorithm sometimes patentable
For example application simple algorithm aid curing deemed patentable
The highly controversial highly criticized patent involving algorithm especially algorithm

After year performed successful transition planned economy
Along change China healthcare system also experienced significant reform follow adapt historical revolution
In data released MoH indicated national expenditure billion totally accounted nationwide gross domestic product
Before entire healthcare cost covered central government annual budget
Since construct supporter started change gradually
Most expenditure contributed health insurance scheme private spending corresponded total expenditure respectively
Meanwhile financially governmental contribution decreased
On hand healthcare facility recorded statistic summary MoH average clinical bed per people mentioned well
Along development information technology since healthcare provider realised information could generate significant benefit improve service computerised case data instance gaining information directing patient care assessing best patient care specific clinical condition
Therefore substantial resource collected build China health informatics system
Most resource arranged construct HIS aimed minimise unnecessary waste repetition subsequently promote efficiency healthcare
By China successfully spread HIS approximately nationwide hospital
However dispersion HIS varies critically
In east part China hospital constructed HIS northwest China equivalent
Moreover CDC rural level approximately healthcare organisation rural level hospital town level ability perform transmission report epidemic situation public health information system analysis infectious disease dynamic statistic
China four tier healthcare system

In tier national hospital governed Ministry Health
China greatly improving health informatics since finally opened door outside world joined World Trade Organization WTO
In reported China medical institution majority clinic
The reason clinic prevention center Chinese people like using traditional Chinese medicine opposed Western medicine usually work minor case
China also improving higher education regard health informatics
At end medical university medical college
There university medical college offered bachelor master doctorate degree medicine
There higher medical specialty institution offered diploma degree total higher medical educational institution
Since joining WTO China working hard improve education system bring international standard
SARS played large role China quickly improving healthcare system
Back outbreak SARS made China hurry spread HIS Hospital Information System hospital HIS
China comparing Korea healthcare system figuring better system
There study done surveyed six hospital China HIS
The result doctor use computer much concluded used much clinical practice administrative purpose
The survey asked hospital created website concluded four created website three company create one created hospital staff
In conclusion agreed strongly agreed providing health information Internet utilized
Collected information different time different participant system could frequently lead issue misunderstanding
To design system healthcare provider realised certain standard basis sharing information interoperability however system lacking standard would large impediment interfere improvement corresponding information system
Given standardisation health informatics depends authority standardisation event must involved government subsequently relevant funding support critical
In Ministry Health released Development National Health Informatics indicating identification standardisation health informatics adoption international standard development national standard
In China establishment standardisation initially facilitated development vocabulary conducive reserve transmit information premium management national level
By domestic standard vocabulary classification coding served hospital information system
In revision International Statistical Classification Diseases Related Health Problems adopted standard diagnostic classification acute care procedure classification
Simultaneously ICPC translated tested China local applied environment
Another coding standard named LOINC applied serve general identifier clinical observation hospital
Personal identifier code widely employed different information system involving name sex nationality family relationship educational level job occupation

By What event power outage
Exactly deal power outage depend long power problem find
This section provides procedure use fairly simple case power long enough outlast UPS unit server provides little info longer power outage
The majority computer Sitterson run switched power grid using orange wall socket
The rest mostly server amount backup power
The department switched power grid automatically switched significant power fluctuation
This prevents damage would otherwise likely occur power allowed flicker
To get power back system conditioned power must switch back main utility room
Instructions given step must precede turning power
Before switch clean power back must first verify power Sitterson back stable server system
To verify power check office light
If come power
To verify stable call Physical Plant ask
After hour switched University Police
Ask stable check Physical Plant
To verify important system go
In particular check see bristol charlotte
Then check PC server big blue computer cabinet make sure
If system running power outage long enough take server case one person able handle thing
If system shut need call troop least one PC admin one UNIX admin assistance
You proceed turn clean power get server
In case also put preliminary sign exterior door saying power went long enough outlast UPSs bring server
Once verified power Sitterson stable server turn switched power
The best way contact UNC Facilities hour Campus Police ask electrician dispatched reset grid
They within minute
But need reset unlock lock box remove key labeled Mech Room use unlock
Instructions resetting breaker north wall
Once switched grid back computer network switch around building start coming back
At point need check make sure thing came okay
Check office PC see able see system Network Neighborhood
If DNS DHCP working fine
Log UNIX machine verify see home directory
If least one AFS server okay
Run
This report network device
Don worry experimental network indicated output device report go indicated network closet power cycle device
This normally fix
Check telephone make sure working okay
If call David Musick phone outside Sitterson
If thing come use judgment call
The last thing let people know status system
Post note post sign exterior door information sure include date time made sign name
Depending working may reasonable go around building inform anyone status operation
Obviously lot thing go wrong usually power going first place
Use best judgment call help call notify Computer Science

As happened August blackout
A system cable electrical power distributed throughout region
The time take process occur information updated real time computer science The time take process computer control occur
Before Activity With Students In activity gather information occurred August northeastern Canada
You take one following role another might imagine record event journal unfolding Internet If class classroom blog see New York Times article idea free registration required access news article
The class combine account weave together story blackout present form play screenplay script movie video tape
Observing To get scene read much August blackout
Start news article listed References section find others Internet
Do limit article however
Learn much research good playwright director actor
To make sure event drama follow logical progression use newspaper account work timeline moment power go New York City restored
Thinking As research think question Writing You structure play couple different way
It structure one scene simply follows another real connection scene
Or structure perhaps built around play role every scene move action along unites action image suggests meaning without stating directly
A police officer might good central character police officer could conceivably play role many different scene logically interact many different character
A central motif might object passed character character drama like cell phone represents communication bicycle represents transportation
A central theme might resourcefulness different way people react emotionally normal routine disrupted
A good way unify drama might demonstrate random act kindness performed character individual way
See References section resource tip writing skit play screenplay
Since Internet link news article quickly become outdated keyword search current article entering one term blackout power outage August northeast power outage Google News tab
As alternate class activity assign student different role type people might find blackout
Have write essay expressing opinion blackout
Conclude student read story entire class
Assessment Use question reinforce basic concept introduced Observing activity
Activity Embedded Assessment During Thinking discussion test student understanding event grasp timeline detail make play interesting
Assessment The student journal play demonstrate understanding concept

If area experience frequent blackout recommend purchasing computer essential equipment help prevent damage corruption
After power outage uncommon computer protected experience problem able boot power
If computer powering blackout follow step


A also called loss particular area
There many cause power failure electricity network
Examples cause include fault damage part system overloading electricity main
Power failure particularly critical site environment public safety risk
Institutions plant shelter like usually backup power source automatically start electrical power lost
Other critical system also required emergency power
The telephone exchange usually array backup also socket connecting generator extended period outage
Power outage categorized three different phenomenon relating duration effect outage In power generation electrical load demand must close equal every second avoid overloading network component severely damage
used automatically detect overload disconnect circuit risk damage
Under certain condition network component shutting cause current fluctuation neighboring segment network leading larger section network
This may range building block entire city entire
Modern power system designed resistant sort cascading failure may unavoidable see
Moreover since economic benefit preventing rare failure researcher expressed concern tendency erode resilience network time corrected major failure occurs
In publication Carreras claimed reducing likelihood small outage increase likelihood larger one
In case economic benefit keeping individual customer happy increase likelihood blackout
Computer system electronic device containing logic circuitry susceptible data loss hardware damage caused sudden loss power
These include data networking equipment video projector alarm system well computer
To protect computer system use provide constant flow electricity primary power supply becomes unavailable short period time
To protect surge event voltage increase second damage hardware power restored special device called absorbs excess voltage used
Restoring power outage difficult power station need brought back
Normally done help power rest grid
In total absence grid power need performed power grid operation
The mean depend greatly local circumstance operational policy typically utility establish localized island progressively coupled together
To maintain supply frequency within tolerable limit process demand must reconnected pace generation restored requiring close coordination power station transmission distribution organization
It argued basis computer modeling
These system exhibit unavoidable disturbance size size entire system
This phenomenon attributed steadily increasing economics running power company limit modern engineering
While blackout frequency shown reduced operating critical point generally economically feasible causing provider increase average load time upgrade le often resulting grid moving closer critical point
Conversely system past critical point experience many blackout leading upgrade moving back critical point
The term critical point system used sense statistical physic nonlinear dynamic representing point system undergoes phase transition case transition steady reliable grid cascading failure sporadic unreliable grid common cascading failure
Near critical point relationship blackout frequency size follows distribution
Other leader dismissive system theory conclude blackout inevitable agree basic operation grid must changed
The champion use feature power control device employing coordinate grid
Others advocate greater use electronically controlled HVDC firebreak prevent disturbance cascading across AC line
becomes much common close critical point
The relationship seen historical data model system
The practice operating system much closer maximum capacity lead magnified effect random unavoidable disturbance due aging weather human interaction etc
While near critical point failure greater effect surrounding component due individual component carrying larger load
This result larger load failing component redistributed larger quantity across system making likely additional component directly affected disturbance fail igniting costly dangerous cascading failure
These initial disturbance causing blackout unexpected unavoidable due action power supplier prevent obvious disturbance cutting back tree separating line windy area replacing aging component etc
The complexity power grid often make initial cause blackout extremely hard identify
In researcher ORNL Power System Engineering Research Center PSerc proposed mathematical model behavior electrical distribution system
This model become known OPA model reference name author institution
OPA cascading failure model
Other cascading failure model include Manchester Hidden failure CASCADE Branching
The effect trying mitigate cascading failure near critical point economically feasible fashion often shown beneficial often even detrimental
Four mitigation method tested using blackout model In addition finding mitigation strategy relationship regard frequency small large blackout total number blackout event significantly reduced mitigation measure
A complex model control large blackout proposed Motter
One proposed solution proposed reduce impact power outage introduced Saleh
Utilities measured three specific performance measure

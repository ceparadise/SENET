Integral differential calculus set mental tool use solve problem world
It easy dismiss irrelevant learning problem book entirely divorced reality plenty application
Reasoning algorithm performance say primary purpose computer science find way use unexpected way job
You know saying hammer everything look like nail
It true enough good luck hammering bolt
The integral differential calculus set good wrench applicable every job absolutely necessary one designed
I totally agree example I make presentation example integral calculus used computer engineering could I talk
The time I recall seeing used CS undergrad algorithm course
We used approximation series hard work approximation probability
Those us expected course since integral continuous version series easy find event whose probability nasty
The sort probability approximation used applied probability class numerous place
If look CLRS Algorithm Design textbook algorithm data structure I sure see I talking
Especially look section approximation algorithm problem performance different hash scheme
All could put heading us theoretical CS
It probably least useful compared discrete mathematics algebra logic field
But many application integral calculus especially computer graphic lighting raytracing physic engine basically force represenatations based calculus also computer vision
notation try describe function scale compared input size grows use lot stuff found calculus like comparing function using limit derivative etc
Some advanced method use integral calculus example
Integral calculus also often used probabilistic algorithm analysis le often approximation algorithm
In used analyze asymptotic behavior mathematical appear analysis substantially different size
It generalization assumes equal size
It depends sort work
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
For application science certain type engineering used daily basis
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
One example I think top head calculating total cost carrying inventory
Let say estimated cost per unit per day essentially use integral determine total cost inventory period time
But right business application require explicit use calculus
I sure accurate I always viewed calculus necessary order force certain level mathematical maturity
If handle handle discrete math linear algebra IMO relevant
It foundation I guess
Summations crop algorithm analysis I ca remember using integral solve CS problem
Fouier series transform laplace transform use integral basis signal processing analysis heat transfer
The precise value math constant computer language provide summing large range
Pi e An integral curve give area bound respect ax
And many application lazy Knowing turn function polynomial function computer compute
Continuous time Markov chain important application improving performance analysis computer network devising better routing algorithm
Integral calculus used calculate probability density function continuous random variable Markov chain

On hand substantially higher seen method since case new enhanced functionality possible way implement scale system would implementing another silo
Reusing subsystem create another functionality possible
also known process system integration system interconnected remaining subsystem
When observed perspective subsystem integrated connection reminiscent star overall diagram system presented connection look like spaghetti hence name method
The cost varies interface subsystem exporting
In case subsystem exporting heterogeneous proprietary interface integration cost substantially rise
Time cost needed integrate system increase exponentially adding additional subsystem
From feature perspective method often seems preferable due extreme flexibility reuse functionality
ESB integration method specialized subsystem dedicated communication subsystem
This allows cutting number connection interface one per subsystem connect directly ESB
The ESB capable translating interface another interface
This allows cutting cost integration provides extreme flexibility
With system integrated using method possible completely replace one subsystem another subsystem provides similar functionality export different interface completely transparent rest subsystem
The action required implement new interface ESB new subsystem
The horizontal scheme misleading however thought cost intermediate data transformation cost shifting responsibility business logic avoided
A integration method avoid every adapter every application format EAI system usually stipulate common data format

In comment Quaternary answer make distinction direct indirect application clear exactly distinction making
Following area computer science applicable

Computer algebra system compute integral derivative directly either symbolically numerically blatant example addition software simulates physical system based continuous differential equation computational fluid dynamic necessarily involves computing derivative integral

The behavior combinatorial algorithm large instance often easily analyzed using calculus
This especially true randomized algorithm modern probability theory heavily analytic
In direction sometimes one design algorithm discrete problem considering continuous analogue using calculus solve continuous problem discretizing obtain algorithm original problem
The simplest example might finding approximate root polynomial equation using calculus one formulate Newton method discretize

Sometimes way get handle enumeration problem form generating function use analytic method estimate asymptotic behavior
See book Flajolet Sedgewick
The book analytic combinatorics demonstrates analyze running time algorithm looking pole related complex function
There bunch approximation algorithm approximation ratio rational number
Such number often arrived optimum continuous function limit
The notorious probably arrived surprising number way
The max cut algorithm http also approximation ratio optimum function
Factor revealing LP model worst case instance given size
As instance size go infinity optimal LP solution sometimes approach continuous function
A toy example would Section I sure others one I familiar I coauthor paper
In stochastic simulation often interested estimating expected value random variable
The expected value continuous random variable integral real number
To estimate quantity use Monte Carlo method consists generating instance random variable pseudorandom uniform variable

Exploring trend development project management today By John Goodpasture It often possible foresee future activity project consistent detail entire period project
Therefore planning often done wave stage activity near term planned detail activity longer distance time left future detail planning
There may fact several planning wave particularly precise approach resource requirement dependent conditioned activity
Such planning approach commonly called rolling wave planning
The fact distinguishing characteristic planning done future wave cost account network task long large compared counterpart
We already discussed long task discussion
Project manager substitute word large cost account long task statistical discussion apply except principle technique applied cost account network schedule
Whether Monte Carlo analysis WBS cost network schedule longer task larger work package greater variance
The summation schedule outcome milestone summation WBS cost top WBS normal distributed outcome regardless rolling wave
However Monte Carlo simulation show intuitively know longer task larger cost account comparatively larger variance increase standard deviation Normal distribution flatten curve stretch tail
As subsequent wave come detail added overall variance decrease Normal distribution outcome variable whether cost schedule become sharply defined tail le extreme standard deviation provides project manager entrée confidence table meaningful
There body knowledge schedule resource planning grown since Eliyahu Goldratt wrote Critical Chain arguably one significant book project management
In book written like novel rather textbook Goldratt applies project management business theory developed earlier managing production operation manufacturing environment
Those theory collectively called Theory Constraints
As applied project management Goldratt asserts problem modern project management ineffective management critical path resource necessary ensure successful critical path unwittingly deliberately scattered hidden project
In Theory Constraints described another Goldratt business novel The Goal idea put forward systemic chain operation always one operation constrains limit throughput entire chain
Throughput generally thought product produced operation value customer
If chain operation stable subject many random error constraint stable identifiable word constraint situational move around one job session batch run next
To optimise operation Goldratt recommends capacity constraint increased constraint removed process redesign activity ahead constraint operated manner constraint never starved
Also activity ahead constraint never work harder faster productively minimum necessary keep constraint starved
Some may recognise latter point plank supply chain mantra fact bad way look Goldratt main point identify manage constraint optimally
When Goldratt carried idea project management identified project constraint critical path
By association Goldratt mean project constrained certain duration constrained duration made shorter
The consequence critical path constrained throughput valuable deliverable project sponsor increased indeed throughput endangered critical path properly managed
Goldratt made several recommendation book Critical Chain prominent We already discussed Goldratt point project buffer earlier discussion represent project schedule risk calculated network project sponsor business value date set programme milestone
We call buffer discussion intent purpose
Figure illustrates placement buffer critical chain planning
The critical chain idea somewhat controversial project management community though lack derivative text paper project lesson learned practitioner critical chain promoter
The controversy arises following point Whether engaged project first time seasoned pro useful overview project management encompasses
Pareto Analysis rule enables see percent case causing percent problem project

Project collaboration tool trend insight New technology revelation behavioral science changing culture generating exciting change world
In blog take dive five concept creating buzz project management community important difference making project work today
Planning process planning project wave phase project proceeds rather completing detailed plan entire project begin
The concept based realisation much detailed planning outset project wasteful
Imagine planning every work item project involves people naïve think would possible let alone successful
Planning dependent speculation plan quickly plan become obsolete condition project change
In Planning build plan time detail project become clearer
Planning becoming default approach stay project management world
The concept Lean Agile based best practice product development project management developing year
The goal Lean Agile maximize efficiency increase maintain perceived customer value le work
Despite around decade concept list buzzword past year modern behavioral science explain Lean Agile effective create empowerment engagement among collaborator
Key component Lean Agile include The one execute work one planning
People great brain lot capacity
If plan together find better way working computer program expert planner
If work workflow visible everyone project manager control without need command
The result transparent reinforces accountability enables individual initiative
The theoretical framework project management focused triangle
Reducing project three component suggests project mechanical system optimized software tool add resource project finish sooner
But practice know really work
Today project management academic practitioner moving towards defining project success delivery perceived customer value
After project stakeholder one get decide value actually mean
If stakeholder think project deliverable high value meet expectation project success
This called project management continuously engaging stakeholder
No matter optimize time cost quality customer service provide every day increase perceived value project
Our view invite stakeholder project team make visible team member see engagement team foster discussion purpose project deliverable
Collaborative technology make level transparency possible
It may make project manager nervous research show invite stakeholder project successful
New technology creating culture information sharing feedback transparency previously existed physical world
In behavioral science explained Osmotic Communication Ambient Awareness commonly known eavesdropping
say work open office hear discussion problem
You realize help human wired need help share contribute feedback
Now technology enable observe participate conversation happening around virtual world
Tools Activity Streams Projectplace applying technology project management effective collaborative way working communicating
In past year learned human brain human specie previous year
A scientific revolution occurred
second We know people learn
How people motivated
How shape efficient behaviour team
And critical creating perceived customer value coordination commitment succeed project
In society seeing final stage understanding human nature
Behavioral science meeting neuro science coming understand importance new technology related way organize work
We learned All organization exist provide value creating sustaining human relation As human being made collaboration We born altruistic need belong help share Management shaping behavior way succeeding project There turning back traditional view project management
In future project management theory best practice even based human available
And even labeled social ever
Five new project buzzword need know

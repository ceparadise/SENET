Risk identification need match type assessment required support decision making
For acquisition program first step identify program goal objective thus fostering common understanding across team needed program success
This give context bound scope risk identified assessed
There multiple source risk
For risk identification project team review program scope cost estimate schedule include evaluation critical path technical maturity key performance parameter performance challenge stakeholder expectation current plan external internal dependency implementation challenge integration interoperability supportability vulnerability ability handle threat cost deviation test event expectation safety security
In addition historical data similar project stakeholder interview risk list provide valuable insight area consideration risk
Risk identification iterative process
As program progress information gained program specific design risk statement adjusted reflect current understanding
New risk identified project progress life cycle
Understand operational nature capability supporting risk end user mission operation capability
Understanding operational see topic Systems Engineering Guide help appreciate gravity risk impact could end user
This critical part risk impact occur risk arises operational use
Typically operational user willing accept level risk able accomplish mission mission assurance need help user understand risk accepting ass option balance alternative available
Work leverage industry academia understand technology considered effort likely transition technology time
One approach work vendor agreement understand capability going risk assessed
NDI includes item
To manage risk consider viability NDI provider
Does provider market share
Does provider appropriate longevity compared competitor
How provider address capability problem release fix etc
What user base particular NDI
Can provider demonstrate NDI preferably setting similar customer
Can government use NDI create prototype
All factor help ass risk viability NDI provider
Seek answer question MITRE staff worked area used NDI assessed
Emphasize critical capability enablers particularly limited alternative
Evaluate determine primary driver acquisition emphasize associated risk formulating risk mitigation recommendation
If particular aspect capability critical success risk assessed need primary focus risk management
For example risk proposed user interface marketplace numerous alternative success proposed approach probably le critical overall success capability
On hand information security feature likely critical
If one alternative approach satisfies need emphasis placed
Determine primary success driver evaluating need design determining alternative exist
Is unique solution critical path success
Make sure critical path analysis include entire system engineering cycle development system development per se may piece cake fielding active operational situation may major risk
If particular requirement driving implementation capability high risk due unique development performance need requirement discussed user criticality
It may need could postponed development community ass might satisfied future
Help user developer gauge much risk schedule cost impact particular capability assume requirement receive le risky capability sooner
In developing recommendation consider technical feasibility knowledge related implementation success failure ass risk implementing instead future
In deferring capability take care fall trap postponing ultimate failure trading easy success future multiple requirement may essential overall success
Work closely user establish KPPs
Overall risk program cancelation centered failure meet KPPs
Work user ensure parameter responsive mission need technically feasible
The parameter lenient easily met meet mission need stringent met without extensive effort pushing put program risk
Seek result past operation experiment performance assessment industry implementation help determine performance feasibility
Having enterprise perspective help acquirer program manager developer integrator user appreciate risk dependency development effort
With emergence approach program become dependent availability operation service provided others intend use program development effort
Work developer service ensure quality service created thought put maintenance evolution service
Work development program staff ass service available quality risk program using relying upon service
Likewise risk associated creating service using service another enterprise effort
Help determine risk potential benefit creating service internal development possibly transition enterprise service future time
I I almost always major risk factor
They form dependency value integrating interoperating judged override inherent risk
Techniques enterprise federation architecting composable capability demand design pattern help government plan execute route navigate I I risk
Refer section Systems Engineering Guide article technique addressing I I associated risk
Information security risk nearly every development
Some due uniqueness government need requirement area
Some inherent difficulty countering cyber attack
Creating defensive capability cover spectrum attack challenging risky
Help government develop resiliency approach contingency plan etc
Enabling information sharing across system coalition operation international partner present technical challenge policy issue translate development risk
The information security issue associated supply chain management broad complex even maintaining rudimentary awareness threat tremendous challenge
The skill experience level developer integrator government stakeholder lead risk
Be lookout insufficient skill reach across corporation fill gap
In help educate government team member time bringing corporate skill experience bear
Programs typically create government cost estimate considers risk
As develop refine program technical risk associated cost estimate evolve well
Cost estimation activity
Historical information similar government program provide valuable insight future risk
Seek information operational challenge risk various operation lesson learned action report exercise summary experimentation result
Customers often repository access
Government leader normally communicate strategic need challenge
Understand factor assessment important capability needed customer basis risk assessment
Historical data help ass risk frequently available past performance assessment lesson learned acquisition program contractor

A protocol writing risk statement construct
This protocol applies risk management process designed almost environment
It recognition risk nature probabilistic one occurs unwanted consequence
What construct
The reflects known today
It root cause identified risk event
Thus event occurred presently occurring occur certainty
Risk event future event may occur present
Below illustration protocol
The risk event associated present
It critically important recognize dual
When examined jointly may way directly intervene remedy risk event underlying root consequence event occurs longer threaten project
The probabilistic portion risk statement
The consequence set consequence impact engineering system project risk event occurs
An example construct illustrated Figure
The culture government project program discourages identification risk
This may arise risk management activity tracking monitoring mitigating risk seen burdensome unhelpful
In situation useful talk team benefit identifying risk inability manage head determine priority need involved mitigation action
Assist government team executing process balance management investment value outcome project
In general good balance achieved project scope schedule cost target met successfully mitigated action plan project team belief risk management activity provide value project
representation risk identified individual strictly system engineering team review source risk
Organizational cultural political environmental factor stakeholder support organizational priority pose much risk project technical factor alone
These risk identified actively mitigated throughout life project
Mitigation activity could include monitoring legislative mandate emergency change might affect program project mission organizational change could affect user requirement capability usefulness change political support could affect funding
In case consider risk program identify action option discussion stakeholder
For additional information see article
Projects program usually multiple stakeholder bring various dimension risk outcome
They include operator might overwhelmed new system user might properly trained fear job supervisor might support new capability appears diminish authority policy maker concerned legislative approval cost
In addition important include stakeholder certification accreditation authority inadvertently overlooked pose major risk later program
Stakeholders may keenly aware various environmental factor pending legislation political program support pose risk project unknown government MITRE project team
Include stakeholder risk identification process help surface risk
Using format help communicate evaluate risk statement develop mitigation strategy
The root cause underlying introduced risk design approach might cause reflects probability probability assessment portion risk statement occur communicates impact program increased resource support testing additional schedule concern meet performance
The mitigation strategy almost always better based clearly articulated risk statement
It common risk statement refined team evaluates impact
When assessing documenting potential risk impact cost schedule technical timeframe understanding statement risk might change
For example assessing risk impact software schedule slip risk statement might refined include date clarification impact xyz software delivered March sufficient time test interface exchange prior Limited User Test
Be careful fall trap mitigation statement introduced risk statement
A risk uncertainty potential negative impact
Some jump quickly conclusion mitigation risk instead identifying risk mitigated mitigation option identified identify risk design approach
For example risk statement might If contractor use XYZ test test fail
The concern really test sufficiency
If contractor conduct test measurable result analysis program may pas limited user test
Use XYZ may mitigation option reduce test sufficiency risk
A risk may refined changed given analysis might affect mitigation may
Engineers often jump solution best move next step discussed article decompose understand problem first
Ultimately lead strategy closely aligned concern

A really anything computer may damage steal data allow someone else access computer without knowledge consent
There lot different thing create computer risk including general term used describe many type bad software
We commonly think computer virus several type bad software create computer security risk including virus worm ransomware spyware Trojan horse
Misconfiguration computer product well unsafe computing habit also pose risk
Let look detail
malware attached file system may used destroy data
Viruses many capability unlike worm usually require human interaction spread system system even user unaware spreading
like virus ability spread computer computer
They know attach portable storage device like USB drive removable hard drive move network automatically moving connected machine
relatively new term malware installed system make file unreadable holding data hostage pay hacker ransom
Ransomware may delivered virus worm guarantee even pay ransom get data restored
malware steal data may used spy using webcam microphone without knowledge
Once spyware installed may steal sensitive data recording login information use looking sensitive file computer sending data back attacker
In recent month hacker able access webcam microphone computer use picture video audio recording blackmail victim
special kind virus
Like famed wooden horse used Greeks infiltrate walled city Troy Trojan horse virus used deliver type malware hiding inside program file look legitimate
Most operating system today come sort firewall many tool normally referred protection suite protect computer
These suite tool usually incorporate different tool help defend risk mentioned far
Get FREE access day create account
These item work properly configured
Improper incomplete configuration product may create computer security risk
For example program need updated regularly
As new virus released software need updated block new virus attempt infect computer
If misconfigured may get required update put computer risk
This hold true operating system well
Microsoft example release security patch fix every Tuesday
These patch fix part operating system working designed contain new functionality protect new threat discovered operating system
If system patched mean new vulnerability available hacker creates computer security risk
We probably heard click link email unknown source
As tool gotten smarter attacker find new way infecting computer
may able block software installed automatically voluntarily install infected software may catch
Clicking link unknown untrusted source installing software loaned given u without proper licensing security procedure downloading software source official vendor could lead computer infected malware data stolen hacker
These unsafe computing habit create computer security risk
A anything may cause damage confidentiality integrity availability data
Computer security risk created bad software infect computer destroy file steal data allow attacker gain access system without knowledge authorization
Examples malware include virus worm ransomware spyware Trojan horse
Misconfigured software unpatched operating system unsafe computer habit contribute creating computer security risk

The InConsult Team integral making lasting significant improvement Thrifty internal control Our Framework comprehensive effectively embeds assessment management control risk The service support InConsult InConsult expertise risk management insurance APRA prudential framework allowed u improve risk management framework successfully meet regulator Engaging InConsult undertake project implementation review proved excellent choice
The knowledge experience consultant made whole process Whilst SWOT Analysis good fast way discover new opportunity identify threat many organisation gone beyond relatively simple approach embraced advanced form identifying assessing risk opportunity
The move many organisation adopt Risk Management ERM approach directed organisation towards structured approach identifying managing risk
In context Tony Harb InConsult explores various risk identification assessment approach organisation choose
Did know whole standard dedicated risk assessment technique
supporting standard ISO Risk management Principles guideline provides guidance select apply systematic technique risk assessment
It contains around separate technique cross
It critical manager know knowing technique help better align risk assessment process risk assessment objective
Brainstorming involves group people working together identify potential risk cause failure mode hazard criterion decision option treatment
Brainstorming stimulate encourage conversation amongst group knowledgeable people without criticising rewarding idea
During structured interview interviewee asked set prepared question encourage interviewee present perspective thus identify risk
Structured interview frequently used consultation key stakeholder designing risk management framework
As example structured interview good gauge risk appetite tolerance developing risk appetite statement
Checklists list hazard risk control failure developed usually experience either result previous risk assessment result past failure incident
Auditors often prepare checklist key control aid assessment control effectiveness internal control environment
We strongly recommend risk checklist used secondary form risk control identification
Relying entirely checklist restrict risk thinking
Remember back year used look back math book answer attempting solve bit like
This systematic team based exercise facilitator utilises set prompt word phrase stimulate participant identify risk
One organisation looking reducing service level number area reduce operating cost SWIFT used analyse impact reduced service level
Risks identified assessed
Where risk could reduced tolerable level service level maintained
Closely related SWIFT
Here scenario short story description situation future event event might turn look like
For scenario participant reflect analyse potential consequence potential cause analysing risk
Scenario analysis used identify opportunity fraud
For example scenario could A staff member admitted defrauding company year fictitious expense happen This method similar form creative thinking called reverse brainstorming
This technique used identifying analysing factor contribute specified undesired event called top event
Causal factor identified organized logical manner represented pictorially tree diagram
For example want improve customer service state objective reverse
How really annoy customer statement use brainstorming identify cause could annoy customer
They say picture worth thousand word method perfect example
Bow tie analysis diagrammatic way describing linking analysing pathway risk cause
Unlike risk register number analysis
risk control evaluation involved
This keep focus understanding relationship cause event consequence
After brainstorming session bow tie analysis great way clean idea generated consolidate result appropriate risk statement
Simply looking risk situationally aware included risk identification technique
This relatively simple technique used daily workplace staff may observe risky situation hazard regularly
It also used emergency service attending emergency form dynamic risk assessment
It also heavily used Workplace Health Safety professional inspection audit
A risk aware culture well trained staff improve people ability observe potential risk implement control risk eventuates incident
Incidents risk occurred
Recording incident register conducting root cause analysis periodically running trend analysis report analyse incident potentially enable new risk identified
In addition high frequency like incident lead risk indicator potentially larger problem
This method also included risk identification technique however similar structured interview involves larger number people
It used collect broad set idea thought opinion across range area covering risk control effectiveness
One best way risk manager use survey ass organisation risk culture
Internal auditor use survey ass internal control environment
Some organisation use annual staff survey gauge staff understanding key risk governance policy procedure
So know different time leave comfort zone try something new

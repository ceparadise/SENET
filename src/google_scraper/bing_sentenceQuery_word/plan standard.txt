realization application execution idea
In implementation realization algorithm
Many implementation may exist given specification standard
For example contain implementation specification software development tool contain implementation
A special case occurs implement case concrete class interface includes method specified interface
In implementation refers process guiding client purchase use software hardware purchased
This includes requirement analysis scope analysis customizations system integration user policy user training delivery
These step often overseen project manager using methodology
Software Implementations involve several professional relatively new knowledge based economy project manager
To implement system successfully large number task need carried appropriate sequence
Utilising implementation methodology enlisting professional advice help often number task poor planning inadequate resourcing cause problem implementation project rather task particularly difficult
Similarly cultural issue often lack adequate consultation communication inhibits achievement desired result
In implementation refers carrying
pas law carried working
This process consists
Factors impacting implementation include legislative intent administrative capacity implementing bureaucracy interest group activity opposition presidential executive support
In international relation implementation refers stage international
It represents stage international provision enacted domestically legislation regulation
The implementation stage different ratification international treaty
Implementation defined specified set activity designed put practice activity program known dimension
According definition implementation process purposeful described sufficient detail independent observer detect presence strength specific set activity related implementation
In addition activity program implemented described sufficient detail independent observer detect presence strength
In water natural resource implementation refers actualization best management practice ultimate goal conserving natural resource improving quality water body
System implementation generally benefit high level user involvement management support
User participation design operation information system several positive result
First user heavily involved system design move opportunity mold system according priority business requirement opportunity control outcome
Second likely react positively change process
Incorporating user knowledge expertise lead better solution
The relationship user information system specialist traditionally problem area information system implementation effort
Users information system specialist tend different background interest priority
This referred communication gap
These difference lead divergent organizational loyalty approach problem solving vocabulary
Examples difference concern

A group nonprofit educator want student even kindergartner know fundamental
More job knowledge computer work
Not start one surf web actually run simplest series input lead series particular output
Yet across United States child taught even
It discipline left largely YouTube watcher kid lucky enough born family resource
According Google Gallup half student attend school offer dedicated class
Black student le likely white peer access course teacher parent likely tell boy would good computer science girl
That technical worker company like Google Apple Facebook white male surprise
But group nonprofit educator tech company state district want change
And year work carefully crafted yet adaptable framework education look like grade level went live week
The writer hope help state craft standard ultimately bring subject classroom across country
The response history inequity computer science said Pat Yongpradit chief academic officer one organization steering initiative
People different motivation participating
Some wanted make sure state strong pipeline worker fill local tech job
Others think basic coding reading writing skillset American student need posse
And still others hope creating framework help roll back mindset computer science select begin diversify largely white male space
Yongpradit see computer science literacy modern Right many people use dating apps idea algorithm could literally help meet future spouse work pointed
It hard understand talk around mean without basic understanding server added
Equipping young people fundamental understanding computer science provide richer experience citizen modern age said
According group involved first time people across spectrum come together broad task
Perhaps contrary discipline teacher exactly clamoring someone tell teach educator background computer science state district seem welcoming input
Mark Saunders director Office Technology Virtual Learning Virginia Department Education one handful state actively working develop standard
The state plan use framework basis standard
It bigger preparing student potential job Saunders said
At core computer science computational thinking computational thinking algorithmic process key skill every student use lot different profession everyday And framework help state teacher particularly elementary level computer science likely integrated day framed class think teach concept
Most concept even require computer learn early stage said Rebecca Dovi director education Virginia nonprofit CodeVA work teacher student improve education
At recent camp Dovi whose group reviewed framework said team worked programming concept essentially hinge cheer routine group young girl planning fun
On piece paper girl drew symbol describe different movement
Two line clap
A dot foot stomp
Then learned could use symbol describe routine paper
That algorithmic Dovi said necessarily needing States nonprofit like Dovi working train teacher teach computer science
But general acknowledgement lack savvy among asked teach subject state work standard curriculum present significant hurdle
I think low supply right Saunders said
While number state including Virginia nonprofit provide teacher training existing teacher still pathway state certification teacher
Yongpradit pointed new teacher come prepared teach computer science pipeline still sparse
There also acknowledged challenge losing teacher highly qualified teach computer science tech industry salary often higher
Some district offer signing bonus certain teacher generally pretty small
But Leigh Ann DeLyser national director education research characterized idea teacher likely leave classroom teacher complete And last six month said around teacher city trained teach basic computer science
One trickier challenge getting parent broadly community board idea computer science everyone
For many year education broadly codified AP course level
There assumption DeLyser said student special smarter She hope framework help change
But work
According survey whopping percent parent say see computer science good use resource percent told teacher school official feel way
And parent often cite lack interest subject key reason woman underrepresented computer science yet perhaps unconsciously le likely tell girl would good
Saunders Virginia Education Department also said counselor may likely think student high math aptitude succeed computer science think limited view
Sepi Hejazi Moghadam head research development education Google support new framework find mindset concerning mask fact real difference access encouragement school home creating gap
It kind suggesting higher representation motivated said
Moghadam think school principal beginning look incorporating computational skill lesson though hope framework accelerate pace
That framework developed something minor miracle given writer hundred people periphery offering different opinion
They always agree
DeLyser one framework writer said instance technical thing routing protocol included early simplified pointed minute detail necessarily thing every child need know
But framework computer science maybe moment emphasis maybe even people want desperately happen say early tell
Last year every student opportunity learn computer science
He called federal government approve funding state make goal reality
The nation new education law name computer science core subject writing
And last several year Yongpradit said definitely wave activity federal state Arkansas Indiana Florida made major push level major city like New York Chicago
California toward standard
So Virginia South Carolina Washington state
What designing necessarily ideal
Activists think state focused cranking programmer instead teaching every student think computationally
But ultimately said Dovi CodeVA framework chance show teacher introduce every child every grade level computer science
We really beautiful opportunity really disrupt inequity place said
That hope draw student select conversation lesson big data cybersecurity privacy critical issue today child grapple adult
We said For animal sleep universal incredibly varied
The president tweet recent protest misleading dangerous protester
The protest rattled Iran weekend many way echo near past
In summer took street protest reelection President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad whose rhetoric policy isolated country four year
The opposition believed reelection victory fraudulent
They chanted slogan demanding recount vote
Others denounced regime highest authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei
Hardliners security force confronted crowd gear harsh condemnation often labeling agent foreign power
It huge moment seemed time portend irreversible shift geopolitics
Change come easily peacefully soon
Protest movement Middle East face enormous repressive hurdle rarely happy ending
Even protester succeed toppling autocrat rarely succeeded ending autocracy
In Iran obstacle success daunting
Whereas Middle Eastern country ruled secular autocrat focused repressing primarily Islamist opposition Iran Islamist autocracy focused repressing secular opposition
This unorganized leaderless citizen seeking economic dignity pluralism versus heavily armed organized rapacious ruling theocracy espouses recipe success
And yet inauspicious backdrop Iran mushrooming far much smaller scale country unprecedented geographic scope intensity
They began December Mashhad Shiite pilgrimage city often considered regime stronghold protester slogan like leave Syria alone think They soon spread Iran holiest city protester expressed nostalgia Reza Shah modernizing autocrat ruthlessly repressed clergy
They continued provincial town thousand chanting want Islamic Republic death revolutionary guard death dictator
They since spread Tehran hundred BBC reported citing Iranian official
Conservatives warned Obamacare would produce Democratic Waterloo
Their inability accept principle universal coverage instead led defeat
Seven year three day ago House Representatives grumblingly voted approve Senate version Affordable Care Act
Democrats House displeased many change introduced Senate Democrats
But interval Senate passage Republicans gained seat Senate
Any tinkering law could trigger Republican filibuster
Rather lose whole thing House swallowed hard accepted bill liberal regarded giveaway insurance company interest group
The finished law proceeded President Obama signature March
A minute House vote I wrote short blog post website I edited day
The site founded early argue modern moderate form Republicanism
The timing could worse
At precisely moment urging GOP march one direction great mass conservative Republicans turned double toward ever wild even paranoid extremism
Those day Glenn Beck clock Fox News conspiracy rant Sarah Palin death panel Orly Taitz fellow Birthers Tea Party rally men openly brandished assault rifle

You need know much Like Muslims generation Ahmed spent lifetime toggling various aspect identity
She got prom night promising mother go gay guy
She swapped marriage master degree
She even followed band toured story straight Hollywood except Muslim punk group called Kominas

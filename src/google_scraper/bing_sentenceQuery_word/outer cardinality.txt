searching internet seems answer understand
So kindly somebody could explain help example cardinality database
Thank You
A source confusion may use word two different context data modelling database query optimization
In data modelling term cardinality one table relates another
There also optional participation condition row one table relate table
See Wikipedia
When talking database query optimization cardinality refers data column table specifically many unique value
This statistic help planning query optimizing execution plan
See Wikipedia
It depends bit context
Cardinality mean number something get used variety context
There probably situation people talk cardinality using different context mean something else
Cardinality refers uniqueness data contained column
If column lot duplicate data
column store either true false low cardinality value highly unique
Social Security number high cardinality
In database refers set row table
image Cardinality set namber element set set b c th set contain element cardinality set Definition We table database
In relational database relation among table
These relation
These relation called
Significant cardinality Many relational database designed following stick business design database define cardinality based business rule
But every object nature well
When define cardinality among object consider thing define correct cardinality
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

My school book defines cardinality follows The cardinality relation number tuples contains
By contrast number tuples called cardinality relation change tuples added deleted
many tuples tuples
While Wikipedia article defines follows Cardinality refers uniqueness data value contained particular column attribute database table
The lower cardinality duplicated element column
There type cardinality
They might right ca connect two definition related definition
A rephrase would appriciated
They speaking thing tuples row layman term
When say possible value particular attribute field unique therefore number row tuples higher As far unique
In five
On hand normal cardinality particular three unique
Thus
And finally two possible unique tuples thus
You probably confuse relation something number relation table
On hand textbook speaking normally entity relation another entity number possible relation occurences entity participating given relationship type
Thus example could either
Both definition trying say cardinality number row
The difference whether comparison table particular column
The version database text book focus relational algebra structure table relation lingo
The Wikipedia entry practical
It encompasses textbook definition assuming table primary key cardinality primary key table
However applied say flag column well
If flag take two value versus say cardinality column
This important optimizing query
Cardinality one component choosing best method joining aggregating selecting data
In practice database use information cardinality statistic column value optimization
If table A B think cardinality number row table B would related row table A
If table PERSON VEHICLE relation cardinality high person rode lot different vehicle past vehicle drove many person
If relation OWNS cardinality low person one vehicle none vehicle usually one two owner
Note cardinality one side relation equal cardinality side
If table PERSON FINGER relation BELONG TO person many finger finger belongs one person

In context database cardinality refers uniqueness data value contained column
High cardinality mean column contains large percentage totally unique value
Low cardinality mean column contains lot repeat data range
It common cardinality also sometimes refers relationship table
Cardinality table
High cardinality column unique uncommon data value
For example database table store bank account number Account Number column high cardinality definition every item data column totally unique
Normal cardinality column somewhat unique percentage data value
For instance table hold customer information Last Name column would normal cardinality
Not every last name unique example likely several occurrence Smith whole data fairly
Low cardinality column unique value
In customer table low cardinality column would Gender column
This column likely M F range value choose thousand million record table pick one two value column
Cardinality relationship table take form whose reversal
These term simply refer relationship data table
For example relationship Customers table Bank Accounts table one customer several account one account belong one customer
That course assuming bank never heard joint account

What cardinality set regular grammar
The caveat I interested grammar different
Sorry I know talk formal way I mean actual symbol arbitrary
So example grammar x Is equivalent grammar Hopefully I understood
I believe set countable every N finite number production rule formulated
For example x The unique set production rule There least one regular grammar per regular language pairwise inequivalent meaningful equivalence relation
Since least countably infinite number regular lower bound number regular grammar well
Without loss write every regular grammar finite string finite alphabet
Therefore many regular grammar binary string countably infinitely many
Combine bound get answer

I experiencing I think impossibly high cardinality estimate following query The estimated plan
I working statistic copy table I include actual plan
However I think relevant problem
SQL Server estimate row returned dm derived table
It estimate row returned join performed primary key
I would expect join cardinality estimate row
Instead row estimate appears number row I would get cross joining outer inner table
The math work rounding rounded
I primarily looking root cause behavior
I interested simple workarounds well please suggest changing data model using temp table
This query simplification logic within view
I know COALESCE column joining good practice
Part goal question figure I need recommend data model redesigned
I testing Microsoft SQL Server legacy cardinality estimator enabled
TF others
I give full list trace flag end relevant
Here relevant table definition I also anyone want reproduce issue one server
To add observation using TF fix estimate option
TF fix estimate
Removing one table fix estimate
Bizarrely changing join order also fix estimate
By changing join order I mean rewriting query forcing join order hint
Here changing order join
I know column joining good practice
Generating good cardinality distribution estimate hard enough schema key constraint query relational primarily SPJG
The CE model built principle
The feature query closer one get boundary cardinality selectivity framework handle
Go far CE give
Most MCVE example simple SPJ G albeit predominantly outer equijoins modelled inner join plus rather simpler inner equijoin semijoin
All relation key though foreign key constraint
All one join good
The exception outer join
The function join MCVE potentially duplicate row
This sort thing
Simple equality predicate selection scalar operator also better
For example normally work well model
It relatively easy modify histogram frequency statistic reflect application predicate
built turn implemented internally true well appeared language
The CE model two child consisting project selection input relation
Each listed component model support combining relatively straightforward
Even one layer abstraction le accurate end result tends reason larger execution plan tend le stable reliable
hand engine
It built using basic component
Applying effect histogram example simple replacing step value compacting necessary
It still relatively opaque scalar operator go best avoided possible
Nevertheless generally speaking le alternate
The CE complex even SQL Server standard
It case applying simple logic secret formula operator
The CE know key functional dependency know estimate using frequency multivariate statistic histogram absolute ton special case refinement check balance supporting structure
It often estimate
join multiple way frequency histogram decides outcome adjustment based difference two
One last basic thing cover Initial cardinality estimation run every operation query tree bottom
Selectivity cardinality derived leaf operator first base relation
Modified histogram information derived parent operator
The tree go lower quality estimate tends error tend accumulate
This single initial comprehensive estimation provides starting point occurs well consideration given final execution plan happens way even trivial plan compilation stage
The query tree point tends reflect written form query fairly closely though subqueries removed simplification applied etc
Immediately initial estimation SQL Server performs heuristic join reordering loosely speaking try reorder tree place smaller table join first
It also try position inner join outer join cross product
Its capability extensive effort exhaustive consider physical cost since exist yet statistical information metadata information present
Heuristic reorder successful simple inner equijoin tree
It exists provide better starting point optimization
Why join cardinality estimate large
The MCVE unusual join equi join predicate
The operator tree also inner join heuristic join reorder unable move tree preferred position
Leaving aside scalar projection join tree Note faulty final estimate already place
It printed stored internally double precision floating point value decimal
The derived table original query removed projection normalized
A SQL representation tree initial cardinality selectivity estimation performed As aside repeated also present final plan final Compute Scalar inner side inner join
Notice final join
This inner join definition cartesian product preceding join output selection join predicate applied
The cardinality cartesian product simply
To need determine apply selectivity predicate
The combination opaque expanded tree term remember together impact key information derived histogram frequency earlier unusual outer join combined mean CE unable derive acceptable estimate normal way
As result enters Guess Logic
The guess logic moderately complex layer educated guess educated guess algorithm tried
If better basis guess found model us guess last resort equality comparison fixed selectivity guess The result selectivity cartesian product mentioned
When problematic join better estimate produced guess last resort avoided key information retained join
The quality estimate still join predicate
The revised estimate least reasonable human I suppose
When query written outer join heuristic reorder able swap final inner join
Putting inner join right next outer join give limited ability early reorder opportunity improve final estimate since effect unusual outer join come tricky selectivity estimation
Again estimate little better fixed guess probably would stand determined court law
Reordering mixture inner outer join hard even stage full optimization attempt limited subset theoretical move
The nested suggested Max Vernon answer manages avoid fixed guess final estimate improbable zero row uplifted one row decency
This might well fixed guess row statistical basis calculation
I would expect join cardinality estimate row
This reasonable expectation even one accepts cardinality estimation occur different time optimization physically different logically semantically identical subtrees final plan sort best best per memo group
The lack consistency guarantee mean individual join able flout respectability I get
On hand end guess hope already lost bother
We tried trick knew gave
If nothing else wild final estimate great warning sign everything went well inside CE compilation optimization query
When I tried MCVE CE produced zero row final estimate like nested original query unacceptable way thinking
The real solution probably involves design change allow simple without ideally foreign key constraint useful query compilation
I believe operator resulting joined root cause issue
Historically compute scalar difficult cost accurately
Since provided minimally complete verifiable example thanks
accurate stats I able rewrite query join longer requires functionality expanded resulting much accurate row estimate While technically required since join null value I included since clearly portrays intent
Plan Plan The new query benefit
parallelization
Also note new query estimate output number row may fact worse end day estimate original query
The subtree cost select operator new query come original clock clearly le
Having said I believe first estimate anywhere close reality
Addendum
After consultation various people spurred discussion Lamak seems observational query performs terribly even parallelism
A solution allows good performance good cardinality estimate consists replacing transformed statement cover query optimizer
As cardinality estimator harder time discovering reliable statistic column buried inside
intrinsic function much open cardinality estimator
It also worth nothing optimized away target known
The plan variant look like Paste The Plan version
FYI prop great Plan Explorer I used produce graphical plan
As per join condition table arrange many manner changing one particular manner fix result
Suppose joining one table give correct result
Here place use either
Therefore purpose rest table clear
It like break table part
Most probably Ideally contain equal amount row
But one table contain undesired number row
Sorry I wrong

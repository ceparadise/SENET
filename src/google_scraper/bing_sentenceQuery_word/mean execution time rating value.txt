In time program running contrast
A error detected execution running state program whereas error detected program ever executed
code optimization typically done compile time may done run time depending particular language compiler
When program executed first performs necessary setup link program need execution begin starting program
In case language implementation task done language runtime instead though unusual mainstream language common consumer operating system
Some program debugging performed efficient accurate performed runtime
bound checking example
For reason programming discovered program tested real data despite sophisticated checking testing
In case end user may encounter message
one language feature designed handle runtime error providing structured way catch completely unexpected situation well predictable error unusual result without amount inline error checking required language without
More recent advancement runtime engine enable provides debug information every exception interest implemented independent source code attaching special software product runtime engine

In storage location identified paired associated contains known unknown quantity information referred
The variable name usual way stored value addition referring variable depending context
This separation name content allows name used independently exact information represents
The identifier computer value variable may thus change course
Variables programming may directly correspond concept
The latter reference physical object storage location
The value computing variable necessarily part mathematics
Variables computer programming frequently given long name make relatively descriptive use whereas variable mathematics often terse name brevity transcription manipulation
A variable storage location may referred several different identifier situation known
Assigning value variable using one identifier change value accessed identifier
replace variable symbolic name actual location data
While variable name type location often remain fixed data stored location may changed program execution
In value generally time
In variable expression keep single value entire due requirement
In imperative language behavior exhibited named symbolic constant typically contrasted normal variable
Depending programming language variable may able store specified

Alternatively datatype may associated current value allowing single variable store anything supported programming language
An identifier referencing variable used access variable order read value alter value edit variable access permission etc
For instance variable might referenced identifier variable contain number
If variable referenced identifier well using identifier value variable altered reading value using identifier yield result
If variable referenced single identifier simply called
Otherwise speak
For instance previous example name variable question another name variable
The variable describes program text variable may used describes program execution variable meaningful value
The scope variable actually property name variable extent property variable
These confused also called property program varies point source code execution see
Further may coincide variable lifetime many case tied variable lifetime
A variable name affect
important part variable
Most language define specific variable well named entity may differ within given program
The scope variable portion program code variable name meaning variable said visible
Entrance scope typically begin variable lifetime come context exit scope typically end lifetime go context
For instance variable meaningful within certain finely within block accordingly static resolution performable
Alternatively variable resolved based global binding stack depends specific control flow
Variables accessible within certain function termed
A one indefinite scope may referred anywhere program
hand runtime aspect variable
Each variable value runtime
The extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer value memory location
A running program may enter leave given extent many time case
Unless programming language feature variable whose extent permanently outlasts scope result whereby memory allocated variable never freed since variable would used reference deallocation purpose longer accessible
However permissible variable binding extend beyond scope occurs Lisp C execution pass back variable scope variable may used
A variable whose scope begin extent said often undefined arbitrary value accessed see since yet explicitly given particular value
A variable whose extent end scope may become deemed uninitialized since value destroyed
Variables described previous two case may said
In many language error try use value variable extent
In language may yield
Such variable may however assigned new value give new extent
For space efficiency memory space needed variable may allocated variable first used freed longer needed
A variable needed scope thus beginning variable lifetime enters scope may give space unused variable
To avoid wasting space compiler often warn programmer variable declared used
It considered good programming practice make scope variable narrow feasible different part program accidentally interact modifying variable
Doing also prevents
Common technique different section program use different make individual variable private either
Many programming language employ reserved value often named indicate invalid uninitialized variable
In language variable also meaning certain kind value stored
For example variable type prohibited storing text value
In language value variable carry type
In situation exist simultaneously A variable given type undeclared assumed universal exists compile time
Values also type checked queried runtime
Typing variable also allows resolved compile time
However different polymorphism used function call referred resolve call based value type opposed supertypes variable allowed
Variables often store simple data like integer literal string programming language allow variable store value well
Such language may also enable function
These function operate like variable represent data multiple type
For example function named may determine length list
Such function may parametric polymorphic including type variable since amount element list independent element type
The function also referred variable
For instance code segment variable named given value function called
The integer give value
In language function parameter local scope
This specific variable named referred within function though course function also variable called
The specific variable allocation representation value vary widely among programming language among implementation given language
Many language implementation allocate space whose extent last single function call whose memory automatically reclaimed function return
More generally name variable bound address particular block contiguous sequence byte memory operation variable manipulate block
common variable whose value large unknown size code compiled
Such variable reference location value instead storing value allocated pool memory called
Bound variable value
A value however abstraction idea implementation value represented stored somewhere computer memory
The program must set aside memory data object since memory finite ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable value
Objects allocated heap must object longer needed
In language runtime environment automatically reclaims object extant variable longer refer
In language program programmer must explicitly memory later free reclaim memory
Failure lead heap depleted program run risk eventual failure exhausting available memory
When variable refers created dynamically component may indirectly accessed variable
In circumstance garbage collector analogous program feature language lack garbage collector must deal case portion memory reachable variable need reclaimed
Unlike mathematical counterpart programming variable constant commonly take name

name commonly used auxiliary variable instance variable
Some naming convention enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifier
In almost language variable name start digit contain whitespace character
Whether punctuation mark permitted variable name varies language language many language permit variable name forbid punctuation
In programming language specific often punctuation character known prefixed appended variable identifier indicate variable type
variable name also varies language language require use certain case naming certain entity Most modern language older language
Some language reserve certain form variable name internal use many language name beginning two underscore often fall category
However beyond basic restriction imposed language naming variable largely matter style
At level variable name used exact name chosen matter computer
Thus name variable identify rest tool programmer make program easier write understand
Using poorly chosen variable name make code difficult review name name clear often encouraged
Programmers often create adhere code style guideline offer guidance naming variable impose precise naming scheme
Shorter name faster type le descriptive longer name often make program easier read purpose variable easier understand
However extreme verbosity variable name also lead le comprehensible code

Computer program use data type organise different type data program
Data also constant variable within program function
In program
If value variable changed program user
When program run data value held whilst worked
Data value stay every time program known constant
Constants expected change
actual value fixed
An example might character string hello world
The data value hello world fixed code
value name defined used literal constant
An example might stating level game always referred
Examples constant within game might Variables data value change user asked question example age
Variables may change program execution
A variable
It name associated location
The memory location used hold data
The key difference comparing constant variable value associated variable name may change program execution
For example would need variable change throughout game
The content organisation computer memory fixed neither value pointed variable
When data read variable content memory location copied used calculation

Variables act storage location data program
They way naming information later usage
Each variable example variable name use
To store information variable write command using equal sign following way Thus end program value value value

What difference asynchronous synchronous execution
When execute something synchronously wait finish moving another task
When execute something asynchronously move another task finish
That said context computer translates executing process task another thread
A thread series command block code exists unit work
The operating system manage multiple thread assign thread piece slice processor time switching another thread give turn work
At core pardon pun processor simply execute command concept two thing one time
The operating system simulates allocating slice time different thread
Now introduce multiple mix thing CAN actually happen time
The operating system allocate time one thread first processor allocate block time another thread different processor
All allowing operating system manage completion task go code thing
Asynchronous programming complicated topic semantics thing tie together time
There numerous article book subject look
Synchronous mean connected dependent way
In word two synchronous task must aware one another one task must execute way dependent wait start task completed
Asynchronous mean totally independent neither one must consider way either initiation execution
Synchronous one thread Synchronous Asynchronous one thread Asynchronous Technically concept really
Although general unusual find asynchronous task running thread possible see example find two task executing synchronously thread No concept whether second subsequent task initiated first task completed whether must wait
That
What thread thread process CPUs indeed hardware task executed relevant
Indeed make point I edited graphic show
ASYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
In solving many engineering problem software designed split overall problem multiple individual task execute asynchronously
Inverting matrix finite element analysis problem good example
In computing sorting list example
The quick sort routine example split list two list sort calling recursively
In example two task often executed asynchronously
They need separate thread
Even machine one CPU one thread execution coded initiate processing second task first one completed
The criterion
As long start end time task overlap possible output neither needed input executed asynchronously matter many thread use
SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
Any process consisting multiple task task must executed sequence one must executed another machine Fetch update data get stock quote financial service etc
If separate machine separate thread whether synchronous asynchronous
In simpler term SYNCHRONOUS You queue get movie ticket
You get one everybody front get one applies people queued behind
ASYNCHRONOUS You restaurant many people
You order food
Other people also order food wait food cooked served order
In kitchen restaurant worker continuously cooking serving taking order
People get food served soon cooked
I try explain simply I hopefully remember My bos busy man
He tell write code
I tell Fine
I get started watching like vulture standing behind shoulder
I like Dude WTF go something I finish
like No I finish
This synchronous
The bos tell rather waiting right work bos go task
When I finish job I simply report bos say I DONE
This Asynchronous Execution
It really simple
Hope help
Take advice NEVER work bos behind
mean execution happens single series

If calling routine run finish start finish start etc
With begin routine let run background start next point say wait finish
It like finish The advantage execute still running background separate thread take better advantage resource fewer hang wait
Synchronous mean caller wait response completion asynchronous caller continues response come later applicable
As example This always ouput But make doSomething asynchronous multiple way output become Because method making asynchronous call would immediately continue next line code
I say could order execution ca guaranteed asynch operation
It could also execute original depending thread timing etc
I think bit explanation still clarifies using real life example
Small Example Let say playing audio involves three step If audio player step sequentially every song synchronous
You wait time hear song till song actually get fetched decompressed
If audio player step independent asynchronous
ie
While playing audio step fetch audio harddisk parallel step decompresses audio parallel
step You end hearing song without waiting much fetch decompress
In nutshell synchronization refers two process point
In example Process A endpoint synchronized Process B start point Asynchronous process hand start endpoint synchronized Where Process A overlap Process B running concurrently dictionary definition hence confusion
It might helpful think term asynchronous synchronous instead asynchronous synchronous
Simply said asynchronous execution stuff background
For example want download file internet might use synchronous function block thread file finished downloading
This make application unresponsive user input
Instead could download file background using asynchronous method
In case download function return immediately program execution continues normally
All download operation done background program notified finished
When executing sequence like b c get failure middle execution like Then beginning synchronous If however sequence execute b c failure middle instead restarting beginning point failure know asynchronous
You confusing Synchronous Parallel v Series
Synchronous mean time
Syncronized mean related othere mean series fixed interval
While program running series
Get dictionary unsweet tea
You tea sweetened tea
Synchronous basically mean execute one thing time
Asynchronous mean execute multiple thing time finish executing current thing order move next one
As really simple example Imagine school student instructed walk queue road
The student got shoelace untied
Now stopped tying
All student behind stopped waiting get tied
The student walked past continuing usual pace
Just Imagine random people walking road
They queue course randomly walking different place road different pace
person shoelace got untied
She stopped get tied
But nobody waiting get tied
Everyone else still walking way pace
A synchronous operation work returning caller
An asynchronous operation work returning caller
When task executed synchronously wait task completed moving another task
One task depends end another When task executed asynchronously directly switch another task previous completed
One task depend
In programming task executed
It necessary understand several thread created task order avoid stacking single queue
That said concept synchronous asynchronous much thread reason I mention rare see task running asynchronously single thread although technically possible
In regard definition synchronous execution sometimes confusing good way understand Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Computer science quickly becoming essential skill nearly every industry
Whether looking create animation JavaScript design website HTML CSS tutorial help get order

In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO
ontology considered upper ontology used linguistic tool learning domain ontology
The ontology example combination upper domain ontology
A survey ontology visualization technique presented Katifori et al
The established ontology visualization technique namely indented tree graph evaluated Fu et al
A visual language ontology represented specified
also called ontology building set task related development ontology particular domain
It subfield study ontology development process ontology life cycle method methodology building ontology tool language support
Ontology engineering aim make explicit knowledge contained software application organizational procedure particular domain
Ontology engineering offer direction overcoming semantic obstacle related definition business term software class
Known challenge ontology engineering include application designed assist creation manipulation
They often express ontology one many
Some provide export ontology language however
Among relevant criterion choosing ontology editor degree editor abstract actual used visual navigation possibility within
Next come facility support etc
Another important feature ability import export foreign language
Ontologies developed specific purpose application
Ontology learning automatic creation ontology including extracting domain term natural language text
As building ontology manually extremely time consuming great motivation automate process
Information extraction text mining explored automatically link ontology document example context BioCreative challenge
An used encode ontology
There number language ontology proprietary The coordinate attempt converge different ontology worldwide
The development ontology Web led emergence service providing list directory ontology search facility
Such directory called ontology library
The following library ontology
The following directory search engine
They include crawler searching Web ontology
In general ontology used beneficially several field

study computer including design architecture us computation system control
The field includes engineering activity design computer hardware make computer system
It also theoretical mathematical activity design performance study system component mean technique like queueing theory estimation reliability availability system probabilistic technique
Since computer system often large complicated allow designer predict failure success without testing experimentation incorporated development cycle
Computer generally considered separate computer engineering although two overlap extensively area design study computer system
The major subdisciplines computer science traditionally architecture including level hardware design well hardware software component form computer system software program set instruction tell computer carry task subdivided software engineering programming language operating system information system database artificial intelligence computer graphic theory includes computational method one hand data structure
Computer science independent discipline date although electronic object study invented two decade earlier
The root computer science lie primarily related field electrical engineering mathematics
provides basic circuit idea electrical impulse input circuit combined produce arbitrary output
The transistor miniaturization circuit along invention electronic magnetic optical medium storage information resulted advance electrical engineering
source one key concept development idea information represented sequence zero one
In number represented sequence binary digit way number familiar decimal system represented using digit
The relative ease two state high low voltage realized electrical electronic device led naturally bit becoming basic unit data storage transmission
The developed century supplied designing circuit binary input value false true respectively terminology logic yield desired combination output
Theoretical work computability began provided needed extension design whole machine milestone specification theoretical device manipulates string British mathematician model computational power
Another breakthrough concept computer usually credited mathematician
This instruction well data stored fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited calculator approach instruction entered one time
The need user application provided main driving force early day computer science still great extent today
The difficulty writing program led first development allows programmer use instruction ADD symbol variable
Such program translated program known assembler binary encoding used computer
Other piece system software known linking loader combine piece assembled load machine main memory unit ready execution
The concept linking separate piece code important since allowed library program built carry common first step toward increasingly emphasized notion software reuse
Assembly language found sufficiently inconvenient language closer natural language invented easier faster programming along came need compiler program translate language program machine code
As programming language became powerful abstract building efficient compiler create code term execution speed storage became interesting computer science problem
Increasing use computer early provided development consist software automatically handle input output execution job
The historical development operating system summarized topic
Throughout history computer machine utilized two major application computational support scientific engineering discipline data processing business need
The demand better computational technique led resurgence interest numerical method area mathematics traced method devised several century ago physicist hand computation made validate theory
Improved method computation obvious potential revolutionize business conducted pursuit business application new information system developed consisted file record stored
The invention allows rapid access arbitrary record disk led cleverly designed file system also concept development sophisticated database management system commonly use
development optimal algorithm inserting deleting locating data major area theoretical computer science since beginning heavy use structure virtually computer compiler operating system file system
Another goal computer science creation machine capable carrying task typically thought requiring
goal known actually predates first electronic computer although term coined introduced early display data crude image paper plot CRT screen
Expensive hardware limited availability software kept field growing early computer memory required became affordable
A bit map binary representation main memory rectangular array point pixel picture element screen
Because first display used one binary bit per pixel capable displaying one two colour commonly black green black amber
Later computer memory assigned binary bit per pixel obtain colour
together display screen development graphic standard make software le led explosive growth field
Software engineering arose distinct area study late part attempt introduce discipline structure software design development process
For thorough discussion development computing see
Architecture deal design computer component hardware creation operating system software control computer
Although designing building computer often considered province computer engineering practice exists considerable overlap computer science

From logical vantage point instructive observation offered Dutch Evert Beth independently slightly different form Finnish philosopher Jaakko Hintikka
Both pointed certain proof method Beth called Curry others computer science become branch mathematics
Thus theoretical computer science object study theorem also proof well calculation program algorithm
Theoretical computer science turn close connection investigation idealized computer ramification theory finite automaton mathematical linguistics

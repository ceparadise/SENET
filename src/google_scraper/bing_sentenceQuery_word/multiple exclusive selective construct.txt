three distribution intensity intensive distribution selective distribution exclusive distribution
Then select example product service level distribution intensity
Why think might case
Explain answer
example intensive distribution would apply bottled water convenience product want available everyone everywhere supermarket drug store vending machine etc
Intensive paper towel kleenex milk hot dog etc
Products commonly find variety store put intensive distribution strategy
The product available basically everywhere go grocery store supermarket convenient store dollar store etc
The goal product accessible many
This solution explains product service based optimal distribution intensity
A thorough discussion provided

In property instituted purpose preventing requirement one never enter time another thread execution enters critical section
The requirement mutual exclusion first identified solved seminal paper titled credited first topic study
A simple example mutual exclusion important practice visualized using four item second third removed
The removal node sits node performed changing pointer previous node point next node word node removed pointer node changed point node thereby removing linked list reference node
When linked list shared multiple thread execution two thread execution may attempt remove two different node simultaneously one thread execution changing pointer node point node another thread execution change pointer node point node
Although removal operation complete successfully desired state linked list achieved node remains list pointer node point node
This problem called avoided using requirement mutual exclusion ensure simultaneous update part list occur
The problem mutual exclusion address problem resource sharing software system control multiple process access shared resource process need exclusive control resource work
The solution make shared resource available process specific code segment called
It control access shared resource controlling mutual execution part program resource would used
A successful solution problem must least two property Deadlock freedom expanded implement one property Every process program partitioned four section resulting four state
Program execution cycle four state order If process wish enter critical section must first execute trying section wait acquires access critical section
After process executed critical section finished shared resource need execute exit section release process use
The process return section
There software hardware solution enforcing mutual exclusion
Some different solution discussed
On system simplest solution achieve mutual exclusion disable process critical section
This prevent running effectively preventing process
Although solution effective lead many problem
If critical section long drift every time critical section executed timer interrupt longer serviced tracking time impossible critical section
Also process halt critical section control never returned another process effectively halting entire system
A elegant method achieving mutual exclusion
effective uniprocessor system
The use shared memory instruction provide mutual exclusion
A process location shared memory since operation atomic one process set flag time
Any process unsuccessful setting flag either go task try later release processor another process try later continue loop checking flag successful acquiring
still possible method allows system continue process halt holding lock
Several atomic operation used provide mutual exclusion data structure notable CAS
CAS used achieve mutual exclusion shared data structure creating linked list node represents desired operation performed
CAS used change pointer linked list insertion new node
Only one process successful CAS process attempting add node time try
Each process keep local copy data structure upon traversing linked list perform operation list local copy
Beside solution software solution exist use achieve mutual exclusion
Examples include following These algorithm work used platform executes
Programmers specify strict ordering memory operation within thread
It often preferable use synchronization facility provided operating system multithreading library take advantage hardware solution possible use software solution hardware solution exist
For example operating system library used thread try acquire already acquired lock operating system could suspend thread using swap another thread ready run could put processor low power state thread run
Therefore modern mutual exclusion method attempt reduce using queuing context switch
However time spent suspending thread restoring proven always time must waited thread become ready run blocked particular situation acceptable solution situation
One binary test set register sufficient provide solution mutual exclusion problem
But solution built test set register possibly lead starvation process become caught trying section
In fact distinct memory state required avoid lockout
To avoid unbounded waiting distinct memory state required
Most algorithm mutual exclusion designed assumption failure occurs process running inside critical section
However reality failure may commonplace
For example sudden loss power faulty interconnect might cause process critical section experience unrecoverable error otherwise unable continue
If failure occurs conventional mutual exclusion algorithm may deadlock otherwise fail key liveness property
To deal problem several solution using mechanism proposed
The solution explained used build synchronization primitive Many form mutual exclusion
For example classic permit one process get semaphore another process get second semaphore wait till semaphore released
Other common include process never get sufficient resource run completion higher priority thread wait thread high latency response interrupt prompt
Much research aimed eliminating effect often goal guaranteeing
No perfect scheme known
Blocking system call used sleep entire process
Until call became proper mechanism sleeping single thread within process see

ADVERTISEMENTS It represents level international availability selected particular product marketer level intensity chosen depend upon factor production capacity size target market pricing promotion policy amount product service required
Image Courtesy ADVERTISEMENTS Intensive distribution aim provide saturation coverage market using available outlet
For many product total sale directly linked number outlet used cigarette beer
Intensive distribution usually required customer range acceptable brand choose
In word one brand available customer simply choose another
This alternative involves possible outlet used distribute product
This particularly useful product like soft drink distribution key success factor
Here soft drink firm distribute brand multiple outlet ensure easy availability customer
ADVERTISEMENTS Hence one hand brand available restaurant five star hotel hand also available countless soft drink stall kiosk sweetmarts tea shop
Any possible outlet customer expected visit also outlet soft drink
Selective distribution involves producer using limited number outlet geographical area sell product
An advantage approach producer choose appropriate outlet focus effort training
Selective distribution work best consumer prepared shop around word preference particular brand price search outlet supply
This alternative middle path approach distribution
Here firm selects outlet distribute product
This alternative help focus selling effort manufacturing firm outlet rather dissipating countless marginal one
It also enables firm establish good working relationship channel member
Selective distribution help manufacturer gain optimum market coverage control lesser cost intensive distribution
Both existing new firm known use alternative
Exclusive distribution extreme form selective distribution one wholesaler retailer distributor used specific geographical area
When firm distributes brand one two major outlet market exclusively deal competing brand said firm using exclusive distribution strategy
This common form distribution product brand seek high prestigious image
Typical example designer ware major domestic appliance even automobile
By granting exclusive distribution right manufacturer hope control intermediary price promotion credit inventory service policy
The firm also hope get benefit aggressive selling outlet

output true input differ one true false
It prefix operator operator
The XOR output true input
It gain name exclusive meaning ambiguous true exclusive operator case
This sometimes thought one
This could written A B A B
More generally XOR true odd number input true
A chain XOR XOR XOR true whenever odd number input true false whenever even number input true
The A XOR B show output true whenever input differ Exclusive disjunction essentially mean one none
In word statement true one true false
For example two horse racing one two win race
The exclusive disjunction also denoted expressed term logical logical follows The exclusive disjunction also expressed following way This representation XOR may found useful constructing circuit network one operation small number operation
A proof identity given It sometimes useful write following way This equivalence established applying twice fourth line proof
The exclusive also equivalent negation rule material implication equivalent disjunction negation consequence
In summary mathematical engineering notation Although useful logic system fail generalizable structure following way The system neither
This unfortunately prevents combination two system larger structure
However system using exclusive
The combination operator element produce
This field represent logic obtainable system added benefit arsenal algebraic analysis tool field
More specifically one associate one interpret logical AND operation multiplication XOR operation addition Using basis describe boolean system referred
The Oxford English Dictionary explains either follows The primary function emphasize two thing course secondary function emphasize mutual exclusiveness either two
The explicitly state one neither
However mapping correspondence formal operator natural language conjunction far simple studied decade
Following kind intuition sometimes argued many natural language included word exclusive sense
The pair proposition supposed mean true true
For example might argued normal intention statement like You may coffee may tea stipulate exactly one condition true
Certainly circumstance sentence like example taken forbidding possibility one accepting option
Even good reason suppose sort sentence disjunctive
If know disjunction true overall sure disjuncts true
For example woman told friend either snack bar tennis court validly infer tennis court
But waiter tell may coffee may tea validly infer may tea
Nothing classically thought disjunction property
This even given might reasonably take waiter denied possibility coffee tea
In English construct either usually used indicate exclusive generally used inclusive
But Spanish word used form exclusive form inclusive
Some may contend binary exclusive true odd number true input however reasonable definition example digital xor gate multiple input typically use definition conjunction English general property
For example Barrett Stenner contend article The Myth Exclusive Mind author produced example English appears false input true brush The light bulb either reflecting particular fact world rather nature word
However town shave shaved barber shave barber
would paradoxical could exclusive although purist could say either required statement paradox
Whether example considered natural language another question
Certainly one see menu stating Lunch special sandwich soup salad parsed sandwich soup salad according common usage restaurant trade one would expect permitted order soup salad
Nor would one expect order neither soup salad belies nature special ordering two item together cheaper ordering la carte
Similarly lunch special consisting one meat French fry mashed potato vegetable would consist three item one would form potato
If one wanted meat kind potato one would ask possible substitute second order potato vegetable
And one would expect permitted type potato vegetable result would vegetable plate rather meat plate
The symbol used exclusive disjunction varies one field application next even depends property emphasized given context discussion
In addition abbreviation XOR following symbol may also seen If using value true false work exactly like
Exclusive disjunction often used bitwise operation
Examples As noted since exclusive disjunction identical addition modulo bitwise exclusive disjunction two string identical standard vector addition
In computer science exclusive disjunction several us In logical circuit simple made add number series AND OR NOT gate create carry output
On computer architecture efficient store zero register register bit always zero instead loading storing value zero
In simple threshold activated modeling XOR function requires second layer XOR linearly separable function
sometimes used simple mixing function example system
also heavily used block cipher AES Rijndael Serpent block cipher implementation CBC CFB OFB CTR
Similarly XOR used generating
The XOR operation preserve randomness meaning random bit XORed bit result random bit
Multiple source potentially random data combined using XOR unpredictability output guaranteed least good best individual source
XOR used creating parity information
For example RAID back byte two hard drive XORing mentioned byte resulting writing another drive
Under method one three hard drive lost lost byte XORing byte remaining drive
For instance drive containing lost XORed recover lost byte
XOR also used detect overflow result signed binary arithmetic operation
If leftmost retained bit result infinite number digit left mean overflow occurred
XORing two bit give overflow
XOR used swap two numeric variable computer using however regarded curiosity encouraged practice
leverage XOR property order save space represent data structure
In drawing method often used manage item system without overlay plane

Edited John Mekalanos Harvard Medical School Boston MA approved May received review January Genetic heterozygosity thought enhance resistance host infectious disease test idea exist
In particular heterozygosity MHC highly polymorphic locus control immunological recognition pathogen suspected confer selective advantage enhancing resistance infectious disease heterozygote advantage hypothesis
To test hypothesis released mouse large population enclosure challenged multiple strain one
We found infection three avirulent strain MHC heterozygote greater survival weight homozygote unlike sham control likely clear chronic infection homozygote
In laboratory experiment found MHC heterozygosity enhanced clearance infection
Yet contrary widely assumed benefit heterozygosity due resistance dominant rather overdominant heterozygote resistant average parental homozygote resistant
The fact MHC heterozygote resistant infection higher fitness homozygote provides functional explanation mating preference
The highly polymorphic gene MHC play central role immune recognition pathogen parasite
These gene encode MHC class I II molecule present peptide antigen T cell initiating immune recognition foreign antigen
Heterozygosity MHC locus may enhance resistance infectious disease increasing diversity antigen presented T cell generating diverse T cell repertoire
The evidence heterozygote advantage hypothesis however mixed equivocal
MHC heterozygosity associated resistance infectious disease including effective clearance hepatitis B virus lower viral load among carrier human T cell lymphotropic virus prolonged survival individual
Yet finding correlation may due genetic heterozygosity background locus moreover many population study report association MHC heterozygosity resistance infectious disease
Experimental study laboratory mouse provide evidence MHC heterozygosity increase immune resistance least pathogen tested problem remain unresolved
First host resistance often tested using immunological response pathogen clearance assay study necessarily indicate host survives cope infection
For example one study found heterozygous mouse higher T cell response viral infection homozygote yet heterozygote least likely survive infection
The author suggested high immune responsiveness heterozygote might provide advantage natural infection possibility never tested
Second study tested genotype limiting conclusion made
Third laboratory study usually use congenic strain mouse control effect crossing inbred line produce heterozygote may create incidental heterozygote advantage heterosis spurious effect resulting masking recessive deleterious mutation may accumulate inbred line
Fourth experimental study tested single strain pathogen parasite whereas evidence heterozygote advantage human population genetically polymorphic infection
Thus critical test advantage hypothesis performed
Another problem heterozygote show advantage population study generally interpreted heterozygote superiority overdominance heterozygote assumed higher fitness parental homozygote
Yet heterozygote may selective advantage homozygote average resistance merely dominant heterozygote inherit resistance resistant parental homozygote resistance generally dominant least test single pathogen
Therefore clarity use heterozygote advantage broad sense heterozygote fitness advantage homozygote average like population study may due dominance overdominance use heterozygote superiority overdominance narrow sense heterozygote higher fitness parental homozygote
This distinction meant clarify whether observed heterozygote advantage due resistance overdominant merely dominant
To determine whether heterozygosity MHC locus provides selective advantage infection bred congenic mouse carrying five haplotype produce homozygote heterozygote
We controlled potential confounding effect background mutation could create heterosis using F segregants bred intercrossing heterozygote progeny
We released mouse large population enclosure infected repeatedly period simulated epidemic strain serovar Typhimurium one strain monitored subsequent impact host fitness
To determine influence expression genetic resistance infected mouse monitored pathogen clearance laboratory
Our result indicate provides selective advantage increasing resistance avirulent infection although pattern due resistance dominant rather overdominant
We used strain mouse obtained The Jackson Laboratory
These strain carry five different MHC haplotype whose allele major genetic difference class I II locus
Mice bred housed standard colony condition specific animal facility either pure line F segregants homozygote heterozygote bred crossing F cross congenic strain housed littermates per cage
F segregants using PCR microsatellite marker closely linked MHC
Enclosures housed heated building designed mouse population sterile previously housed wild mouse pathogen parasite probably present
We released mouse population enclosure approximately equal sex ratio equal number mouse average enclosure
The mouse carried different MHC genotype homozygous heterozygous five MHC haplotype
They varied age week old beginning experiment age difference homozygote heterozygote existed
We infected mouse five enclosure mouse five monitored health survival mouse time per week
serovar Typhimurium enteric mouse pathogen becomes systemic invading intestinal mucosa replicating intracellularly within host macrophage
Pathogen clearance pathogenesis depend host genotype strain MHC gene influence clearance avirulent strain
We infected mouse following strain A highly attenuated strain avirulent strain mouse clearance avirulent strain secondary fatal primary infection mouse avirulent heterologous strain carrying recombinant antigen polio virus hepatitis B virus respectively
We used recombinant strain express different epitope thus ensure infection antigenically diverse
intracellular pathogen avirulent mouse although resistance influenced class I T cell response resistance controlled monomorphic MHC locus
We cultured bacteria stored frozen stock ml infusion h shaking
We diluted overnight solution sterile PBS desired concentration verified concentration viable bacteria quantitative plate count
In enclosure population infected mouse orally μl solution withholding food water In laboratory experiment infected mouse interperitoneally using injection per mouse
For infection laboratory infected mouse equal number genotype strain unit cfu per mouse either primary secondary infection mouse genotype equal sex ratio
To test effect MHC heterozygosity secondary immunity first infected mouse attenuated A strain cfu per mouse control mouse time allowed four week bacteria cleared
For infection laboratory tested mouse approximately equal number genotype using pure strain testing F segregant mouse
We infected mouse A strain cfu per mouse week later infected either single strain mixture containing equal number four strain cfu per mouse single mixed infection
We used selective medium Rambach agar confirm mouse infected
To assay pathogen clearance killed infected mouse day infection always controlling duration infection among experimental group dissected homogenized spleen ml PBS sterile condition
We performed serial dilution spleen homogenate cultured μl homogenate selective agar plate incubated overnight
We determined concentration bacteria per spleen pathogen load counting number colony forming unit per milliliter spleen homogenate plate mean two replicate plate per mouse
We also assayed resistance monitoring weight loss mortality sign pathology disfigured hunched back associated cachexia
In enclosure weight provided index health male whereas weight female fluctuated mainly pregnancy
We used nonparametric test analyze survivorship Fisher exact test
Before statistical test checked data assumption normality equality variance transformed nonnormal data used Welch test variance still unequal used nonparametric Wilcoxon test
test used multiple comparison
Data presented mean SEM used test directed test minimize number mouse indicated previous data already showed significance strong trend predicted direction
In enclosure population experimentally infected mouse lower survival control mortality mainly occurring last three virulent infection week Fig

Females significantly higher survival rate male population whereas pattern reversed infected population
Overall survival advantage occurred heterozygote infected population
Yet among mouse died virulent infection week mouse showed advantage homozygote Fig

In contrast heterozygosity conferred survival advantage among mouse died time control population Fig
implies MHC heterozygosity prolonged survival among mouse infected infection avirulent strain
plot showing survivorship mouse experimentally infected mouse mouse population enclosure
Arrows indicate timing infection arrow aroA cfu per mouse arrow cfu per mouse cfu per mouse arrow aroA total cfu per mouse arrow two infection cfu per mouse
Heterozygotes lost survival advantage infected population virulent infection week Fig
even though showed advantage control population time Fig

It unclear virulent infection abolished advantage heterozygosity although two resistance microbe controlled monomorphic MHC locus
In population heterozygote showed survival advantage last week experiment mouse week age
In laboratory condition mouse begin show sign mortality week old
MHC effect become apparent old week age MHC heterozygote show advantage disadvantage
Therefore reduced survival homozygous mouse control population must caused condition population enclosure increased exposure uncontrolled pathogen social stress
We found evidence infection among mouse although mouse showed pathological symptom disease
We also found heterozygous mouse healthy homozygote avirulent epidemic
In infected population male gained significantly weight homozygote first two epidemic
This result necessarily due experimental infection however
Uninfected heterozygous mouse laboratory condition show weight gain advantage see heterozygote population showed significant advantage time
This finding suggests MHC heterozygosity may provided advantage uncontrolled pathogen control another nonmutually exclusive possibility increased weight heterozygote result heterosis
We tested possibility examining weight F segregants found among F segregants MHC heterozygote gained significantly weight homozygote infected population control population Fig

Thus controlled potential difference due background gene MHC heterozygote still weight advantage experimental infection
We monitored pregnancy status female found infected population MHC heterozygote twice likely become pregnant Fig
pregnancy homozygote infected control although difference significant
Health reproduction mouse population enclosure
Changes body weight male virulent epidemic F segregants infected control
Reproduction female infected population control data shown
Mice end experiment experimental population still infected completely cleared infection
Finally found mouse better able resolve infection homozygote
At end experiment found nearly half mouse treatment population still infected
This unexpected laboratory condition mouse usually clear strain within month month since last experimental infection
MHC heterozygote significantly likely completely cleared infection homozygote Fig

This result indicates MHC heterozygosity enhances ability mouse clear chronic infection stressful social condition
To determine whether protective effect MHC heterozygosity enclosure caused enhancing resistance infection whether resistance dominant overdominant conducted additional experiment laboratory
In first experiment tested resistance mouse single strain either primary secondary challenge administered week primary infection attenuated strain enclosure
Two week infection determined pathogen load mouse found MHC genotype infection type primary secondary significant effect pathogen load Fig

resistance showed dominant rather overdominant pattern resistance
Heterozygotes lower pathogen load homozygote especially secondary infection however difference significant primary secondary challenge
Differences resistance among homozygote magnified secondary infection MHC genotype significant effect pathogen load secondary primary infection
This result consistent study study showing vaccine protect MHC genotype may detectable level T cell response epitope found secondary primary infection
Therefore tested resistance MHC heterozygote secondary infection subsequent experiment
Resistance mouse laboratory
Pathogen load mouse infected single strain either primary secondary challenge
Heterozygotes significantly resistant homozygote primary power least significant number secondary infection power least significant number
Pathogen load mouse infected secondary challenge single multiple strain
On average heterozygote significantly resistant homozygote infection infection
Resistance F segregant mouse secondary challenge multiple strain
MHC genotype significant influence pathogen load weight
On average mouse lower pathogen load lost le weight infection homozygote
In second laboratory experiment tested resistance homozygous mouse infection
After challenging mouse attenuated A strain infected secondary challenge mixture four strain control infected dosage using larger sample size mouse time
MHC genotype significant effect pathogen load infection Fig

Again mouse showed dominant rather overdominant pattern resistance
Heterozygotes significantly resistant susceptible parental genotype never resistant parental homozygote
On average MHC heterozygote significantly lower bacterial load homozygote infection
In third laboratory experiment tested resistance mouse infection using F segregant mouse rule possible confounding effect heterosis caused background gene
We infected mouse four different strain week later found MHC heterozygote significantly lower pathogen load lost le weight infection homozygote Fig

Again found significant evidence heterozygote superiority
Heterozygotes le likely show pathological disease symptom disfigured hunched back homozygote le likely either parental homozygote although trend significant
We found overdominance pattern preliminary experiment using pure line congenic mouse strain although trend statistically significant even result two experiment pooled
This experiment indicates MHC heterozygote resistant secondary infection homozygote rule possibility benefit heterozygosity artifact crossing different congenic strain mouse heterosis
Our result indicate MHC heterozygosity confers selective advantage avirulent infection
In population enclosure MHC heterozygosity slightly enhanced health survival mouse avirulent infection different strain enhanced clearance chronic infection
Heterozygotes showed survival advantage control population final week experiment may due enhancing resistance various uncontrolled pathogen enclosure
In laboratory MHC heterozygote resistant infection homozygote
This pattern found genotypic combination tested could attributed heterosis masking background mutation may accumulated mouse
Although MHC heterozygote resistant homozygote average found significant evidence heterozygote superiority
MHC heterozygote resistant homozygote average never significantly resistant resistant parental homozygote
Our finding suggest association MHC heterozygosity disease resistance population study could due dominance rather overdominance contrary generally assumed
Heterozygote superiority might emerge special circumstance even would occur overdominance seems insufficient explain evolution MHC polymorphism
Only one population genetic model concludes overdominant selection maintain MHC polymorphism result requires unlikely assumption heterozygous genotype equal fitness
More realistic model indicate overdominance maintain allele
On hand heterozygosity MHC locus increase resistance infectious disease wild finding could explain male high reproductive success macaque increased antler development deer sexually attractive odor stickleback fish
Furthermore heterozygote advantage could explain adaptive function mating preference mouse human behavior capable driving unusual diversity MHC allele

In meant implement concept specifically field
A graph data structure consists finite possibly mutable together set unordered pair vertex undirected graph set ordered pair directed graph
These pair known undirected graph directed graph
The vertex may part graph structure may external entity represented integer index
A graph data structure may also associate edge symbolic label numeric attribute cost capacity length etc
The basic operation provided graph data structure usually include Structures associate value edge usually also provide Different data structure representation graph used practice The following table give cost performing various operation graph representation number vertex number edge
In matrix representation entry encode cost following edge
The cost edge present assumed
Adjacency list generally preferred efficiently represent
An adjacency matrix preferred graph dense number edge close number vertex squared one must able quickly look edge connecting two vertex

A graphical representation flow data modelling aspect
A DFD often used preliminary step create overview system without going great detail later elaborated
DFDs also used structured design
A DFD show kind information input output system data advance system data stored
It show information process timing whether process operate sequence parallel unlike traditional structured focus control flow UML activity workflow diagram present control data flow unified model
In original developer structured design proposed data flow diagram practical technique based Martin Estrin Data Flow Graph model computation
Data flow diagram DFD quickly became popular way visualize major step data involved software system process
DFDs usually used show data flow computer system although could theory applied
DFDs useful document major data flow explore new design term data flow
Data flow diagram also known bubble chart
DFD designing tool used approach Systems Design
This DFD next exploded produce Level DFD show detail system modeled
The Level DFD show system divided process deal one data flow external agent together provide functionality system whole
It also identifies internal data store must present order system job show flow data various part system
Data flow diagram one three essential perspective analysis design method
The sponsor project end user need briefed consulted throughout stage system evolution
With data flow diagram user able visualize system operate system accomplish system implemented
The old system data flow diagram drawn compared new system data flow diagram draw comparison implement efficient system
Data flow diagram used provide end user physical idea data input ultimately effect upon structure whole system order dispatch report
How system developed determined data flow diagram model
In course developing set data flow diagram forced address system may decomposed component identify
Data flow diagram used Analysis Design phase
There different notation draw data flow diagram Yourdon Coad defining different visual representation process data store data flow external entity
A logical DFD capture data flow necessary system operate
It describes process undertaken data required produced process store needed hold data
On hand physical DFD show system actually implemented either moment Current Physical DFD designer intends future Required Physical DFD
Thus Physical DFD may used describe set data item appear piece paper move around office fact particular set piece paper stored together filing cabinet
It quite possible Physical DFD include reference data duplicated redundant data store implemented set would constitute relational database
In contrast Logical DFD attempt capture data flow aspect system form neither redundancy duplication

Is difference data dependence graph data dependency graph
I seen term sometimes used interchangeably sometimes
To make thing even complicated data dependency graph sometimes also called data flow graph see

The term data dependence graph example used second slide
If difference could someone give example graph type
If difference two different term
interchangeable term
In experience common
In writing I try consistently use without aesthetic reason I think sound better
If look dictionary see two word synonym
The difference I aware mean something specific field political science mean territory controlled owned sovereign state
This lead aesthetic dislike political dependency relation asymmetric dependence relation use program analysis
There lot minor variation dependence graph
The dependence dependence always depends dependence could depend
The graph might show addition data dependence case called almost certainly called
The dependence graph might might superimposed top
Whether something called graph graph pretty much also matter taste
I try avoid writing unless I specifically talking someone else research used term
In particular research

Graph theory generally thought originating Königsberg bridge problem asked whether walker could cross seven bridge Königsberg Prussia Kaliningrad Russia without crossing twice
This graphical depiction problem node represent land mass edge bridge
Image Wikimedia When people hear word graph image spring mind pair perpendicular line overlaid line curve bar different height
But computer scientist use term often something different mind
The familiar example graph sense may network diagram computer router depicted circle connection depicted line segment
But graph represent kind thing sequence decision relationship data database play crucial role huge number algorithm
Technically graph consists two fundamental element node vertex usually depicted circle edge usually depicted line connecting node
Often computer science edge weighted Associated edge number indicates ease difficulty traversing
The weight edge could instance represent bandwidth wired connection network could represent cost money computational resource something else moving one step next process
Mathematicians developed handful standard technique describing graph The weight edge instance depicted big table map every node every
In computer science challenge posed graph generally lie analysis representation
Sometimes analysis requires careful consideration data represented node
Other time point graphic analysis precisely abstract away data The useful information general property network whole
A glance recent MIT News article provides coin phrase graphic evidence importance graph
Last month MIT professor mathematics Peter Shor former student Ramis Movassagh colleague published paper demonstrating could make useful quantum computing
Their proof relied part graph whose node represented quantum state physical system edge connected state could reached change energy
There crucial revelation graph highly connected There bottleneck transition state traverse
An August paper Alvin Cheung graduate student Department Electrical Engineering Computer Science advisor professor computer science engineering Sam Madden colleague Cornell University describes algorithm us graph represent discrete instruction computer program
Like Shor Movassagh Cheung Madden looking edge node
But unlike Shor Movassagh using weighted graph edge depicted amount data new instruction inherited last
Cheung Madden algorithm run multiple server identifying edge low weight minimizes data pas server improving efficiency
Finally another paper appeared last month Daniela Rus professor computer science engineering director MIT Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Laboratory postdoc Dan Feldman Cynthia Sung graduate student group described algorithm us particular type graph called tree
There interest node edge
The familiar example tree may diagram single node top fan successive layer depth
In Rus group algorithm bottom layer tree represented raw GPS data node represented data contained node beneath
That recent example
Many algorithm model decision problem graph For instance might treat game chess tree node represents state board node beneath represent possible move
Others use weighted graph depict data point database
Some major advance computer science involve problem specified using graph first place heart huge range logistical analysis
And say nothing perhaps intuitive use graph

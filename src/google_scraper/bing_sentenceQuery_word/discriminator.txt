I needed add extra field Role identity table MVC
I use migration
I added extension role like My migration class I getting The question Discriminator column
I column model
Why migration tool add field aim
Well quick answer understand least make clear
As Jasen told read link
But tell truth easy understand first time
Here quick answer As see new record contains ApplicationRole Discrimination column
So say column contains name new class inherits IdentityRole
So probably class inheriting IdentityRole record Identity system store value using class record created
As shown ApplicationRole Discriminator appeared record created class called ApplicationRole inherits IdentityRole

A Generative Adversarial Network GAN consists two generator discriminator
What discriminator able
Or specifically able distinguish classify real object example vector generated one able distinguish set generated vector set real vector
I tend think second option correct
However case build neural network classifies set vector instead vector
The discriminator must classify individual element fake
created generator real
taken training dataset
The discriminator generates label element batch
The loss function computed based label
Elements fed discriminator batch type
element batch real element batch fake
This fake data batch directly generated generator part computational graph
output generator directly connected input discriminator
This able propagate gradient generator parameter discriminator

This specific generative adversarial network GAN proposed Makhzani et al
Adversarial Autoencoders
In traditional GAN discriminator trained distinguish real sample p x fake generated sample output generator
On hand variational autoencoder us discriminator latent code z instead original sample
What I understand discriminator able distinguish latent code prior distribution p z posterior distribution q z
What reasoning behind discriminator model attempting discriminate something sample x traditional GAN
And discriminator trained rest autoencoder
The purpose prior distribution p z generative adversarial network able smoothly match latent code z known distribution input x domain vice versa
The encoder simple autoencoder without additional measure typical pipeline x E z D x would require x approach x D E x purpose decoder may simply learn reconstruct x regardless distribution obtained E
This mean p z irregular making generation new sample le feasible
Even slight change bottleneck vector sure encoder would ever able produce code x
In adversarial autoencoder AAE however encoder job encodes input p x respective code q z The latter task effectively enforced discriminator receives Even discriminator might know anything two distribution beginning matter making enough iteration
The ideal encoder manage trick discriminator point approximately accuracy discrimination process
Also note p x may Gaussian uniform distribution sort noise
Quoting Goodfellow Deep Learning book When developing generative model often wish extend neural network implement stochastic transformation x
One straightforward way augment neural network extra input z sampled simple probability distribution uniform Gaussian distribution
The neural network continue perform deterministic computation internally function f x z appear stochastic observer access z
Although denoising autoencoders rely aspect learn model ignores noise sample paper AAEs section show combining noise encoded vector class used incorporate label information sample
This information provided discriminator still influence encoder produce q z

In typed tag field present type value definition determines union member selected current union instance
Unlike conventional programming language offering support union discriminator IDL identical selected field name
Here example IDL union type definition Effective value type may contain AX selected field discriminator value may either stored memory separately
Therefore IDL logically separate information currently selected field name union effective value information current discriminator value
In example discriminator value may anything following well character belonging IDL type since branch specified example type allows use remaining character well
The also support tagged union allowing choose discriminator via enclosing structure function

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

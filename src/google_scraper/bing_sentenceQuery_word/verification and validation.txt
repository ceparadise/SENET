Applying system thinking computing climate sustainability Sometime I drafted frequently asked question list
Here I wrote meaning term validation verification The term Verification Validation commonly used software engineering mean two different type analysis
The usual definition In word validation concerned checking system meet customer actual need verification concerned whether system
Verification help determine whether software high quality ensure system useful
The distinction two term largely role specification
Validation process checking whether specification capture customer need verification process checking software meet specification
Verification includes activity associated producing high quality software testing inspection design analysis specification analysis
It relatively objective process various product document expressed precisely enough subjective judgement needed order verify software
In contrast validation extremely subjective process
It involves making subjective assessment well proposed system address need
Validation includes activity requirement modelling prototyping user evaluation
In traditional phased software lifecycle verification often taken mean checking product phase satisfy requirement previous phase
Validation relegated begining ending project requirement analysis acceptance testing
This view common many software engineering textbook misguided
It assumes customer requirement captured completely start project requirement change software developed
In practice requirement change throughout project partly reaction project development new software make new thing possible
Therefore validation verification needed throughout lifecycle
Finally V V regarded coherent discipline Software V V system engineering discipline evaluates software system context relative system element hardware user software
Software Verification Validation Its Role Computer Assurance Its Relationship Software Project Management Standards Dolores Wallace Roger Fujii NIST Special Publication Having thus carefully distinguished two term advice V V practitioner forget distinction think instead V V toolbox provides wide range tool asking different kind question software
And master use tool figure use
Here one attempt visualize space tool toolbox A range V V technique
Note modeling model checking refer building analyzing abstracted model software behaviour different kind beast scientific model used computational science For climate model definition focus specification make much sense detailed specification climate model built iterative refinement like agile software development
But matter toolbox approach still work mean tool applied little differently
An appropriate toolbox climate modeling look little different picture tool appropriate control system application software etc missing picture particular simulation software
I draw better picture I finished analyzing data field study practice used climate lab
Many different V V tool climate modelling lab room adding tool toolbox sharpening existing tool subject current research
But question best must proceed detailed analysis current practice effective
There seem plenty wandering space claiming model insufficiently verified validated
And people like pontificate climate modeler ought differently
But anyone pontificate way unable give detailed account V V technique climate modeller currently use blowing smoke
If know toolbox already really make constructive comment missing
Pingback Pingback Great article
Thank
This useful description
The diagram especially useful analyzing verification v validation testing
thnx article

description diagram help cmplt assignment


nice really helpful give clear idea verification validation

Pingback useful article verification validation
thanks
tks interesting informative article Thanks article
This helpful final year project
useful article thanks need list reference final year project

independent procedure used together checking product service system meet fulfills intended purpose
These critical component
The word verification validation sometimes preceded independent indicating verification validation performed disinterested third party
Independent verification validation abbreviated
In practice usage term varies
Sometimes even used interchangeably
standard adopted defines follows edition Verification intended check product service system portion thereof set thereof meet set design specification
In development phase verification procedure involve performing special test model simulate portion entirety product service system performing review analysis modeling result
In phase verification procedure involve regularly repeating test devised specifically ensure product service system continues meet initial design requirement specification regulation time progress
It process used evaluate whether product service system complies regulation condition imposed start development phase
Verification development production
This often internal process
Validation intended ensure product service system portion thereof set thereof result product service system portion thereof set thereof meet operational need user
For new development flow verification flow validation procedure may involve modeling either flow using simulation predict fault gap might lead invalid incomplete verification development product service system portion thereof set thereof
A set validation requirement defined user specification regulation may used basis qualifying development flow verification flow product service system portion thereof set thereof
Additional validation procedure also include designed specifically ensure modification made existing qualified development flow verification flow effect producing product service system portion thereof set thereof meet initial design requirement specification regulation validation help keep flow qualified
It process establishing evidence provides high degree assurance product service system accomplishes intended requirement
This often involves acceptance fitness purpose end user product stakeholder
This often external process
It sometimes said validation expressed query Are building right thing
verification Are building right
Building right thing refers back user need building right check specification correctly implemented system
In context required written requirement well formal procedure protocol determining compliance
It entirely possible product pass verified fails validated
This happen say product built per specification specification fail address user need
Verification machinery equipment usually consists design qualification DQ installation qualification IQ operational qualification OQ performance qualification PQ
DQ may performed vendor user confirming review testing equipment meet written acquisition specification
If relevant document manual provided vendor later need thoroughly performed user work industrial regulatory environment
Otherwise process IQ OQ PQ task validation
The typical example case could loss absence vendor documentation legacy equipment DIY assembly car computer etc
therefore user endeavour acquire DQ document beforehand
Each template DQ IQ OQ PQ usually found internet respectively whereas DIY qualification assisted either vendor training course material tutorial published guidance book series acquisition bundled site qualification service
This kind DIY approach also applicable qualification software computer operating system manufacturing process
The important critical task last step activity generating archiving qualification report auditing purpose regulatory compliance mandatory
Qualification venue dependent particular item shock sensitive require balancing need conducted object relocated
The full scale equipment qualification even time dependent consumables used
filter spring requiring hence necessary specified due time lapse
also conducted replacement part coupling another device installing new restructuring computer affect especially shared library necessary
In situation specification restructuring proposal appended qualification document whether genuine
Torres Hyman discussed suitability part clinical use provided guideline equipment user select appropriate substitute capable avoid adverse effect
In case genuine demanded regulatory requirement need conducted assembly
Instead asset recycled purpose
When qualification conducted standard endorsed third party standard accredited company particular division process called certification
Currently coverage certification accredited organization limited scheme requires fair amount effort get popularized
Validation work generally categorized following function The tested attribute validation task may include limited These term generally apply broadly across industry institution
In addition may specific meaning requirement specific product regulation industry

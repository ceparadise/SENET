often called technology consisting component used retain digital
It core function fundamental component computer
The CPU computer manipulates data performing computation
In practice almost computer use put fast expensive small storage option close CPU slower larger cheaper option farther away
Generally fast volatile technology lose data power referred memory slower persistent technology referred storage
In CPU consists two main part The ALU
The former control flow data CPU memory latter performs arithmetic data
Without significant amount memory computer would merely able perform fixed operation immediately output result
It would reconfigured change behavior
This acceptable device desk specialized device
machine differ memory store operating data
Such computer versatile need hardware reconfigured new program simply new instruction also tend simpler design relatively simple processor may keep successive computation build complex procedural result
Most modern computer von Neumann machine
A modern represents using
Text number picture audio nearly form information converted string binary digit value
The common unit storage equal bit
A piece information handled computer device whose storage space large enough accommodate simply
For example page print stored five million bit one byte per character
Data assigning bit pattern object
Many standard exist encoding like image encoding like video encoding like
By adding bit encoded unit redundancy allows computer detect error coded data correct based mathematical algorithm
Errors generally occur low probability due bit value flipping physical bit fatigue loss physical bit storage ability maintain distinguishable value due error inter communication
A random due random typically corrected upon detection
A bit group malfunctioning physical bit always specific defective bit known group definition depends specific storage device typically automatically taken use device replaced another functioning equivalent group device corrected bit value restored possible
The CRC method typically used communication storage
A detected error retried
method allow many case database represent string bit shorter bit string compress reconstruct original string decompress needed
This utilizes substantially le storage ten percent many type data cost computation compress decompress needed
Analysis storage cost saving cost related computation possible delay data availability done deciding whether keep certain data compressed
For certain type data information may kept storage prevent possibility unauthorized information reconstruction chunk storage snapshot
Generally lower storage hierarchy lesser greater access CPU
This traditional division storage primary secondary tertiary storage also guided cost per bit
In contemporary usage memory usually storage typically dynamic RAM form fast temporary storage
Storage consists storage device medium directly accessible typically drive device slower RAM retaining content powered
Historically called
Meanwhile storage device referred
also known often referred simply one directly accessible CPU
The CPU continuously read instruction stored executes required
Any data actively operated also stored uniform manner
Historically used rotating primary storage
By unreliable method mostly replaced
Core memory remained dominant advance technology allowed become economically competitive
This led modern RAM
It light quite expensive time
The particular type RAM used primary storage also
lose information powered
As shown diagram traditionally two primary storage besides main RAM Main memory directly indirectly connected central processing unit via
It actually two bus diagram
The CPU firstly sends number address bus number called indicates desired location data
Then read writes data using data bus
Additionally MMU small device CPU RAM recalculating actual memory address example provide abstraction task
As RAM type used primary storage volatile uninitialized start computer containing storage would source read instruction order start computer
Hence containing small startup program used computer read larger program storage RAM start execute
A technology used purpose called ROM terminology may somewhat confusing ROM type also capable
Many type ROM literally update possible however slow memory must erased large portion
Some run program directly ROM similar program rarely changed
Standard computer store program ROM rather use large capacity secondary storage well costly
Recently us refer historically called respectively
also known differs primary storage directly accessible CPU
The computer usually us channel access secondary storage transfer desired data using primary storage
Secondary storage lose data device powered
Per unit typically also two order magnitude le expensive primary storage
Modern computer system typically two order magnitude secondary storage primary storage data kept longer time
In modern computer usually used secondary storage
The time taken access given byte information stored hard disk typically thousandth second millisecond
By contrast time taken access given byte information stored memory measured billionth second nanosecond
This illustrates significant difference distinguishes memory rotating magnetic storage device hard disk typically million time slower memory
Rotating device drive even longer access time
With disk drive disk head reach proper placement data interest rotates subsequent data track fast access
To reduce seek time rotational latency data transferred disk large contiguous block
When data reside disk accessing large block hide latency offer opportunity design efficient
Sequential block access disk order magnitude faster random access many sophisticated paradigm developed design efficient algorithm based upon sequential block access
Another way reduce bottleneck use multiple disk parallel order increase bandwidth primary secondary memory
Some example secondary storage technology
key standalone
The secondary storage often formatted according format provides abstraction necessary organize data providing also additional information called describing owner certain file access time access permission information
Most computer use concept allowing utilization primary storage capacity physically available system
As primary memory fill system move chunk secondary storage device retrieving later needed
As retrieval slower secondary storage necessary overall system performance degraded
provides third level storage
Typically involves robotic mechanism insert removable mass storage medium storage device according system demand data often copied secondary storage use
It primarily used archiving rarely accessed information since much slower secondary storage
second millisecond
This primarily useful extraordinarily large data store accessed without human operator
Typical example include
When computer need read information tertiary storage first consult catalog determine tape disc contains information
Next computer instruct fetch medium place drive
When computer finished reading information robotic arm return medium place library
Tertiary storage also known near online
The formal distinction online nearline offline storage For example spinning hard disk drive online storage spinning drive spin automatically massive array idle disk nearline storage
Removable medium tape cartridge automatically loaded nearline storage tape cartridge must manually loaded offline storage
computer data storage medium device control
The medium recorded usually secondary tertiary storage device physically removed disconnected
It must inserted connected human operator computer access
Unlike tertiary storage accessed without human interaction
storage used since detached medium easily physically transported
Additionally case disaster example fire destroys original data medium remote location probably unaffected enabling
storage increase general since physically inaccessible computer data confidentiality integrity affected attack technique
Also information stored archival purpose rarely accessed storage le expensive tertiary storage
In modern personal computer secondary tertiary storage medium also used storage
Optical disc flash memory device popular much lesser extent removable hard disk drive
In enterprise us magnetic tape predominant
Older example floppy disk Zip disk punched card
Storage technology level storage hierarchy differentiated evaluating certain core characteristic well measuring characteristic specific particular implementation
These core characteristic volatility mutability accessibility addressability
For particular implementation storage technology characteristic worth measuring capacity performance
retains stored information even constantly supplied electric power
It suitable storage information
requires constant power maintain stored information
The fastest memory technology volatile one although universal rule
Since primary storage required fast predominantly us volatile memory
form volatile memory also requires stored information periodically reread rewritten otherwise would vanish
form volatile memory similar DRAM exception never need refreshed long power applied loses content power supply lost
An UPS used give computer brief window time move information primary volatile storage storage battery exhausted
Some system example integrated battery maintain volatile storage several minute
As commonly used data storage medium semiconductor magnetic optical paper still see limited usage
Some fundamental storage technology used past proposed development
us store information
A semiconductor memory chip may contain million tiny
Both form semiconductor memory exist
In modern computer primary storage almost exclusively consists dynamic volatile semiconductor memory
Since turn century type semiconductor memory known steadily gained share storage home computer
semiconductor memory also used secondary storage various advanced electronic device specialized computer designed
As early manufacturer started using SSDs default configuration option secondary storage either addition instead traditional HDD
us different pattern coated surface store information
Magnetic storage
The information accessed using one head may contain one recording transducer
A head cover part surface head medium must moved relative another order access data
In modern computer magnetic storage take form In early computer magnetic storage also used typical store information deformity surface circular disc read information illuminating surface observing reflection
Optical disc storage
The deformity may permanent read medium formed write medium reversible recordable medium
The following form currently common use optical disc storage magnetic state surface store information
The information read optically written combining magnetic optical method
disc storage slow write fast read storage used tertiary storage
also proposed
Light induced magnetization melting magnetic photoconductors also proposed consumption storage
typically form long used store information automatic processing particularly computer existed
Information recorded punching hole paper cardboard medium read mechanically later optically determine whether particular location medium solid contained hole
A technology allow people make mark paper easily read widely used tabulating vote grading standardized test
made possible object sold transported computer readable information securely attached
While group bit malfunction may resolved error detection correction mechanism see storage device malfunction requires different solution
The following solution commonly used valid storage device Device mirroring typical RAID designed handle single device failure RAID group device
However second failure occurs RAID group completely repaired first failure data lost
The probability single failure typically small
Thus probability two failure RAID group time proximity much smaller approximately probability squared multiplied
If database tolerate even smaller probability data loss RAID group replicated mirrored
In many case mirroring done geographically remotely different storage array handle also recovery disaster see disaster recovery
A secondary tertiary storage may connect computer utilizing
This concept pertain primary storage shared multiple processor lesser degree
Large quantity individual magnetic tape optical disc may stored robotic tertiary storage device
In tape storage field known optical storage field optical disk library per analogy

memory like elephant like sieve
You often hear people comparing one thing almost never hear someone say memory like
partly human brain different purpose operate
But also reflects fact human often struggle remember name face even day week computer memory closest thing memory perfection
How exactly remarkable rememberers actually work
Let take closer look
The basic purpose keep record information period time
One really noticeable thing human memory extremely good
That sound like major defect consider pay attention many thing
In word forgetting likely clever tactic human evolved help u focus thing immediately relevant important endless clutter everyday way concentrating really matter
Forgetting like turning old junk closet make room new stuff
Computers remember forget thing way human brain
Computers work explained fully box either know something learned barring sort catastrophic failure generally forget
Humans different
We thing I seen face somewhere feel certain know something I remember learning German word cherry I school without necessarily able recollect
Unlike computer human forget remember forget remember making memory seem like art magic science technology
When clever people master trick allow memorize thousand piece information celebrated like great though achieved far le impressive anything USB flash memory stick could
One thing human brain computer common different type memory
Human memory actually split working memory thing recently seen heard processed brain memory fact learned event experienced thing know generally need remember much longer
A typical computer two different kind memory well
There sometimes called internal memory made silicon chip
It store retrieve computerized information quickly used help computer process whatever currently working
Generally internal memory mean forgets content soon power switched
That computer also called storage well remembers thing even power disconnected
In typical PC laptop auxiliary memory generally provided
Auxiliary memory also called older larger computer typically housed completely separate machine connected main computer box cable
In similar way modern PCs often auxiliary storage form USB flash memory stick SD memory card plug thing like plug rewriter
In practice distinction main memory auxiliary memory get little blurred
Computers limited amount main memory typically somewhere modern computer
The quickly process information faster get thing done
If computer need store space main memory room temporarily move le important thing main memory onto hard drive called free space
When happens hear hard drive clicking away high speed computer read writes data back forth virtual memory real main memory
Because hard drive take time access memory chip using virtual memory much slower process using main really slows computer
That essentially computer memory work faster
The chip make computer internal memory come two broad flavor known
RAM chip remember thing computer powered used storing whatever computer working short term
ROM chip hand remember thing whether power
preprogrammed information factory used store thing like computer BIOS basic system operates fundamental thing like computer screen
RAM ROM helpful name world shortly find worry sound baffling
Just remember key point main memory inside computer based two kind chip temporary volatile kind remembers power RAM permanent nonvolatile kind remembers whether power ROM
Today machine vastly RAM early home computer
This table show typical amount RAM Apple computer original Apple I released iPhone smartphone released four decade later almost time RAM onboard
Here prefix K byte byte
This thing get slightly confusing
RAM name theory quick computer read write information one part RAM memory chip
Incidentally applies much ROM chip could say example nonvolatile RAM chip
Hard drive also broadly speaking device take roughly time read information point drive
Not kind computer memory random access however
It used common computer store information separate machine known tape drive using long spool magnetic tape like version music cassette Sony Walkman cassette player
If computer wanted access information spool backward forward tape reached exactly point like wind back forth tape age find track wanted play
If tape right beginning information computer wanted end quite delay waiting tape spool forward right point
If tape happened right place computer could access information wanted pretty much instantly
Tapes example information stored sequence long take read write piece information depends tape happens relation head read writes information tape given moment
RAM come two main variety called
DRAM le expensive two higher density pack data smaller space SRAM used internal memory find PCs game console
SRAM faster us le power DRAM given greater cost lower density likely used smaller temporary working memory cache form part computer internal external memory
It also widely used portable gadget minimizing power consumption maximizing life extremely important
The difference DRAM SRAM arise way built basic
Both type RAM volatile DRAM also need power zapped occasionally keep memory fresh SRAM need refreshing way
DRAM dense store information le space us one one store bit binary digit information SRAM need several transistor bit
Like RAM ROM also come different confuse matter strictly readonly
The find USB memory stick digital camera memory card actually kind ROM retains information almost indefinitely even power much like conventional ROM still reprogrammed relatively easily whenever necessary like conventional RAM
Technically speaking flash memory type electrically erasable programmable ROM mean information stored wiped relatively easily passing memory
Hmmm might thinking memory work way passing electricity
Yes
But name really historic reference fact erasable reprogrammable ROM used work different way
Back common form erasable rewritable ROM erasable programmable ROM
EPROM chip erased relatively laborious inconvenient method first removing circuit blasting powerful
Imagine go longwinded process every time wanted store new set photo digital camera memory card
Gadgets cellphone often store software ROM might expect flash memory
That mean easily update new relatively permanent software stored ROM whenever upgrade come along process called flashing
As may noticed ever copied large amount information flash memory upgraded router firmware flash memory reprogrammable ROM work slowly conventional RAM memory take longer write read
The popular kind auxiliary memory used modern PCs
But long fascinating people used kind memory device stored information magnetizing thing
popular stored information floppy disk
These small thin circle plastic coated magnetic material spinning inside durable case gradually reduced size inch inch final popular size inch
similar stored much information highly compressed form inside chunky cartridge
In microcomputer forerunner today PCs often stored information using exactly like one people used back playing music
You might surprised hear big computer department still widely use tape backing data today largely method simple inexpensive
It matter tape work slowly sequentially using backup generally want copy restore data systematic time necessarily critical
Going back even time computer recorded information small ring made material even earlier machine stored information using switch like used circuit vacuum tube bit like miniature version tube used
Photos video text file sound computer store process kind information form number digit
That sometimes called computer
Humans like work number decimal base system ten different digit ranging
Computers hand work using entirely different number system called based two number zero one
In decimal system column number correspond one ten hundred thousand step binary column represent power two two four eight sixteen thirty two sixty four
So decimal number becomes binary
You need lot inary dig also called store number
With eight bit also called store decimal number binary
One reason people like decimal number finger
Computers finger
What instead thousand million even billion electronic switch called
Transistors store binary number electric current passing switch
Switching transistor store one switching store zero
A computer store decimal number memory switching whole series transistor binary pattern rather like someone holding series flag
The number like holding five flag keeping one pattern So storing number easy
But add subtract multiply divide using nothing electric current
You use clever circuit called logic gate read article

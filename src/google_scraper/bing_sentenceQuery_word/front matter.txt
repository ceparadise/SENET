The number college student pursuing computer science degree university rose first time six year according released study
Academia policymakers hailing news question facing CIOs others charge IT hiring How much Do company need employee deep technical skill developed computer science software engineering degree better business major
Not surprisingly computer science educator software company hardware manufacturer adamant need computer science major drive innovation tech company
The dearth computer science graduate forcing company look offshore qualified people argue
Not enough computer science major serious repercussion competitiveness say Professor Cary Laxer head computer science software engineering Institute Technology
There large number Chinese student Indian student interested work
We going lose competitive edge country turn software engineer
But CIOs IT staffing firm say need collaboration problem solving communication developed motivated college student
After today Millennials wireless social medium technology integrated lifestyle grasp exploit far better boss
Computer science degree mattered lot year ago IT cost center
But job IT The huge IT budget even CIOs line business say David Foote CEO Foote Partners conduct quarterly survey IT skill pay
This brought whole new group IT skill come mathematics economics business marketing
On March The Computing Research Association issued annual report number college student pursuing computer science bachelor degree university
The number shown sharp decline throughout decade
In fall around newly declared computer science major
That figure dropped half bust bottoming last two year
But increase
See
Having enough computer science software engineering major critical tech company say need hire undergraduate deep technical skill practical programming experience
For software engineering role tend look people strong computer science background experience programming say Yvonne Agyei director Talent Outreach Programs Google People Operations Department
We need core programming skill algorithm skill quantitative analysis
We looking people majored computer science engineering sometimes math physic
Agyei say hire computer savvy business major department software engineering
In addition software engineering role role within business within legal within finance facility technology passion technology important Agyei say
It help familiarity product
Having knowledge really important regardless aspect business go
Even year rise computer science major tech company say still enough computer scientist engineer fill open job
That tech company CIOs often hire instead
In responded drop computer science degree creating provides free software training tool college professor across discipline rather computer science department
IBM working college faculty worldwide around student
As company greater greater need computer communication software decline student going consequence supply demand balance say Kevin Faughnan director IBM Academic Initiative
IBM goal Academic Initiative encourage college student become familiar IT apply across industry
With initiative IBM focusing strengthening technical underpinning business major rather encouraging computer science major
The business student computer science skill intro data management Web part major Faughnan say
We try encourage faculty interdisciplinary
As part initiative IBM provided university simulation game teach business process modeling It incumbent business school integrate technology curriculum Faughnan say
I think technology much computer science major horizontal skill applied across discipline
For example ca marketing day without data mining
CIOs say hiring business major IT experience computer science major
Henry Eckstein senior vice president strategy technology York Insurance Services Group say member IT shop computer science software engineering degree
Most employee Russia
Eckstein say making hiring decision weighs experience first IT certification second college degree third
If I look candidate I see computer science major going influence decision I looking newer least I know good training discipline Eckstein say
But going someone computer science degree
Particularly I looking developer I looking skill set many year experience knowledge subject matter
When CIOs surveyed top skill looking employee cite technical skill
Instead top concern ethic critical thinking collaboration communication skill according CIO survey compiled
The technical skill demand programming database system analysis ranked lower CIOs priority list
You computer science degree get entry level job IT say Professor Jerry Luftman executive director School Technology Management Stevens Institute Technology
Luftman compiles SIM annual CIO survey
When CIOs asked skill looking people clear skill critical
Luftman say computer science major engineer make good IT professional critical thinking skill logical analysis
But say business information system major valuable employee balance technical skill business collaboration communication skill
During downturn IT asked work business partner identify opportunity leverage IT improve process improve productivity Luftman say
My advice Generation X Generation make sure good balance technical business skill
Stephen Pickett past president SIM auto industry CIO say lack computer science major problem CIOs
That SIM local chapter working business school improve technical offering computer science school improve business course
We necessarily need computer science graduate
A business graduate strong computer science curriculum work lot case Pickett say
In computer science school try add business curriculum get student coming
Pickett say MIS degree good match IT business skill
It enough add computer hobbyist
The thing need project management experience business process evaluation
You get knowing application desktop Pickett add
College grad look business process find improve people going popular
Striking right balance technical skill business knowledge critical given global economic meltdown Pickett say
In downturn even important get people solve business problem business problem much difficult solve Pickett say
You solve problem without significant business resource
You technical knowledge business knowledge lot imagination
Foote say counsel high school student think carefully business like work
The question Do want techie guy work bowel organization work infrastructure job want front working application
Foote say
If want front might want work HR finance whatever area business interest
You also want look industry casino insurance whatever figure product service interested
Foote recommends student majoring math business pursue minor computer science
That give much view IT give option say
Computer science educator claim image old fashioned way viewing program
There perception propagated medium computer science major mean work bowel organization coding front terminal eating potato chip drinking Mountain Dew say Professor Lenny Pitt Director Undergraduate Programs Department Computer Science University Illinois
This far truth
Our graduate working bridge management technical people
They technical writing software testing usability
In light declining enrollment decade top computer science school like University Illinois retooled curriculum embrace soft skill collaboration communication
These department focused graduating student explain complex technical issue layman term
The decline enrollment last six year forced professor think teaching computer science student make sure giving skill need successful like collaborative learning working part team say Peter Harsha director government affair CRA
Carnegie Mellon University emphasizes teamwork collaboration computer science program requires technical communication course
Students also required take course humanity pursue minor field foreign language
Twenty year ago kid would get program would nerdy added requirement program force broader say Professor Peter Lee head Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University
Today opposite problem people tendency dabbler
We want deep broad
Carnegie Mellon strategy seems working
Last year Carnegie Mellon computer science graduate went work industry including IT vendor Microsoft Google IT user Bloomberg Goldman Sachs
The went graduate school
Where see demand high salary people deep technical software skill Lee say
These student computer savvy able manage IT operation
They actually understand software issue engineer software
Those people recruiter want
Lee predicts computer science major remain demand industry becoming dependent computing data mining

Freelance Writer Think thing every day posting status update downloading song checking class schedule online Do think would cool design technology make device work better
To invent new one
To help make people life job easier
Then maybe right path
But first let set thing straight
Computer scientist people call printer stop working
And sit dark cubicle day without talking anyone
Whatever think computer science wrong say Dianna Xu Chair Computer Science Department Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania
So
Computer scientist use technology solve problem
They write software make computer new thing accomplish task efficiently
They create application mobile device develop website program software
And find everywhere big tech firm government agency startup nonprofit
It everyday computing say Liz Burd Chancellor Learning Teaching University Newcastle Australia
It building tool enable everyday One biggest thing computer science major learn logically think problem find way solve
Chris Stephenson Executive Director Computer Science Teachers Association add good computer scientist also understand teamwork good communicator
They work people time say including come CS background
No matter brilliant point explain someone product work code Stephenson say
Bobby Schnabel Dean School Informatics Computing chair Association Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee say student go computer science like working computer
Others want solve problem technology
Whatever passion CS degree great foundation kind job
Anokwa nine year old first programmed computer
It father used teaching journalism Indianapolis Anokwa allowed touch anyway entering online competition win faster modem
In high school started business repairing computer classmate parent
In college earned two degree one computer science Butler one electrical engineering
There Anokwa began think people could use computing change world better
After computer everywhere desk pocket inside device use every day
Software powerful say
During graduate school Anokwa spent six month volunteering public health organization Rwanda helped introduce electronic medical record system used nationwide
That experience inspired Anokwa develop Open Data Kit platform replaces paper form smart phone tablet computer
Its tool used world
Election observer use monitor poll Egypt health worker Kenya use track effort combat HIV Brazilians use measure illegal logging rainforest
Anokwa partner eventually started company called Nafundi consults client using tool like Open Data Kit
These day I lot programming Anokwa say
Those skill head
All skill I need I learned first couple year Brown meant study philosophy enrolled Lexington Virginia
But also liked tinkering computer
He took class logic class computer programming
It might seem like two subject anything common Brown liked relied logical thinking
It seems like straightforward correlation say
The summer graduating computer science degree went back hometown Memphis Tennessee got job lifeguarding country club
Through someone met found next job helped company find new employee department
Outside work joined informal group programmer
That met founder website called MyRepresentatives
The site make easy people live Memphis area find represents local state federal government
Brown started working site lead developer
It unpaid valuable position
He working MyRepresentatives month landed paid job Lindsey Software company design program public housing agency work today
The computer programming class Lynch took high school one favorite
I liked knowing logic understanding thing work say
How work solve problem She majored computer science Colchester Vermont learned little bit everything computing programming language mathematical principle behind technology managing website attack problem system
The biggest thing degree gave perfect foundation build career Lynch say
In experience general degree
A technical degree general Now technical analyst Esri software company us sophisticated mapping technology called geographic information system GIS
Lynch even know GIS joined Esri imagine working industry
Among thing company software used map damage Hurricane Sandy left East Coast illustrate federal government sent money different project
Lynch design application company use Esri software
In job help customer work colleague develop test application
She like different thing every day
Every month something change I get cutting edge happening field say
Umali might playing day since company Turbine develops world popular online game sometimes need play make sure everything work correctly
Turbine make game like Dungeons Dragons The Lord Rings
Umali work behind scene keep game running smoothly making sure user sign want play list top player date
It energetic dynamic environment say
Umali graduated computer science degree Troy New York
Since several job software industry managing data people access need
Technology changed lot since college Umali say computer science major taught timeless skill like examine process information
They taught u principle break problem manageable piece say
Then prepared learn innovation field like new programming language

She year experience staffing industry writing blog post sample resume providing sage career advice IT professional Dice Community since
Leslie bachelor degree English Journalism University Southern California
Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo

LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee

FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont

said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said

Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job

Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job

CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus

Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers

recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year

Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get
Any advice appreciated thank much

It follows neatly discrete mathematics infinite sum difference equation differential equation calculus necessary statistic lot CS work modeling natural science basic understanding calculus helpful
That also application I far calculus work
Discrete mathematics somewhat useful generally least university emphasis
We one semester pure calculus one pure discrete mathematics requirement mad people take additional course semester solid understanding discrete math assumed various course learning security signalling calculus also come think algorithm crypto practice expanded upon
Signal processing end pulling quite bit calculus transforming
I remember studying I took concurrently Cal I Cal II requirement
The modeling physical phenomenon commonly involve equation solvable numerically many differential integral equation
This fall purview Computer Science way approach without calculus
Computer science math computer
The area probably use calculus run time analysis however barely scratching surface
Well time rethink major path
I hardly get college algebra
Its different kind math
And school math I Calc prerequisite probability stuff
No calc actually used CS class
Maybe one time
If enjoy programming let math discourage bad think Yeah
Most math enhances understanding programming concept thought process
Things like discrete math set theory really help look problem different way
I loved discrete Discrete really point I understood math useful
It point I wished I could go back get earlier math course
I agree
I surprised discrete math taught high school level
Or mix discrete intro CS instead pure CS course
It would helped immensely choosing path college
Linear bad yet
thing love Linear big matrix matrix chance screw problem know
Most teacher lenient messing one calculation complicated matrix computation
Any linear algebra teacher count problem completely mostly wrong messing way missing point
Even annoyed easy make mistake completely invalidate result invented new le prone miscaclulations
He recommended method doctorand letter Das indirecte Verfahren lässt sich halb im Schlafe ausführen oder man kann während desselben andere Dinge denken
Which mean something like You actually think thing calculation
In also known used solve
It named similar
Though applied matrix element diagonal convergence guaranteed matrix either
It mentioned private letter Gauss student
A publication delivered Seidel
Had exact thing happen I took Linear Algabra test
The problem use LA solve chemical reaction easy dropped negative sign setting equation
Took forever find problem
Do linear optimization problem linear programming offered That awesome learning powerful application matrix involve computer graphic
We probably room degree plan unless I want take second victory lap
Too bad really cool class people liked linear algebra
Linear discrete math
That jam yo
Math related lot build calculus
For example probability course CS use calculus define certain thing
Compare major memorize simple equation told scenario used
Are saying algorithm analysis
Complexity analysis would difficult without limit rule
The concept limit important Hardly used directly
I never touched Calc I
In algorithm course would ask complexity analysis given algorithm one written would answer big O notation kinda looking
I could tell damned thing mathematically analyzing algorithm
Placing algorithm complexity class typically counting argument many I performed
Showing two complexity class distinct however requires help calculus
requires help calculus
This help absolutely minimal In trivial case yeah get hairy fast check Flajolet Sedgewick Analytic Combinatorics example complete book discrete math combinatorics like Knuth Concrete Mathematics
I remember serious calculus Knuth book
Granted calculus real analysis play significant role theory area computer science
However symbolic logic play far greater role CS whole yet studied much rigor much zeal calculus
I speak proving complexity
Termination useful
I curious school year course
I year algorithm course professor love rigour
Boston University
It course
The professor kind eccentric
We focused algorithm worked proof correctness optimality
Obviously complexity also important viewed described many operation algorithm perform
I talked classmate took course another professor seemed lot math involved using complicated summation calc concept prove complexity
I lucky
But small part calculus There one class write program slicing stuff calc long form
Kinda using computer recursion manually calc limit
I felt pretty accomplished I got working
That definite integral Riemann Sums thinking
problem
I graduated highschool year ago went right college
Because math I finally got last year I wo graduate end next year
I kept failing math taking semester going back
Over time I learned programming found math taught along programming course would much easier
So learn side
But I never gave either He went concert deleted Weird Edinburgh Informatics CS
generally Norway
Information system though uh something else IT management shudder
And Computer Engineering class
There Computer Engineering major US
I exactly know I believe supposed mix CS EE
At Purdue went bit like Computer Science You know enough math prove theorem complexity computational geometry
Requires Calc
You know program embedded system supercomputer everything
You know distributed calculation get divvied right way
You formally instructed Java somehow learn Matlab Python leave
Computer Engineering Electrical engineering focus integrated circuit design digital system signal processing etc
You might able program well except VHDL design system program counter
Probably math intensive lot
Lots physic heart ache
Computer Technology The applied lot
Setting network
Learning build website
Lots Java
Little theory
At tOSU like CSE Computer Science Engineering It degree College Engineering
I completed education yet go Calc III along set theory class another discrete mathematics class later
CIS Computer Information Science It degree College Arts Sciences
I CSE I entirely sure true difference major
CIS student take engineering course though course really helped problem solving thinking process
I believe need Calc II take discrete class
Sorry I terribly sure go
Just thought interesting split two different college
deleted UW Washington
Wisconsin
Something else
Hey u web developer write real code
Sorry I always understood web developer mean developer
I never really around designer call web developer
True CS algorithm analysis coding
If want developer need CS degree
As someone said earlier CS math actual computer
Well want job degree sure hurt
But necessarily need degree
Some college make clear separation CS Software Engineering major
I wish
I agreement
If want grunt work need CS degree
If want work really cool project CS degree invaluable
Can confirm I use CS solve problem every day coding way expressing solution
I love job
coding way expressing solution
Well yeah exactly
I would even go far say theoretical CS simply math
We use slightly different formal notation slightly different concept real mathematiciants
But overlap actually pretty huge since math department nowadays tend utilize computer labor intensive work anyways
deleted But I offload heavy web application calculation backend front end using javascript
Basically constraint satisfaction problem take invalid state fix making minimum possible change
Only catch
almost instant possible state
There work web development solid algorithm background got ta know look
deleted Hah yea trust I get time I tell people I work web development
Usually followed blowing mind see stack
Now I like blow mind
I found hate UI work anything especially Web
What stack working
He designer
That page TERRIBLE
Ugh
The vast majority CS graduate either
I generally mean development I say web development
Does web development mean stuff
deleted In experience folk advertising work ask developer
Has anyone else seen
meeeeeeh necessarily
basic algebra time mostly school I finally reason math
After climb algebra past calculus I think fine
I beg differ
The problem seems teaching thing promise useful later something else
The promise lot people got high school often failed materialize
It taught way around
Here problem X let analyze ah woha dude sick
But course never happen within current system
See Dewey Montesori last decade education research
You would first graduate computer science struggle math component
That might mean going grad school professional scientist question mean ca scrape algebra calculus go world useful work
Not every computer scientist actually need calculus
In real world field end specializing
University try give broad overview possible thing lot web developer game play programmer network administrator network programmer etc
never touch complex math
Graphics programmer data modeller people serious performance constraint might graphic programmer might touched socket programming since university
The professor make big difference worth asking around good instructor teaching course require
No time start learning math
Go office hour
Talk ta professor
Get tutor
Not one c class I ever taken used sort calculus even mentioned
What run time analysis would need calculus
To op ask around see actually use c class school
Ask c department head upperclassmen making mind switch
I hated calc work aerospace software industry never see
anaylsis randomized algorithm also approximation algorithm Amortized Online algorithm
Calculus used instance My algorithm class cover
Did learn particular c class
I would guess algorithm used developer career
These come statistical work machine learning context
Anything relies heavily probability liable rooted integral calculus
It pretty unlikely developer would actually math understanding arguably useful
Personally I think solid understanding probability theory invaluable applied AI work really clarifies motivation behind concept algorithm
If think computer science program computer probably chosen wrong major
If goal developer likely wo use advanced math job computer science programming thing
But make class graduate computer science degree much easier time getting developer job
It depends university
I sucked math
I know college mine computer science option light math came minor business admin
All I took remedial algebra algebra people suck algebra statistic class
That
Some school mathy others
Some vocational learn actually programming le calculus
I think underestimate
That said CS program better preparing student grad school industry
Industry need developer programmer
Just calculus isnt something enjoy doesnt mean cant highly successful developer industry
It depends industry
Go work project interest dont solely rely curriculum prepare job market
You still give calculus try difficult also whole lot interesting algebra make lot le tedious get
This somewhat upsetting news
I struggle basic algebra well
Always struggled immensely math
I always struggled math I sure I never enjoyed I never particularly tried hard school I several bad teacher
One earlier math teacher somehow got job despite lying CV guy qualified
Now I terrible math
I forgotten thing absolute basic
It annoying conflict interest I stalling going university I need essentially relearn math scratch
Ugh
I similar problem I could pas calc I needed pas calc
I thought switching IT I knew I would hate professor recommended Information Systems aka Management Information Systems
Its focused programming business setting need math class
A CS minor also helpful
Check maybe like
While true runtime analysis us calculus concept practice hard intuitively
Hey I got set run array three level
That probably going take long time LONGER time every time I add something array
Maybe I like pretty easy conclusion come
And advantageous skip right This going scale cubically blow hard get
Also calculus teach strategy HAVE iterate array like despite sucking
Only CS experience
Linear algebra regular algebra
Get tutor live hallway outside professor office
You may also want look Software Engineering instead
The thing computer science undergraduate course typically theoretical computer science also software engineering field
Strictly speaking would seldom use calculus theoretical computer science useful generally
Let give example variant behind many multimedia compression format like JPEG
Ultimately understand need good background
You use calculus solve problem outside theoretical computer science
I find topic closer theoretical CS pretty hard like say graph theory harder calculus
Which mean would enjoy working IT whatever want CS degree
Was hoping go application development
You may need math much opinion would close path early dismissing math hard
IMO studying much better widen opportunity instead focusing single goal
I mean programming barely need math people develop software solve problem math make possible solve large number problem
Most time using library framework code written others
Sometimes hard math already implemented library need know little math understand use otherwise might slip bug know going
Sometimes bit need hard math yet need
An example
It computer vision library enabling process image video extract feature perform computation example count much people image
It lot heavy math underneath generally simple use
It implement example face object detection
You use label face image like Facebook track face video
It feature large number free parameter adjust make detect face full body apple etc
using algorithm
OpenCV come common classifier good

If interest computer vision lot neat stuff webcam patience follow tutorial
Now suppose developing product us OpenCV
Here knowing math could definitively help
I remembered struggling horribly college algebra
This made think I could finish program
This caused bullshit feeling Math Anxiety

I learned algebra calculus
You fine Well CS
But bear mind undergraduate math class put lot focus tricky problem
It probably good learning math discouraging seem irrelevant
And entirely relevant
You wo much hand computation higher level math class certainly wo computer science
You work equation confidently time time need figure something code probably lot better looking answer specific mathematical question need
But practice get calculus class problem tested honestly getting feel math really useful
Granted algebra really useful
Like abstract algebra using algebra arithmetic
But enjoy programming theoretical computer science learn appreciate math time
In simple way Calculus used figure information directly front
It help understand calculus write algorithm get information data acquire data
Ex You work company make window pane order many different size quantity
You many packaging size ship window want waste space
You need figure best combination window packaging maximize output using least amount box ship
You would write computer program take order calculate window shipped order program would able take future order input determine best solution
Calculus would main factor example
Just note Software Development CS major probably wo learn math
In normal software development almost never use
While others saying computer science broadly true really depends school balance would
I look whether school elocution offer software engineering degree offer concentration
Also interested project work vastly improve comfort tackling math take whack raytracer
Depending much implement cover everything basic vector matrix math dealing geometry full numerical integration light bouncing global illumination
I recommend book like
What shame
This fault
Those subject badly taught usually
Start something like say search algorithm
And go researching need logarithm limit etc
It easier study something curious need driving effort
I used teach failing student almost every case problem education addressing student unique personality
OP give
I take remedial algebra trig algebra Calc discrete math linear algebra
I actually took linear algebra three time dropping twice
If put effort eventually make
As someone else mentioned Calculus different type math
I think I used twice going stuff
Discrete math linear algebra stats proof based skill definitely transferred well upper division CS class like theory computation AI compiler
With Calculus much math developing ability solve problem wiring connection brain
Edit Replied wrong parent
Actually ashamed admit I remember integrate anymore Calculus minimally required core computer science course
However stuff like machine learning AI numerical optimization etc etc require strong foundation math
Linear algebra stats
Calculus nearly useful linear algebra combinatorics
You need good understanding understand many related concept algebra combinatorics though
Computer science professor
Here thought issue
I sure mean emphasized
I would say generally emphasized much
But course relative
Certainly emphasize calculus lot would say art major
In program require student prepared take Calculus I order declare
major
Our requirement

include semester calculus discrete math statistic math elective
I favor Ours professional degree like

would
Our program lead Bachelor Science includes expectation somewhat broad understanding
Certainly expectation include understanding mathematics
We full stack program
We expect graduate knowledge everything electron transistor circuit computer architecture operating system way application programming
Calculus certainly required physic behind lower end stack
More generally going call fully literate technologist I say need understand calculus I agree fully literate
Making calculus give good evidence mathematician call mathematical maturity handle mathematical reasoning
In experience similar mental skill required
class
If student trouble getting prerequisite calculus reasonable say Maybe
field
I think point way
Calc interesting straight memorization basic algorithm
If commit time effort pas class flying color never learned thing calculus really
I absolutely agree point number
It actually used directly thing like notation
You understand basic idea without science going theoretical work say reducing complexity algorithm tiny fraction exponent going need calculus
But aside discrete math much important
But able program us I think lot skill able discrete able get calculus
If trouble understanding derivative going trouble understanding harder comp sci problem I think
I one mind
Took physic I much need calculus I feel like I much better understanding world I live
Science literacy kind important
going theoretical work say reducing complexity algorithm tiny fraction exponent Do people actually
Every time I needed optimize I used bench marking tool find slow spot go
analysis barely play role
Mostly understanding technology using knowing part slow
For example method called often slow always hit database
If cache value could speed significantly
People work
If asking whether I likely industry probably fraction exponent probably le important suggesting likely reducing constant factor
I mean dataset fixed value n O n algorithm going take long time j kn fact j k constant
I might reduce bit getting O n real world going lot faster reduce k factor depending n maybe focusing j instead anyway
I mean better O nlogn sorting algorithm least general case insertion sort O n small enough n insertion sort faster much algorithm better characteristic like quicksort merge sort might drop insertion sort innermost level recursion
So real world shaving fraction exponent something likely
The theoretician may come back u better algorithm eventually might large enough constant matter working data might complex enough algorithm anyway willing take time simpler algorithm sure right
But answering part quoted
To answer part Every time I needed optimize I used bench marking tool find slow spot go
analysis barely play role
There certain amount could head design phase
You hopefully form anyway designing data structure program example hopefully least choose list hash table hopefully almost never use linked list
This minute design might save later suddenly need refactor huge chunk design
But least I done I rarely actually proved property
I mainly working fact I already know standard library tool I going use since I unlikely ever write sorting algorithm I help
Thank reply
It informative
There certain amount could head design phase
When I say barely play role exactly I mean
When picking data structure useful day day work
But picking data structure notation
You also care memory efficient long take resize structure
Do quick write link list
They good structure like queue
When picking data structure useful day day work
But picking data structure notation
You also care memory efficient long take resize structure
though I suspect different letter used measure play role
Resizing structure would go analysis actually unless chosen reason structure must manually resized
So concern though usually still talk lazily mean case case care might occasionally take time resize still minimal overall
Like ArrayList Java vector care much logn resizes might happen appending still dominated O
So right kind complexity analysis thing mentioned ca going find even harder find
Do quick write link list
They good structure like queue
I actually somewhat surprised find almost faster even queue structure like resizable make much efficient linked list queue operation
Linked list supposedly upper limit constant time resize practice true even use raw malloc often similar performance characteristic garbage collection anyway usually fast sometimes OS walk free list housekeeping give memory
And course Java even worse allocation range basically free GC maybe malloc
At point real advantage I think linked list might require le synchronization overhead least le contention queue used multiple thread
Even I bet still lose structure like problem made fit
That say I never use linked list
They simple enough write data structure C allowed use library like school assignment I see much use real world outside special case like free list garbage collector
Admit
You taking data structure course right
This sound like stuff I knew I school
Now important
It like I code monkey
I work R D large tech company
You use software I wrote everyday
Sorry I looked comment history
A lot time critical
If used resizable queue might miss window
Admit
You taking data structure course right
Actually couple year ago factor heavily hardest interview I ever lead offer I must something right
I matter month degree yeah data structure back
I also took break school ended working industry awhile though admittedly never anything suggesting
A lot time critical
If used resizable queue might miss window
Then I wonder deal issue I mentioned allocating new object GC language like Java avoid Java garbage collector making miss window
If calling malloc directly new deal fairly variable amount time take
If preallocate chunk memory allocate sound like much fundamentally different allocating large enough ring buffer begin
I also wonder much cache miss cost given linked list
I sure know situation I case linked list win maybe found one
But seem like entirely many people skip idea entirely go straight resizable array linked list
Generally language like Java wo work since hard predict GC kick
Resizing vector issue get large
I never worked project call malloc cause time window miss exist
Think LTE something tiny time window
They everything
For worth std implemented using linked list
Sanity already said yes people
However use theoretical research
The problem solved extremely general absolutely physical computer attached
The algorithm optimized use tool mentioned
They use tool mathematics
These proof reduction application usually
They solving open question
The whole concept P v NP example solved theory
Not application
That bound reduction come
Even formally break still important keep asymptotic complexity mind
After reading story I know person thinking
reducing complexity algorithm tiny fraction exponent going need calculus Really
In way would require usage calculus
At point prove done
By complexity I mean sort thing measured
And Calculus value But limit specific part calculus
Limits also crucial concept topology people say topology required understanding complexity analysis
Ah fair enough
I suppose key bit Calculus would Math class typically take learn limit
Also rule incredibly useful us derivative I recall
rule To honest I used statistic outside calculus class
But still probably learn go Depending level determination learn nearly anything go
But going apply directly opposed letting Wolfram Alpha work need least understand derivative
Which fair easiest part Calculus still
The main reason historical
Most CS program grew Math department
A good deal development work requires calculus analysis I get use basic calculus analyze sensor performance
Honestly I think program place emphasis calculus discrete mathematics
Instead taking Calc I Calc II compress one class require Discrete I Discrete II
Why compress calculus
Because underlying concept derivation integration may crucial field computer science student mastery trigonometric substitution
Focus differentiation integration give tool dig deeper need future
Instead teaching solve calculus problem teach
On hand discrete mathematics much core computer science many important topic master
Just Of course many point extremely broad yet essential mastery many higher level computer science class
Courses poor discrete background would handicap If I come across problem I solve calculus I may remember integrate part application like Mathematica
I understand significance resulting integral I I utterly lost
I absolutely love beauty calculus sometimes get bogged minutia technique lose sight big picture
Often computer science
Calc important class I took CS
It developed problem solving skill much else
The reason math taught school people ever actually need hone problem solving skill well
My Calc teacher told u You study algebra learn arithmetic study calculus learn algebra study differential equation learn calculus
get good course
I see
I really get calc Complex Analysis
Proving calculus also definable complex number made everything click oh yeah I actually understand whole calculus thing
PDEs constraint boundary condition help calc much I used occasional calc knowledge
Clearly talking abstract algebra Calculus class whipped algebra skill shape
Every great calculus teacher I constantly brought failing algebra common way fail calculus
This actual reason calculus required CS major
Thanks
No I say honestly real reason required university system designed make college professor
Calculus foundation much higher mathematics education would severely incomplete trying get PhD CS foundation
I know math school seems consist mostly Here rule learn heart Here problem
Apply rule learned rather coming solution
Though changed university
Right
calculus class often teach right way though
Anyone thread say need calc categorically understand computer science
Computer science time pure math computer
Programming Computer Science two different area confuse thing
CS degree used lot math almost calculus
Calculus show fair bit Machine Learning though much linear algebra
This true people Machine Learning
It also show graphic computer vision robotics And signal processing
And proof even equation lead new innovation
And calculus linear algebra real fun start
Please confused calculus pure math
Sure mathematician work area analysis calculus even research area name class wrong equating calculus
He
He said CS often time deal pure math
That response someone asking CS student must take calculus
In fact depressing number comment thread answering Why math
instead Why calculus
Well Calc kind gateway class higher math
Sure version statistic physic class assume know Calc suck wo convinced many claim make derived using Calc
So OP asks Calc important CS everyone answer math important CS Calc viewed many necessary prerequisite real application math anything
It like someone asking walking important gymnastics everyone answering balance important gymnastics
All higher math
That rather extreme position take
In entire math major class really relied differential equation real analysis better statistic class I would required
In one linear algebra class differentiation come example linear operator exactly critical class material
In semester half graph theory semester half combinatorics two linear algebra two abstract algebra one cryptography one code use calculus
I think common misconception computer science I mean well advertised
I remember applying university trying pick computer science software engineering could figure difference
I got lucky picked computer science ended loving theory side way programming side got lucky haha
I struggled theory side still benefited
Now I work job theory I struggled applied familiar context end goal coming back
They different conceptually job market
Computer Science remains preferred degree large software company reason student enter program
I assure position compaines benefit let alone require Calculus
If Computer Science purist want get PhD research new algorithm yup need calc
If like u wanting make six figure making new tech computer need
I disagree six figure tech job tend require benefit advanced math
The way I see two reason pay someone lot money tech They managing large team leading project big impact bottom line otherwise shouldering lot responsibility
This may require much math job likely get right undergraduate school right graduate school matter
It take experience going get
They extremely productive individual immediately recognizing get past important technical hurdle get stuff implemented
Here advanced math super important
Programmers follow instruction Go make widget website dime dozen
You need pay nose get someone week
Much better pay big buck programmer go implement widget day come back tell Oh I noticed backend really dumb O n scan python could done one join database
And earth tail latency crappy
Is problem caching strategy
What I saying end game employee want make lot money key part work
No one going give responsibility good bit work experience demonstrable skill
Until best bet productivity machine mean math skill understand improve system mention ability demonstrate engineer interviewing overcome technical problem face
I think familiar programmer salary
You mock dime dozen folk starting salary silicon valley high cost living area
Add matching bonus well
You definitely need expert anything make six figure
Calculus hardly advanced math This need constantly define programming different computer science getting tired
It seems I read type comment every post whenever anyone say I want programmer major Computer Science people always go nut thing
Programming big part beginning theory later course
If someone interested programming living else would major
Programming tool
CS finding efficiently use tool tool might come across
Software engineering
Are software engineering degree place CS course class side
legitimate question Many university offer CS degree
Mine software engineering option
In school software engineering focus within Computer Science degree
So AI Web Development Data Management Computer Graphics Animation Game Development etc
They grouped Computer Science
Each subject specific study become known focus within Computer Science degree
Within field graphic calculus integral hah performing convolution filter base image
In addition necessary calculate reflection refraction Ray tracer
Within field algorithm design calculus necessary calculating run time well many many optimization algorithm gradient descent example
Compression algorithm require understanding Fourier cosine transforms well matrix operation
Source major
calculus necessary calculating run time Is
Can please elaborate point
I saw argument couple time thread I fail see calculus actually applicable area complexity analysis
In general case calculus useful applying Master Theorem
However many specific delightful us calculus proving runtimes specific algorithm
One favorite example proving reshuffling algorithm heap linear time
The proof involves construction Taylor polynomial requiring least second semester calculus
Master Theorem Are talking theorem
I reckon requires calculus
One favorite example proving reshuffling algorithm heap linear time
The proof involves construction Taylor polynomial requiring least second semester calculus
Hm got
But said specific case
Perhaps directly master theorem familiarity math certainly help
As example consider bound established Shannon entropy Huffman encoding
I know much information theory really need advanced calculus deriving shannon entropy
Also topology used specifying lower bound class problem described algebraic computational tree
Yet CS student forced take topology class Shannon derivation become realized large value That require limit fundamental building block calculus
If looking justification need calculus I sure find
But trust want computer scientist code monkey need calculus
As I said limit calculus
Surely calculus class people make use special case limit
But limit important teach people general topology
want computer scientist code monkey need calculus What need way calculus combinatorics logic
Bad math determined CS
So I went local community college took class semester starting studied like demon
Made algebra precalc trig A
Calculus brain mush first I invested tutor visited uni math resource center almost daily clicked next semester calc pretty easy
It took long time doable
You use later education various analysis discipline curriculum Operational Research similar part need
Depending field go Calc big part scientific endeavor
But honest key Calc learning manipulate equation symbol symbolic manipulation key programming activity
I found school like use Calculus mean limiting number people seeking CS degree difficulty
While Calculus highly useful necessary CS Linear Algebra opinion
Calculus hard enough weeding class
Yes objectively
It difficult grasp first people might wrestle bit OK cover concept basic advanced math CS largely math degree
Derivation operation like addition subtraction
Calculus required psychology class people crammed hall listening teacher refusing explain thing foundational information three book assigned
It depends institution
My Calculus Science Engineering course pas rate many take twice even three time
The material might difficult grasp exam lab might
Labs
In calculus
Your psychology class sound like calculus class I take
It similar school I feel like discrete math tends fill role
I find whole We going teach essential skill want weed people major gon na make fight like pit dog meat tossed
unethical I paying teach
If going I like refund
People starting different level experience
It fair race half people head start
You may developmental biology class Rutgers person competing TA sorority sister roommate lab essentially becomes personal tutoring session
No I bitter
deleted Calculus pretty much required science
With computer science computing math
Higher level math different lower level math use
As get higher level involving proof might even look like math
This understanding computer thing issue involving direct job training
You probably use math workforce capacity job related automating task using computer hand
I remember I part committee help redesign university Computer Science curriculum student complaining take many math class
Then I brought point I never known great programmer struggled math
Are know anyone could pas calc ended successful programmer
If want machine analysis going need solid bit calculus
Not everyone computer science go route quite helpful many area CS
Well really depends course work going take
We different concentration university eventually turning major
Software Engineering Computer Engineering Graphics
Computer Engineering definitely need calculus huge part physic
One larger scale project design create circuit board understanding magnetism electricity help
Calculus prerequisite physic
The highest level math course I really needed software engineering statistic really managerial position
We learned way use number help determine good code v bad code course number alone
But statistic experience definitely helped although Excel work lol
For graphic Linear Algebra huge
Mostly taught lot matrix operation operation transforms translation done matrix operation
In math course help understand machine work general
You get without knowing intricacy going write code ever else kind point comp sci
Edit I even feel comfortable saying point comp sci XD
We always taught look code tool problem solving using computing theory actual thing
You wo directly use lot calculus upper lever computer science class could probably take CS core class without ever computing integral
However lot theoretical concept require level mathematical sophistication unlikely without strong foundation calculus
For example This thread linked elsewhere reddit
Most university I loved requires Calc We actually go Calc also take physic
I really miss
I would say emphasized required sure emphasized
I never really saw come outside physic image processing
You use certain algorithm implement
For example gradient descent
Most upper div c course like machine learning big data computer vision use LOT math
There also good chance run lot linear algebra dealing graphic image processing etc
Calculus necessary stochastic turn integral pursuit basically anything science
I ca believe made take way Multi
Seems unnecessary
It
There really much calc needed
I ca remember last integral I actual CS
Because similar major science engineering mathematics require calculus
Most branch science require significant use statistical analysis
If know least calculus really understand statistic
Engineering program require calculus traditional branch heavy physic component
If know least calculus truly understand physic
Plus I went school every engineering major take field course kind generally electromagnetic theory fluid mechanic
These fundamentally require calculus
Calculus fundamental mathematics I ca even imagine could construct math major without
I always wondered question I taking analysis algorithm course I go back review basic Calc stuff
I think emphasized one course much
CS discrete math calculus
Minimization easier think thing shape try reduce nothing
CS mostly math computer
It science computing thing
The concept taught calculus fundamental addition multiplication
You going get far without
I struggled math I wanted software work computer
I know exactly meant long run I succeeded mostly I worked hard
I barely squeaking calc I got calc beyond I started working hard figured
Now I got C calc I failing start succeeding end
That I learned grade matter
talk math class important
Not keep suspense I got BS CS MS Controls robotics
Aside struggling algebra might general struggle math may traced back far elementary school
Working hard simple stuff like multiply divide two number hand help
It teach follow series step algorithm order solve problem
Algebra much larger subject imagine
I kept learning I done taking math class MS degree
I often time algebra I programming
You keep learning practicing time
So worry struggling long keep
The calculus important mathematical maturity
Discrete math used heavily computer science
Technically need high school algebra learn discrete math
That said exposure math higher level may seen high school better preparation course
You need somewhat familiar proof completely rock solid algebra simply stated practice help
Also school giving
degree probably implied seen calculus
Tradition
Calculus matter lot discrete math algebra combinatorics fractal geometry chaos
But historically calculus strong hold science engineering
It might matter also Calculus overlap well many major

If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

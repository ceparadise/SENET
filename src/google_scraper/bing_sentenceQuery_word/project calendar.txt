What Computer Science
Despite name Computer Science really science computer
Computers quite remarkable electronic device even remarkable made simulate flow air wing manage communication Internet control action robot synthesize realistic image play chess
Indeed application computer activity like affected area modern life
What task common little physic electronics computer matter formulated sort computation
This real subject matter Computer Science computation done computationally
In trying make sense get computer wide variety topic come
There however two recurring theme
The first issue scale big system specify without getting lost design big task computer handle within reasonable bound time memory accuracy
A large part Computer Science deal question one form another
In area programming language methodology example look notation describing computation programming methodology facilitate production manageable efficient software
In theory computation area study resource requirement time memory many basic computational task
The second theme concern scope computation
Computers originally conceived purely numerical calculator today tend view much broadly
Part Computer Science concerned understanding far computational idea applied
In area artificial intelligence example ask much intelligent behaviour people expressed computational term
In area interaction ask sort normal activity people might supported augmented using computer

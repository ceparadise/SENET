Instead sequential design process Agile methodology follows incremental approach
Developers start simplistic project design begin work small module
The work module done weekly monthly sprint end sprint project priority evaluated test run
These sprint allow bug discovered customer feedback incorporated design next sprint run
The process lack initial design step often criticized collaborative nature focus principle rather process
At outset I say Agile evolutionary methodology Unified Process focus Iterative Incremental Development IID
IID emphasizes iterative development construction phase actual coding incremental delivery
It would emphasize Requirements Analysis Inception Design Elaboration handled iteration
So Iteration mini project
In Agile take IDD bit adding reality like Team Collaboration Evolutionary Requirements Design etc
And SCRUM tool enable considering human factor building around Group principle
So Sprint mini project bettering pure IID model
So iteration implemented Agile way yes theoretically Sprints highlighting size iteration small delivery quick
I really differentiate Agile SCRUM I see SCRUM natural way putting Agile principle use

The framework often part named rugby formation
Everyone play role
When come product development Scrum role include Scrum development team
Product owner This team member serf liaison development team customer
The product owner responsible ensuring expectation completed product communicated agreed upon
Scrum master This team member serf facilitator
The Scrum master responsible ensuring Scrum carried project able move forward
Scrum development team This group work together creating testing incremental final product
The Scrum process encourages practitioner work continually evaluate working working
Communication important part process carried meeting called Events
Scrum Events include
The Daily Scrum short meeting happens place time day
At meeting team review work completed previous day plan work done next hour
This time team member speak problem might prevent project completion

A refers time frame work must completed often day
Everyone participates setting goal end least one increment usable piece software produced

This time show increment

A Sprint meeting held Sprint end
During meeting everyone reflects Sprint process
A exercise may also offered
An important goal Sprint Retrospective
An artifact something historical interest deserves looked
In Scrum product development artifact used see done still
Scrum artifact include product backlog Sprint backlog product increment useful look Sprint Planning Meetings

This refers remains done list
During product backlog grooming session development team work business owner prioritize work backlogged
The product backlog may process called backlog refinement

This list task must completed selected product backlog item delivered
These divided
This refers accomplished Sprint product backlog item well created previous Sprints
The product increment reflects much progress made
The visual representation amount work still need completed
A chart Y axis work X axis time

In Ken Schwaber Sutherland working others including McKenna Scumniotales presented influential entitled SCRUM Development Process
The result made developer question effectiveness classic
According Agile team today use Scrum
The three pillar Scrum transparency inspection adaptation supported five value commitment courage focus openness respect
Commitment The team member dedicated completing work agreed upon

framework managing work emphasis
It designed team three nine developer break work action completed within timeboxed iteration called typically track progress called
Approaches coordinating work multiple scrum team larger organization include among others
Scrum iterative incremental framework managing product development
It defines flexible product development strategy development team work unit reach common goal challenge assumption traditional sequential approach product development enables team encouraging physical close online collaboration team member well daily communication among team member discipline involved
A key principle Scrum dual recognition customer change mind want need often called requirement volatility unpredictable predictive planned approach suited
As Scrum adopts problem fully understood defined front instead focusing maximize team ability deliver quickly respond emerging requirement adapt evolving technology change market condition
Many term used Scrum scrum master typically written leading capital Scrum Master conjoint word written ScrumMaster
To maintain encyclopedic tone however article us normal sentence case recognized mark
This occasionally seen written SCRUM
The word correct however likely arose due early paper Ken Schwaber capitalized SCRUM title
While term Scrum allowed lapse deemed owned wider community rather individual leading capital used word
Hirotaka Takeuchi introduced term scrum context article New New Product Development Game
Takeuchi Nonaka later argued The Knowledge Creating Company form organizational knowledge creation especially good bringing innovation continuously incrementally spirally
The author described new approach commercial product development would increase speed flexibility based case study manufacturing firm automotive photocopier printer
They called approach whole process performed one across multiple overlapping phase team try go distance unit passing ball back forth
In used restart play forward team interlock head attempt gain possession ball
In early used would become Scrum company Advanced Development Methods John Scumniotales Jeff McKenna developed similar approach Easel Corporation referring using single word Scrum
In Sutherland Schwaber jointly presented paper describing Scrum framework Business Object Design Implementation Workshop held part OOPSLA Austin Texas
Over following year Schwaber Sutherland collaborated combine experience evolving good develop became known Scrum
In Schwaber worked Mike Beedle describe method book
Scrum approach planning managing product development involves bringing authority level operation property certainty
In Schwaber others founded Scrum Alliance set accreditation series
Schwaber left Scrum Alliance late founded oversees parallel accreditation series
Since public document called defines sort official version Scrum occasionally revised
There three core role Scrum framework
These ideally deliver potentially shippable product increment every sprint
Together three role form scrum team
While many organization role involved defining delivering product Scrum defines three
The product owner represents product accountable ensuring team delivers value business
The product owner defines product term typically add based importance dependency
Scrum team one product owner
This role combined scrum master
The product owner focus business side product development spend majority time liaising stakeholder dictate team reach technical solution
This role equivalent role agile framework XP
Communication core responsibility product owner
The ability convey priority empathize team member stakeholder vital steer product development right direction
The product owner role bridge communication gap team stakeholder serving proxy stakeholder team team representative overall stakeholder community
As face team stakeholder following communication task product owner stakeholder Empathy key attribute product owner ability put one self another shoe
A product owner converse different stakeholder variety background job role objective
A product owner must able see different point view
To effective wise product owner know level detail audience need
The development team need thorough feedback specification build product expectation executive sponsor may need summary progress
Providing information necessary may lose stakeholder interest waste time
A direct mean communication preferred seasoned agile product owner
A product owner ability communicate effectively also enhanced skilled technique identify stakeholder need negotiate priority stakeholder interest collaborate developer ensure effective implementation requirement
The development team responsible delivering potentially shippable product increment every sprint sprint goal
The team three nine member carry task required build product increment analysis design development testing technical writing etc
Although several discipline represented team member referred generically
To avoid potential confusion refers programmer organization call member
The development team Scrum even though may interaction role outside team PMO
Scrum facilitated scrum master accountable removing impediment ability team deliver product goal deliverable
The scrum master traditional act buffer team distracting influence
The scrum master ensures Scrum framework followed
The scrum master help ensure team follows agreed process Scrum framework often facilitates key session encourages team improve
The role also referred team facilitator reinforce dual perspective
The core responsibility scrum master include limited One way scrum master role differs project manager latter may responsibility scrum master
Scrum formally recognise role project manager traditional command control tendency would cause difficulty
A sprint iteration basic unit development Scrum
The sprint effort restricted specific duration
The duration fixed advance sprint normally one week one month two week common
Each sprint start sprint planning event aim define sprint backlog identify work sprint make estimated forecast sprint goal
Each sprint end sprint review sprint retrospective review progress show stakeholder identify lesson improvement next sprint
Scrum emphasizes working product end sprint really done
In case software likely includes software fully integrated tested documented potentially shippable
At beginning sprint scrum team hold sprint planning event Each day sprint team hold daily scrum specific guideline Any impediment stumbling block risk issue delayed dependency assumption proved unfounded identified daily scrum captured scrum master displayed team scrum board shared risk board agreed person designated working toward resolution outside daily scrum
No detailed discussion happen daily scrum
At end sprint team hold two event sprint review sprint retrospective
At sprint review team Guidelines sprint review At sprint retrospective team Guidelines sprint retrospective The following activity commonly done although considered core part Scrum Backlog refinement called backlog grooming ongoing process reviewing product backlog item checking appropriately prioritised prepared way make clear executable team enter sprint via sprint planning activity
Product backlog item may broken multiple smaller one acceptance criterion may clarified dependency investigation preparatory work may identified agreed technical spike
Although originally core Scrum practice backlog refinement added scrum guide adopted way managing quality product backlog item entering sprint recommended investment team sprint capacity
The backlog also include technical debt also known design debt code debt
This concept software development reflects implied cost additional rework caused choosing easy solution instead using better approach would take longer
The product owner cancel sprint necessary
The product owner may input team scrum master management
For instance management may wish product owner cancel sprint external circumstance negate value sprint goal
If sprint abnormally terminated next step conduct new sprint planning reason termination reviewed
The product backlog comprises ordered list scrum team maintains
It consists must done successfully deliver viable product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item PBIs based consideration risk business value dependency size date needed
Items added backlog commonly written story format
The product backlog delivered ordered sequence delivered
It visible everyone may changed consent product owner ultimately responsible ordering product backlog item development team choose
The product backlog contains product owner assessment business value development team assessment development effort often always stated using
These estimate help product owner gauge timeline may influence ordering product backlog item example two feature business value product owner may schedule earlier delivery one lower development effort higher one higher development effort complex riskier want retire risk earlier
The product backlog business value product backlog item responsibility product owner
The size
estimated complexity effort item however determined development team contributes sizing story point estimated hour
There common misunderstanding allowed product backlog
By contrast Scrum neutral requirement technique
As Scrum primer state product backlog item articulated way clear sustainable
Contrary popular misunderstanding product backlog contain user story simply contains item
Those item expressed user story requirement approach group find useful
But whatever approach item focus delivering value customer
Scrum advocate role product owner assigned
The product owner responsible maximizing value product
The product owner gather input take feedback lobbied many people ultimately make call get built
The product backlog Typically product owner scrum team come together write everything must prioritized becomes content first block time meant focused work selected item accommodated within timeframe
The product backlog evolve new information surface product customer later sprint may address new work
The following item typically comprise product backlog feature bug technical work knowledge acquisition
A feature wanted bug unintended unwanted may necessarily something defective
An example technical work could run virus check developer workstation
An example knowledge acquisition could research Wordpress plugin library making selection
A product backlog simplest form merely list item work
Having rule work added removed ordered help whole team make better decision change product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item based needed soonest
The team chooses item complete coming sprint
On scrum board team move item product backlog sprint backlog list item build
Conceptually ideal team select think accomplish top list unusual see practice team able take item list along top one selected
This normally happens time left within sprint accommodate work
Items top backlog item work first broken story suitable development team work
The backlog go le refined item
As Schwaber Beedle put The lower priority le detail barely make backlog item
As team work backlog must assumed change happens outside team learn new market opportunity take advantage competitor threat arise feedback customer change way product meant work
All new idea tend trigger team adapt backlog incorporate new knowledge
This part fundamental mindset agile team
The world change backlog never finished
The sprint backlog list work development team must address next sprint
The list derived scrum team progressively selecting product backlog item priority order top product backlog feel enough work fill sprint
The development team keep mind past performance assessing capacity new sprint use guide line much complete
The product backlog item may broken task development team
Tasks sprint backlog never assigned rather task signed team member needed according set priority skill team
This promotes development team developer
The sprint backlog property development team included estimate provided development team
Often accompanying task board used see change state task current sprint like progress done
Once sprint backlog committed additional work added sprint backlog except team
Once sprint delivered product backlog analyzed reprioritized necessary next set functionality selected next sprint
The increment potentially shippable increment PSI sum product backlog item completed sprint integrated work previous sprint
At end sprint increment must complete according scrum team definition done DoD fully functioning usable condition regardless whether product owner decides actually release
The following artifact commonly used although considered core part Scrum The sprint chart public displayed chart showing remaining work sprint backlog
Updated every day give simple view sprint progress
It also provides quick visualization reference
The horizontal axis sprint chart show day sprint vertical axis show amount work remaining day typically representing estimate hour work remaining
During sprint planning ideal burndown chart plotted
Then sprint member pick task sprint backlog work
At end day update remaining hour task completed
In way actual burndown chart updated day day
It confused
The release chart way team provide visibility track progress toward release
Updated end sprint show progress toward delivering forecast scope
The horizontal axis release chart show sprint release vertical axis show amount work completed end sprint typically representing cumulative story point work completed
Progress plotted line grows meet horizontal line represents forecast scope often shown forecast based progress date indicates much scope might completed given release date many sprint take complete given scope
The release chart make easy see much work completed much work added removed horizontal scope line move much work left done
The determine whether product backlog item complete
In many case DoD requires successful
The definition done may vary one scrum team another must consistent within one team
The total effort team capable sprint
The number derived evaluating work typically point completed last sprint
The collection historical velocity data guideline assisting team understanding much work likely achieve future sprint
A period used research concept create simple prototype
Spikes either planned take place sprint larger team spike might accepted one many sprint delivery objective
Spikes often introduced delivery large complex product backlog item order secure budget expand knowledge produce proof concept
The duration objective spike agreed product owner development team start
Unlike sprint commitment spike may may deliver tangible shippable valuable functionality
For example objective spike might successfully reach decision course action
The spike time necessarily objective delivered
Also called drone spike tracer bullet spike current architecture current technology set current set best practice result production quality code
It might narrow implementation functionality throwaway code
It production quality rest iteration build code
The name military origin make path bullet visible allowing correction
Often implementation shot layer application connecting single form input field prove layer connect expected
Scrum work le well following circumstance From business perspective Scrum many virtue one designed yield best business solution
However efficiency given organization vary widely largely dependent ability organization adhere implementation guideline article
Every company distinct organizational structure culture set business practice naturally amenable methodology others
Like agile method effective adoption Scrum supported wide range tool
Many company use universal tool spreadsheet build maintain artifact sprint backlog
There also proprietary software package either dedicated product development using Scrum framework support multiple product development approach including Scrum
Other organization implement Scrum without software tool maintain artifact form paper whiteboards sticky note
Scrum empirical approach like empirical process control underpinned three pillar transparency inspection adaptation
All work within Scrum framework visible responsible outcome process workflow progress etc
In order make thing visible scrum team need frequently inspect product developed well team working
With frequent inspection team spot work deviate outside acceptable limit adapt process product development
These three pillar require trust openness team following five value Scrum enable The hybridization Scrum software development methodology common Scrum cover whole therefore organization find need add additional process create comprehensive implementation
For example start product development organization commonly add process guidance business case requirement gathering prioritization initial design budget schedule forecasting
Various author community people use Scrum also suggested detailed technique apply adapt Scrum particular problem organization
Many refer methodological technique analogy architecture software
Such pattern extended Scrum outside software development domain Manufacturing Finance
Scrumban software production model based Scrum
Scrumban especially suited frequent unexpected work item programming error
In case sprint Scrum framework may perceived le benefit although Scrum daily event practice still applied depending team situation hand
Visualization work stage limitation simultaneous unfinished work defect familiar Kanban model
Using method team directed way allows minimum completion time work item programming error hand ensures team member constantly employed
To illustrate stage work team working space often use note large whiteboard
In case decentralized team software
The major difference Scrum Kanban Scrum work divided sprint last fixed amount time whereas Kanban flow work continuous
This visible work stage table Scrum emptied sprint whereas Kanban task marked table
Scrum focus team multifaceted whereas Kanban make specialized functional team possible
The scrum scrum technique operate Scrum scale multiple team working product allowing discus progress interdependency focusing coordinate delivering software especially area overlap integration
Depending cadence timing scrum scrum relevant daily scrum scrum team end designating one member ambassador participate scrum scrum ambassador team
Depending context ambassador may technical contributor team scrum master
Rather simply progress update scrum scrum focus team collectively working resolve mitigate accept risk impediment dependency assumption RIDAs identified
The scrum scrum track RIDAs via backlog risk board sometimes known initial resolved owned accepted mitigated typically lead greater coordination collaboration team
This run similar daily scrum ambassador answering following four question As commented Since I originally defined Scrum Scrums Ken Schwaber IDX working I definitively say Scrum Scrums meta Scrum
The Scrum Scrums I used responsible delivering working software team Definition Done end sprint release sprint
PatientKeeper delivered production four time per Sprint
delivers production time per Sprint
Hubspot delivers live software time day
The Scrum Scrums Master held accountable making work
So Scrum Scrums operational delivery mechanism
scrum LeSS product development framework extends Scrum scaling rule guideline without losing original purpose Scrum
There two level framework first LeSS level designed team second level known LeSS Huge introduces additional scaling element development hundred developer
Scaling Scrum start understanding able adopt standard real Scrum
Scrum requires examining purpose Scrum element figuring reach purpose staying within constraint standard Scrum rule
Bas Vodde evolved LeSS framework experience working product development especially telecom finance industry
It evolved taking Scrum trying many different experiment discover work
In experiment solidified LeSS framework rule

If think scrum seems like odd word apply project management would right considering origin
come word scrummage term used sport rugby
Rugby team use scrummage scrum something happened stop game example ball leaf playing field think basketball
To restart game player stand close together head interlocked
In formation move one one person make step others must take step well
So term used rugby applied project management
In scrum formation team member work one unit
Does make sense team business also work one unit
Where one team member take step affect team member step
Originally term scrum used framework software development
became known process improved teamwork ensuring communication team member resulted faster completion goal
Eventually teamwork process applied project management particular solve complex problem project multiple element needed completed
Let take look scrum process
Scrum break large complex product smaller manageable increment completed every sprint
Each sprint completed turn resulting completed project
But specific step using scrum
Let take look Now know process work let take look people make scrum team
Scrum team generally meaning people team different area expertise
They something valuable contribute ultimate goal completing project
There three position job found scrum team The responsible maximizing value product work team
The product owner help prioritize team work determines work meet stakeholder requirement
The team consists professional work delivering potentially releasable increment product end sprint
The responsible ensuring Scrum understood enacted
Scrum master ensuring Scrum team adheres Scrum theory practice rule
So would organization want go seems like tedious process accomplish goal
There number advantage using scrum process Get FREE access day create account
term originally used rugby team formation became associated software development later project management call improved teamwork ensuring communication team member resulted faster completion project
The scrum team includes product owner scrum team
All member scrum team contribute success project member may change different skill required
The scrum process begin product owner creating narrative required
The scrum team develops list thing need done complete project
The scrum team begin implement completion list form sprint
last one four week
The scrum team meet daily ass progress sprint
Once sprint completed reviewed team performs retrospective ass went well need improvement future sprint
Some advantage using scrum process include better product quality estimate adaptability change

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I planning teach course mobile application development
I thinking best way structure course starting believe agile approach might merit
The idea The student senior junior one deliverable course end written mobile application make use web service location service graphical information display mobile database
Also student able use version control appropriate amount software design perform review others code incorporate automated manual testing project
Because nearing end study I believe showing real world agile project might work scope currently studying would good secondary goal
My question So look like based school calendar enough time introductory session four sprint final demo session two floating session available work
So two approach Assume product student knowledge mobile application development student select item generic backlog work sprint
Assume product mobile app must term functionality student define app produce user story
This seen Buffy noted
If done properly might case aim fill student knowledge gap
That need highly adaptive per student probably per topic area
If I product owner I get say whether met acceptance criterion know enough topic user story
If instead get another student product owner perhaps QA delegation PO idea pairing brought student come mutual understanding definition done
If product mobile application simplifies thing make agile approach closer software engineer would follow real work environment
Here I product owner I need understand possible apps student get choose app idea
Again might better delegated another student group student
Do subvert purpose essence agile development ability product owner project almost instantly make change adjustment backlog business condition dictate
The alternative specifying everything start failed repeatedly long running project make sense whatever follow initial plan
Some I write assumes future reader familiar terminology purpose various role task
To try complete would require
So You need separate developer group Devs product owner PO person group
I normally randomly thing might work
The PO control backlog release feature per iteration
The developer see whole thing overview form start
If want Devs estimation agile per iteration currently relevant card feature
Then give PO velocity determine many feature iteration
If project one term iteration short week
small
But even estimate time per task still give velocity seen feature desired
Otherwise frustrated much work little time
That lead burnout agile
The downside PO get develop
That may advantage depending makeup student group
I prefer PO I throw kink two along way
As say need prevent speculative development
You fierce rejecting attempt
Not showing entire backlog help simply rejecting feature produced speculatively needed
The problem student likely gotten one bad habit
They probably past given partly specified project assignment creativity valued
So try get creative definition ignoring need PO
In real world seldom work way Startups excepted need learn work someone else vision
So need make work class
The following speculative I tried
If really want every student experience every role Appoint PO somehow first iteration hold role throughout
Accepting rejecting guidance backlog item completed
Then end iteration rotate role old PO becomes developer student take PO role
They need time become familiar backlog however probably ca happen iteration end one day new PO take specifies next iteration immediately
A negative aspect old PO knowledge would reality may make eager speculate
I would also require skill sorry US baseball term Extreme Programming suggests

personal skill pairing test first etc
Pairing help teach one another build team skill
Another possibility course Agile Development though match stated requirement follows
I say others may benefit
Instead one large project bunch tiny project minute feature minute iteration
If run course hour segment made work
In fact I know one outfit sort thing real
large project maybe one hour iteration
With scheme person PO one project take different role next day
At point agile course trying realistic need throw sorry
Change fundamental way
Estimate current move usual
It really happens way experience also show word agile actually mean something
Trying make initial requirement precise also encourage speculation
Real agile project work way
The initial backlog pretty vague specification
It approach iteration feature appears becomes specific
You need guide PO sensible thing
You probably need project Coach
If need ease development could provide test unit test guide developer
After initially take
But need give advice coach quality test
Note I merged idea Scrum XP
Scrum work well overall management Backlogs acceptance XP day day task pairing testing
If require level skill student probably thrash
Agile requires discipline often missed especially reject
There say course
But bottom line need
The biggest issue I see taking curriculum trying approach using SCRUM term
The result lot almost SCRUM behavior could tremendously damaging
I seen many SCRUM team fail Product Owner Scrum Master forced almost SCRUM mentality team
Instead taking curriculum trying approach SCRUM term I recommend starting trying apply curriculum
The reason I think work better SCRUM designed produce product learning curriculum
Your curriculum necessarily designed operate SCRUM
Let SCRUM take charge good
One key aspect application going wear three hat Product Owner Scrum Master Manager
Manager actually SCRUM role essential stability
If real life SCRUM team refuse build sprint support Product Owner sufficiently That PO talk functional management team everyone receiving bad performance review year
The equivalent given bad grade
Thus support SCRUM process line item grade student
Maybe tell student first grade free unless disrupt SCRUM process enough force PO talk manager
If coach right think free A test something like
With ugly manager hat way look one
Product Owner interesting
Like industry PO obligation produce product customer administration child parent expect learning
Explain student wearing PO hat job deliver curriculum expectation customer
I would expect two major style behavior
If student curriculum PO operate like product owner would egging team produce product faster maybe giving freedom craft backlog way want see
However student falling behind
PO may able deliver learning customer student ameliorating sprint PO start tightening rein offering le agility instead picking way cover material probably boring talking Manager SCRUM grade
The student understand front
If start fall behind desire part resolve issue PO come take away freedom
It easy enough understand knowing game work key
Then Scrum Master
The SM known team
They facilitate team way needed make SCRUM team successful
Note different job description PO
You going need make clear acting SM acting PO
This might actually involve funny headgear might involve metacommunicating tell people acting
As example let recognize SCRUM effort experiment
It might actually fit well school model
What happens bad match
The first thing notice PO start get unhappy delivering learning
You falling behind schedule
The PO going push team produce
As SM need work try plan better sprint meet PO need
Now case looking case fails
Now PO extremely unhappy ready talk Manager bad team performing take away SCRUM support grade
At point might need metacommunication recover So I wanted try run class SCRUM setting
As seen email guy Product Owner I happy result
Your SCRUM effort simply working
At point real Product Owner real Scrum Master would sit talk going
They try identify root cause
So Scrum Master group I come table arguing team actually job task big
At point semester I Product Owner agree Scrum Master
You guy done job making SCRUM work best could
The curriculum fit
So Product Owner I deciding terminate SCRUM go back traditional teaching approach
Since clear guy job making work I going Manager try ding guy performance
You great
You get SCRUM support point
But instead part scrum going like Test
It like test study got A
Congratulations
Now back regularly scheduled classroom
Can see murky would blurred hat
It need clear process least person corner Scrum Master
If ca see may rebel idea
Now sprint planning last major challenge I think
There issue
One many people team
SCRUM team work best small number
A classroom likely many
You probably adapt sprint planning process fit reality
The challenge planning student expert
You
They really know enough break backlog item task fit sprint
As result may help
As part Product Backlog may want provide suggestion approach curriculum item Lecture Problem set A Problem set B Research along way estimating long task take
Let assign story point essential learning process SCRUM
If want try learn curriculum different way provided may need introduce concept Sprint Goal explain use provide cohesion
Also remember flexibility
As PO going demonstrate customer student learned material
That
If work find clever way demonstrate learning need learn always let deviate obvious curriculum
If teaching socket really need backlog item Learn use
Or add new item use asynchronous thread add functionality awesome product produced last sprint
The answer really depends much freedom curriculum
The main problem probably
Some pupil see product backlog start working ahead time This good far probably work time AHHH
Therefore release backlog start
Insure teach Work In ProgressÂ bad keep releasing
There may learning dependency mean item delivered early
If pupil chose would problem
Therefore carefully choose initial set backlog contains item suitable early stage
But later dependency considered student could mark invisible one backlog aware
You could Give agile A Bad Name
Ensure know Agile well
I worked many developer say work I tried They tried someone heard Agile good relabelled bad practice Or learn properly made something

Women represent majority young university graduate still underrepresented science technology engineering mathematics computer science STEM field
This article provides information woman university degree examines whether mathematical ability high school related gender difference university program
In Canada elsewhere world encouraging university student choose program science technology engineering mathematics computer science known program long defining outcome national innovation strategy
The focus degree related would contribute country competitiveness economic prosperity
Given scope nature labour market instance engaging research development graduate considered key input national innovation system
At individual level previous report also suggested degree would lead better labour market condition higher earnings especially background engineering computer science
That said despite advance made recent year woman remain le likely choose career area particularly engineering mathematics computer science
This stand contrast nearly field study woman represent vast majority health social science program
Why woman staying away program
This article examines gender difference program choice graduation
First profile difference men woman among recent university graduate aged using data National Household Survey NHS
It also examines whether university graduate better labour market outcome university graduate
In second part article factor associated university program choice examined men woman using longitudinal data Youth Transition International Student Assessment
Of particular interest relationship mathematical ability age choosing university program
Young adult likely obtain university degree regardless gender
However woman made gain much rapidly men recent year
In proportion men woman aged university degree proportion increased among woman among men
As result university graduate aged female
The share female university graduate increased nearly field study including program
Hence university graduate aged female compared graduate aged
However woman represented graduate aged proportion range health profession related program education program
Women thus proportionately among graduate least compared field
Furthermore woman degree particularly concentrated science technology program
Specifically woman accounted graduate university degree science technology accounted graduate aged university degree engineering degree mathematics computer science
Thus woman aged degree background engineering mathematics computer science Chart
In comparison men background field engineering mathematics computer science
The better labour market outcome young graduate degree often used motivational factor encourage student choose degree
Labour market condition however may vary across gender type program indicator labour market performance
One indicator unemployment rate
In unemployment rate men aged university degree compared university degree
For woman opposite unemployment rate woman university degree compared among degree Table
Percentage person working occupation requiring high school education le
Includes person employed NHS reference week employed last worked
Similar difference found group sample restricted employee working full year
Gross wage salary deduction employee working full year full time
Men university degree also le likely graduate working occupation requiring high school education form mismatch
Among men aged university degree occupation generally requiring high school diploma le compared among university degree
Among woman graduate occupation requiring high school diploma le percentage similar woman university degree
Examining skill mismatch within group also important may help explain larger proportion female university graduate occupation requiring high school diploma le compared male counterpart
In university science graduate employed occupation requiring high school diploma le compared engineering degree
Therefore relatively higher mismatch rate female university graduate explained part larger share program higher mismatch rate example science lower share program like engineering
Similarly relatively lower mismatch rate female university graduate compared male counterpart explained least part fact many woman graduated program mismatch rate relatively example education health profession related program
That program would also lead job often used selling point encourage youth pursue program
According NHS true even men men aged university degree employed basis earned median versus graduated program
The gap smaller among woman graduate employed median salary wage compared graduate
If men earning men however largely concentrated engineering earnings significantly higher
Men degree engineering earned compared men degree science technology earned
Conversely woman degree science technology graduate significantly le woman degree engineering
Past study attempted understand woman le likely men enter complete university program
For gender difference mathematical prerequisite success field explain fewer woman found program
For others gender gap rather difference value preference
Which assumption supported data
Longitudinal data Youth Transition Survey Program International Student Assessment used better understand relationship mathematical ability choice university program among men woman
The interviewed sample youth aged every two year
With data key educational characteristic measured adolescence including test conducted student aged thus linked measure collected subsequent year including program choice university see
Overall men sample went university early adulthood opted program first choice university woman Chart
In fact young woman much likely choose first program social science compared men among went university
Those chose program higher test score chose program Table
For example woman chose program obtained average mathematics score age compared among headed social science
Among men chose program achieved score average compared among chose social science
Males also tended higher score woman average versus
p p indicates significance gender difference In order control mathematical proficiency level sample divided higher score age mathematics proficiency level score lower score level
Those higher mathematics proficiency level likely choose program counterpart lower proficiency level
For example woman higher mathematics score entered program compared lower score Table
That said woman score le likely choose university program men score versus
In fact among woman social science preferred regardless mathematical proficiency
Men contrast always likely choose program even among lower proficiency mathematics
When high school mark mathematics examined instead score Chart similar result found also contains measure mathematical ability high school excellent good good fair poor
With respect mathematical ability young men typically better opinion perceived ability good excellent compared young woman
Again perceived mathematical skill positively likely choose program later university
Among youth attended university perceived mathematics skill good male opted program compared female
Furthermore male perceived skill excellent chose program compared female
Therefore still gender difference even among better perception mathematical ability
In summary student stronger score higher mark better perception academic ability high school likely opt university program
Nevertheless young men always inclined choose program young woman given level mathematical ability regardless measure
Are finding factor could influence program choice taken account including immigration status parental influence variable reading score
By large answer yes
When factor except mark mathematical ability accounted model including respondent attended university men higher lower mathematics score still likely enter field woman higher score Table model
Specifically men high score likely choose program margin percentage point woman equally high score
In addition men lower score also likely choose program woman higher score margin percentage point
Conversely men always le likely choose program social science margin percentage point among men lower score percentage point among men higher score
The inclusion mark mathematical ability Table model positively correlated choice program effect gender probability choosing program slightly percentage point percentage point among student higher score
p p indicates significant difference reference ref category As result men found program better score woman
In fact even measure mathematical ability combined model gender difference remain significant
This suggests gender difference selection program university due unobserved factor go beyond academic achievement parental interaction influence immigration status
Over past decade woman made significant advance university participation including program area previously populated men
One area however remains science technology engineering mathematical STEM degree
And among woman choose pursue degree biology science program resulting even fewer woman engineering computer science mathematics program
These choice consequence field study engineering computer science lead average better outcome labour market term employment job match earnings
For aptitude particular subject factor university program choice
Although mathematical ability play role explain gender difference choice
Young woman high level mathematical ability significantly le likely enter field young men even young men lower level mathematical ability
This suggests gender gap program due factor
Other possible explanation might include difference labour market expectation including family work balance difference motivation interest influence

people I never seen Pa cry tear joy day parent surprised u first PC
With combined annual income family five Mexican immigrant parent sacrificed much give u best chance academically successful future
Shooting star darted u excitement unpacked computer system back father Chevy truck
My older brother took lead setting mysterious digital box
We watched wrote first command screen
two decade
My brother computing professional
Somewhere along way sister I developed fear breaking computer punch wrong code click wrong application resorted word processing practicing typing skill playing solitaire
Our gendered difference computer uncommon
In male represented percent computing workforce percent female
The male delineated European Asian ancestry mostly
My brother exception
In stark contrast percent female represented cultural heritage Western Hemisphere
In Mississippi Montana Wyoming
In addition striking segregation computer science consumerist society addicted digital advancement capital gain
We surrounded computing technology marketing technique urge u latest version digitals
Our consumption technological advancement easily come without critical consciousness effect computing environment
The real price love affair faster efficient technology unintended consequence pernicious mountain
Studies show toxic especially burned recycled uncontrolled environment
In million short ton pound discarded landfill
Diversity matter
Not meet statistical quota matter
The complexity problem face society require collective approach theory experimentation solving dilemma
The movement resolving today serious problem rest hand one cultural group decision motivated fascination advancement tool cost environment
We must expand collective participation computing responsibly address problem face nourishing multiplicity worldviews education
born three year research study conducted Los Angeles
The central focus ancestral computing culturally situated approach computer science education
This approach involves establishing relationship Earth ancestral knowledge system together learning multiple facet computer science
During three year study focused interdisciplinary work computer science Los Angeles high school I found student made connection familial ancestral knowledge system computer science student increased positive sense self academic contributor knowledge production otherwise segregated field
In addition motivation academic success increased especially among female
Grounded critical consciousness positionalities generation shared connection Earth ancestral computing foreground issue positive identity formation responsibility Earth
My parent able buy u computer creative strategy
Recycling waste local restaurant bar allowed save penny offer u chance engaging advanced educational practice
In Ancient Mexico effigy found various place associated eating trash result make world better place
Learning ancestral knowledge practice making connection family behavior around recycling philosophy medicine planting sowing strengthened identity part long line creative contributor knowledge
My passion revealing generational knowledge recognized organization MEChA high school I conducting research computer science
The organization leader asked sponsor club
My formal position high school educational researcher class informal position MEChA sponsor
My participation world led I asked How might ancestral knowledge system computer science inquiry environmental sustainability
As consider way underserved population learn computing must build culturally responsive curriculum pedagogy
Both privilege academic success critical consciousness cultural sustainability
For example student may taught code rarely taught think effect computer production overall planet
This may help student make connection though often overlooked historical practice computational thinking
And may help preserve ancestral cultural way
Using ancestral computing sustainable approach broaden participation computer science education feed three bird one hand Critical thinking around ancestral computing brings question like Our first responsibility Earth entity directly give u life
Ancestral knowledge system world generally focus local environmental consideration connect body Earth beneath u around u spiritually physically
These teaching transcend time space derive documented ancient civilization across globe
Having system accountability business individual nurturing health planet crucial continued production technological tool
These accountability system account multiple point view well provide practical tool connection immediate environment inhabit particularly urban setting
Educational setting provide fertile ground ancestral computing practice flourish spill area entrepreneurship production consumerism responsible dignified manner
My initial question dropping math major
You write noticed woman person Mexican descent
This strike reason drop major
You could easily stayed pioneered presence mathematics
You
Why
You may think nonsensical question seems reason shift computer culture something I issue explained without hope make difference individual life member group person personal interest
Hi Donald Thank comment
Your first question experience dropping math major undergraduate student Pomona College
When I initially came Pomona I strong identity doer mathematics
I student high school qualified take Calculus I took class local community college school offer
But I went PC I experienced culture shock put question capacity knowledge producer
Most student class strikingly different term class gender cultural background
The implicit explicit message I received elite private institution student stakeholder culture place ivory tower academia
It experience led ask different question I could explore mathematical study Given PC geographical context college reflect demographic greater metropolis
Why Mexican Americans college like PC
What relationship immigration law educational attainment group
How Mexican policy contribute poverty low educational attainment citizen
Exploring question space equipped better serve underserved student field
My work enabled utilize critical perspective addressing issue power valuing cultural contribution underserved community academic practice field
Cueponcaxochitl Donald I also noted segment blog author detail dropping math
My analysis return mathematics research work ancestral computing impact program high school drew female student
Although cursory I highlighting author return initial issue deepened understanding cultural connection mathematics undergirding computer science
I ponder quality characteristic ancestral knowledge group
How might conversation need care Earth demonstrate urgency redefine talent goal consumerist society
This work help improve computer science myopic binary point view brought focus
Computing beginning recognize value interdisciplinary approach problem solving
However approach limited mundane mixture drawing finding modern science example human eye hand finger arm movement might inform robotics display design etc
In addition recent effort address preponderance male anglo computer scientist usually wealthy industrialized nation
Little attention given might learned ancient
This say effort deal pollution exclusion arrogance much done honoring likely incorporating ancient knowledge
As computer scientist I look forward come Ancestral Computing Sustainability I find answer simply detailed repetition original post
You say different question experience Pomona
That mean pursue question
You found greater interest question mathematics
My question
Allow suggest perspective
One imagine stayed mathematics successful
Wouldn sent strong message community succeed area told
It seems would done great deal good
So new question seem make sense reason leaving
Two way changing STEM
Are bringing changing demographic STEM something greater substance
Three returning first observation staying mathematics perhaps would found based Bourdieu term habitus might brought previously unseen resource mathematics might powerful effect practice mathematics
There feminist movement suggests woman science differently men parallel notion
I telling made bad choice wrong choice
I suggesting choice based new question matter access
There something mathematics interest enough stay
There way mathematics coincide think intellectually
This feeling lonely
It perhaps perceiving different way perceiving seem leverage mathematics
These speculative notion I hope see ostensible reason may hiding something significance
The last commentator alludes I suggesting
I want u become much realistic motif may driven hidden ideology aware
Donald I always curious pathway bring people place occupy moment
You speak one personal experience process ferreting hidden significance may driven hidden ideology
Might wiling share personal example endeavor
After spending time reflecting response I begin comment agreement last statement posed possible unknown motif researcher
Publishing one way engage process reflecting invisible knapsack carry potentially share work others may understand perspective
Unpacking bias Peggy McIntosh point work White privilege serve greater good research practice
And spirit pointing bias know Donald addressed process critically reflecting unaware motivation response extension work
I see conversation dialogue offer u opportunity explore positionalities work daily basis
About question issue raising root epistemological standpoint mathematics extension computer science
What I change STEM
I working towards epistemological shift STEM field particularly computer science
For example I influenced continue curriculum design high school student draw cultural knowledge approach learning including teacher development
But comment credential
Bourdieu also describes field power explicit component habitus promotes dialogical exposition power relation
I welcome meeting person discus topic
A reader let know share campus
Cueponcaxochitl Previous post focused motif previous choice related math field
As Critical Race Theory reminds u white folk lived experience structural interpersonal racism
Indeed benefit
For reason I position question motif instead try best understand alienation woman Mexican ancestry math class
I like refocus attention idea central blog post work
Your work unique considers cultural gender access issue computing also reframes nature computing mean grounding indigenous knowledge system
This approach potential revolutionize computer science field diversifying field two important way
Thank comment Mel
I finished teaching doctoral course decolonizing research method
I learned much
One student shared Huffington Post article u entitled Knowledge perspective Mayan Ixil People
It relevant aspect Ancestral Computing Sustainability highlight ancestral knowledge system considering epistemicide
Tobias Roberts share earth sustainable method Ixil people privilege university
Computing approach might situate production
Examples challenge faced Mayan Ixil people require intimate knowledge local context order produce complex solution challenge
Cueponcaxochitl say perhaps new blog post
experience underrepresented student using method
For example critic say using instrumental approach tell kid computing math worth time effort allow XYZ essentially telling kid math computing worthy interest
I ask question part I notice kid work occasionally pure math investigation cultural computing see example I absolutely idea predict even encourage
Thank work area sharing back story arrived desire study awareness integration ancestral knowledge might positively influence computer science education ultimately quality life planet
I share concern consumption latest technology lead toxic waste devastation country
If familiar work Annie Leonard may want check Thank question Ron
I thought respond day finally arrived You find longer version response book I writing three year study area
The medium version third piece I reference shortest version story Doing math Danny Martin suggests happen isolation
When math liberation underserved student connect meaningful participation
Your work Culturally Situated Design Tools CDST helped student make connection ancestral knowledge system computing briefly I would say barely touching surface
If time could explored example connecting ancestral knowledge system computing
For example could looked calculation time socially constructed differ across historical cultural practice
These social underpinnings construction time architectural design robotic design separated single act pure computing exist vacuum
Computing liberation give student reason initial familiarity grounded know best reach individual collective understanding
After making connection ancestral knowledge weaving computing visualizing data modeling design unit used CDSTs student continued connection unit particular data analysis unit one student created final presentation using programming storytelling deliver strong message community paraphrasing Why turn ancestral foodways medicinal practice
So computer science learning served create artifact delivered meaningful message inspiration
In tandem learning computer science classroom teacher student classroom school organization transformed abandoned lot high school campus create community garden The People Garden
Thank reading

Thank comment Lynn sharing The Story Stuff
Annie Leonard work reminds reading digesting class neoliberal policy affecting educational institution policy point consumerism multiple aspect
shoe AND school think movement privatize education corporate charter school
I also think society might looked waste management time
For example see Mexica people Tenochtitlan disposed excess waste chinampas instance
Of course context different today philosophical underpinnings still applicable
And I believe people like parent still hold sacred act practical us day recycling help pay family livelihood reason ancestral memory motivates
Our interdependence earth mother sky father old old relationship

Cueponcaxochitl thank presence online contribution ASU community East Los well
As aware I recently published first paper sustainability recycled material suburban context specifically old wood stone paint
Here link paper
Your ancestral computing driving force behind household building sustainability HBS model tool asks common take step back think compute best use building material otherwise would tossed dumpster
The paper I felt necessary write although based experience I know city suburban household currently faced challenge waste management
I belief matter sustainability must rooted household level
Here I wrote snap shot As thought tool sustainable development AC challenge u ask technology built computer made disposed Moreno Sandoval personal communication May
When AC work conjunction HBS reclaimed building material compete chance strengthen retrofit particular building task project
This relating measuring aspect sustainability household computing solving complex social problem Moreno Sandoval refers
Other I critique work
I practical person I reading paper Ancestral Computing I looking something I could pas student deconstruct help build HBS model
Best Santiago Thank comment Santiago
I glad see embodying Ancestral Computing sustainability home
This approach follows Zapatista model theorizing participating world starting build backyard literally figuratively
I look forward hearing student build work

Cueponcaxochitl trip threefold learn others two conference share research ancestral computing sustainability exchange land people star Good article
I certainly love website
Continue good work
I found following MCQ really helpfull CSE student

In context Computer Science use program black box mean use relation executing program chosen input without examining actual code representation sequence symbol program
Using program black box popular Computer Science understanding property program code notoriously hard problem
In talk I survey result regarding use program cryptography
Somewhat surprisingly turn case looking code program actually help
On positive side I present new cryptographic scheme zero knowledge proof system obtainable using technique
Such scheme previously proven obtainable using technique hence conjectured exist
I also briefly survey positive application technique
I also demonstrate power non black box technique negative result namely impossibility result task scrambling obfuscating software

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Testing important activity checking correctness system implementation
We need find bug system unit level well integration system level testing
At unit level use white box testing approach find bug developed code whereas integration system level use black box testing approach validate system functionality
In paper focus two widely used black box white box approach software testing
We compare various feature approach find approach useful different stage testing find bug software
Software testing important component software engineering field important technique improving software quality
There two main technique software testing white box testing black box testing
Black box testing deal functionality system based software requirement
Black box testing performed user perspective giving input data getting valid output
White box testing concerned inner design structure system
White box testing helpful find bug software initial level testing
A couple paper describe black box white box testing technique highlighting different feature technique
These paper also tell advantage disadvantage approach explained stage approach used
The paper also mentioned testing cost tester skill testing type
In paper look detail black box white box testing
We highlight main technique different feature approach
Based feature take comparison technique analyze technique feasible testing certain stage software testing
As white box testing used unit level black box testing used integration system level testing
So using white box black box testing sufficient find bug software
Both approach importance testing software finding bug different level software testing
This paper organized follows
Section paper describes black box testing method detail
Section includes detail white box testing approach used test software project
Section describes comparison testing approach white box black box testing
Section concludes paper
Black box testing treat system explicitly use Knowledge internal structure code
Therefore black box testing performed giving input getting expected output
Black box testing verifies correctness software behaviour referred behaviour coverage
The focus black box testing functionality system
Black box testing requirement includes software requirement us case executable program data
These requirement usually met middle phase development lifecycle large piece code begin operate together
Black box testing performed source code
As programming completes packaged larger component code
This package built compiling linking binding executable code demonstrate collective code execution behaviour input output
Here Black box testing diagram
Diagram Black box Testing Developers usually focus positive testing validating expected behaviour code
Tester add value black box testing executing positive negative testing tester know defect found unexpected behaviour
Here technique Black box testing
Equivalence class technique In technique software data divided partition data test case derived
This technique ensures test case derived cover partitioned data
According method one test case enough partition check behaviour program
By using equivalence class technique test case reduced test case partition find new fault program
The recommended black box approach selecting equivalence class value includes value beginning middle end data range
We understand technique help example
Let u assume security system validate log IDs production
Now tester validate logon IDs hand tester know three category IDs clerk supervisor manager
Now sample category sufficient validation
Let u consider logon IDs category
During validation logon IDs given category accepted increase sample size logon ID category continue testing
If initial sample IDs three category correctly accepted tester achieved desired test result using possible test data
Boundary Value Analysis technique In technique analysis extended beginning ending input value possibility equivalence class
The boundary value around beginning ending portion functional error input output data occurs around boundary
The boundary analysis begin identifying smallest value increment specific equivalence class
This increment smallest value called boundary value epsilon
It used calculate value around beginning ending value equivalence class
If take example boundary value category would value equivalence value
Equivalence class remain smaller even addition boundary test value
Expected result coverage Technique The expected result coverage technique focus output test value related input value
To get expected result need find business rule application requirement
The difference expected result actual result combination input cause analysis determine difference faulty test design unclear ambiguous rule program error
Error Guessing In technique Tester judge bug error hidden
Tester test application past experience creates test case validate different task
There specific tool used technique
Advantages Black Box testing Here advantage black box testing Ease Use Black Box testing involved inner functionality application easy tester create test case simple working application
Black box tester need high skill programming rather low skilled person black box testing
Quicker Test Case Development Test case developed quickly tester concern user interface
There need identify internal path may involves specific process
The tester cover UI path user may take make quicker test development
Simplicity Using black box testing even complex application tested focus valid invalid input ensuring correct put received
Issues Black box testing The Followings issue black box testing approach
Fragility User interface interaction make script fragile
The reason UI may rendered constantly time time different platform
Unless tool capable dealing difference UI rendering likely test case fail execute properly
Lack introspection One drawback black box testing look inner logic application unlike white box testing
Therefore black box testing never test application fully
Failure reason Another issue black box testing found reason failure
It tell cause failure system
So pure black box testing guarantee coverage tested component
The white box testing involves inner logic program test case constructed source code program
It based knowledge system implemented
White box testing includes analysis data flow control flow information flow coding practice exception error handling within system test intended unintended behaviour system
White box testing requires access source code
When code developed white box testing performed time life cycle good practice perform white box testing unit level testing
The first step white box testing analyze available design documentation source code knowing make software secure fundamental requirement
Second create test exploit software
Third thing perform testing effectively tester need know technique tool used white box testing
White box testing normally developer extension code debugging activity
The developer usually focus making code work give tendency debug code know work
Software tester add value developer debugging activity helping developer plan debug code usual
The logic test coverage attain debugging fewer defect discovered later kind testing
The earlier defect discovered le expensive correct
Research yet produced white box approach guarantee logic test coverage situation
Here diagram white box testing
Static Analysis Manual Automated Inspection Walkthrough Symbolic Execution Static Verification Diagram White Box Testing White box testing verifies correctness software statement code path condition loop data flow
The prerequisite white box testing include software requirement use case executable program data source code
Here technique used white box testing
Statement Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code line program executed
If line source code program determine manually tool executed line source code achieved statement coverage
A hypothesis context higher source code test coverage fewer defect found later
The practical conclusion new unexecuted code line software time bomb waiting explode inopportune moment production
The question explode question
Branch coverage technique This technique focus determining percentage source code branch logic program executed
Suppose source code branch point program determine manually tool executed branch counting true false branch execution separately achieved branch point coverage
The unexecuted branch unexecuted statement found often untested error recovery logic
Testing simple condition branch compound condition branch requires fewer initial test action
The developer need choose test value force true branch test value force false branch two test value per branch
Compound Condition Coverage Technique This technique extends branch coverage technique branch compound condition one contain combination Boolean operator AND OR NOT along pair parenthesis possible nested
In technique challenge identify test value combination evaluate true false every simple condition every Boolean combination simple condition
Path Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code path program traversed completely
A source code path sequence program statement first executable statement series arithmetic replacement branch looping statement statement
If different path program determine manually tool executed achieved path coverage
The underlying hypothesis higher path test coverage fewer defect found later
Loop Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code loop program cycled completely
In programming language several loop like DO FOR WHILE UNTIL
Some loop clever construct IF statement subsequent return IF statement
The objective loop testing force program loop zero time one time time n terminal loop value n time time
The loop loop loop validate expected loop response beginning middle end longest loop
The time loop test unexpected inappropriate looping condition
Here list common advantage white box testing
Introspection Introspection ability look inside application tester identify object programmatically
It helpful UI change frequently UI yet known It allows testing proceed
In situation decrease fragility test script provided name object change
Stability White box testing delivers greater stability reusability test case object include application never change
Thoroughness White box testing helpful technique essential know every path thoroughly tested every possible internal interaction examined
This technique give tester ability thorough term much application test
The issue white box testing listed Complexity The tester must detailed programmatic knowledge application order test white box testing technique
White box testing involves internal logic application code complexity requires highly skilled tester develop test case
Fragility Although introspection overcomes issue application change breaking test script reality often name object change product development
White box testing requires test script tightly tied underlying code application mean change code often cause white box test script break
Then introduces high degree script maintenance testing process
Integration Due highly integrated nature white box testing tool many provide support one platform usually window
In company company application run platform either need use different tool need test manually
Black box testing based requirement therefore also called behavioral functional testing technique whereas white box testing based internal logic structure project therefore also called structural testing
Black box testing creates test data without aspect software structure technique consider test object implemented requirement
On hand white box testing test derived structure tested object test based actual implementation
Black box testing methodology used integration level system level need look source code need execute system using input data output result
On hand white box testing used logical analytic test unit test level
Black box tester le technical programming bond code tester perception simple white box tester need programming skill identify test path software
In black box testing test case designed soon functional specification complete whereas white box testing test designed program code developed
Black box tester used verify contradiction actual system specification whereas white box tester chooses test case input exercise path code determines appropriate output
It reveals error hidden code
Black box testing focus result user experience whereas white box testing focus internal working making sure application work efficiently possible
White box testing time consuming especially applied whole system directly identifies bug software
In black box testing input need large sample space find expected result
There bug found using black box white box testing
In black box difficult identify possible input limited testing time writing test case slow difficult
In white box testing possible test every path loop program exhaustive testing impossible large system
In black box testing code may reachable without extraordinary measure whereas white box testing tell functionality implemented program
The comprehensive test coverage may achieved black box white box testing technique combined methodology include various benefit application testing
As discussed Black box testing validates functionality software ensures system working correctly according user requirement
Black box testing le expensive compare white box testing performed le technical individual Black box approach cover comprehensive testing system
On hand White box testing check internal structure inner loop condition logic code verify working code
White box testing expensive performed skilled technical individual software size getting huge difficult check part source code integration system level testing
As testing method pro con applied certain level testing
So using one testing approach guarantee bug free software
In conclusion say comprehensive testing system may achieved using technique software testing
White box testing used black box testing improve overall test effectiveness

Researchers reconstructed long string genetic code believe common ancestor placental mammal shrewlike creature lived Asia million year ago
The leader research team David Haussler University California Santa Cruz admits concept may sound like plot line Jurassic Park sequel
But say real point research learn evolutionary path different specie diverged time make easier decipher genetic code
It driven curiosity origin Haussler told Tuesday
If really want understand detail molecular level evolution work reconstruct evolutionary history every base genome
It see key event
The supposed ancestor long gone course scientist plan bring back life
Rather experiment served exercise paleogenomics application genetics scientific question ancient past
To come ancestral genetic code scientist looked closely studied region mammalian genome known CFTR locus
That region linked incidence cystic fibrosis medical researcher spent lot time compiling code human many animal well
The code string consists million base pair letter read like GTCACAATT
A sophisticated computer program compared equivalent string human placental mammal mammal carry young birth within placenta opposed pouch
The scientist concluded result reflected code common ancestor accuracy percent based repeated simulation comparison genetic code animal outside original group chicken opossum
Just looking reconstructed code could tell whether common ancestor mouse armadillo
However pointed animal known Eomaia scansoria one earliest placental mammal
Haussler said genetic code generated team probably described similar recent creature existed million year ago dinosaur walked earth
Haussler said team confident accuracy result part mammalian branch spread quickly root evolutionary family tree
You rapid radiation different lineage fanned like starburst explained
It like ancient text different copy text stored away different place one underwent independent separate type decay process
You better chance reconstructing actual ancient text different change different copy independent
Ironically technique work nearly well find common ancestral code cat dog relatively close evolutionary tree
Haussler Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator joined research Mathieu Blanchette McGill University
Eric Green National Human Genome Research Institute Webb Miller Penn State University
Their finding published December issue journal Genome Research
Cornell University geneticist Rasmus Nielsen said newly published study would likely spark work field
Previously thought would never really know ancestor looked like genetic level appears able tell said
Haussler said much genetic data would required focus full ancestral genome
Although million base pair CFTR locus sound like huge number full genome amount whopping billion base pair
Nevertheless Haussler belief technique colleague used could someday produce new insight evolutionary history
It possible evolutionary change studied laboratory see effect gene said
For example suggested particularly intriguing portion ancestral DNA could synthesized inserted mouse gene testing
Such experiment could turn yield new medical advance
We even scratched surface term understanding change actually occurred molecular level evolution said

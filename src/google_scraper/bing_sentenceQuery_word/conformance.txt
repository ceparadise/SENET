Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I curious difference meaning connotation style correctness using conformity v conformance
I able find much using simple web search single source suggests proper English form
I primarily interested American English information dialect welcome
According NOAD noun mean The source go state another term
So basically
The change law
The change law
However trawling Wikipedia reveals difference two come usage
Here say well something product animal meet specified standard may also refer act matching attitude belief behavior group norm
Norms implicit rule shared group individual guide interaction others among society social group
This tendency conform occurs small group society whole may result subtle unconscious influence direct overt social pressure
Conformity occur presence others individual alone
For example people tend follow social norm eating watching television even alone
conforming social norm
conforming technical specification
Boring people characterized conformity championship dog closely match breed requirement noted conformance
According international standard ISO term defined
The term synonymous deprecated
By posting answer agree

Certificates conformance document certifying supplied good service meet specification legal specification required
They also called certificate compliance certificate conformity
The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission provides sample General Certificate Conformity GCC website show necessary format content
The first required element detailed identification product
The next element citation safety regulation product certified
The name full mailing address telephone number manufacturer importer must provided along full contact information including email address individual maintains test result support certification
The date place product manufactured come next
If manufacturer multiple location address specific location product produced included
The final element identification laboratory provided certification
This field required product certified intended use around child
Some manufacturer may volunteer product designed child also tested laboratory
If choose laboratory contact information must included

January With standard specification project eventually discussion turn know application conforms standard specification
Thus begin discussion conformance testing
Although type testing done long time still usually confusion involved
There many type testing including testing performance robustness behavior function interoperability
Conformance testing may include kind test one fundamental difference
Conformance testing testing see implementation meet requirement standard specification
The requirement criterion conformance must specified standard specification usually conformance clause conformance statement
Some standard subsequent standard test methodology assertion tested
If criterion requirement conformance specified conformance testing
The general definition conformance changed time refined specific standard
In DIS defined conformance testing test evaluate adherence nonadherence candidate implementation standard
TR defined conformance conformity fulfillment product process service relevant specified conformance requirement
In recent year term conformity gained international use generally replaced term conformance ISO document
In Guide defined three major term used field
conformity fulfillment product process service specified requirement
conformity assessment activity concerned determining directly indirectly relevant requirement fulfilled
conformity testing conformity evaluation mean testing
Guide also mention Typical example conformity assessment activity sampling testing inspection evaluation verification assurance conformity supplier declaration certification registration accreditation approval well combination
Conformity assessment meant provide user conforming product assurance confidence product behaves expected performs function known manner interface format known
Conformity assessment NOT way judge one product better another
Conformity assessment neutral mechanism judge product criterion standard specification
Not standard specification conformity assessment program testing program
Usually assessment program limited standard specification critical application run correctly interoperability application security system
The decision establish program based risk nonconformance versus cost creating running program
A conformity assessment program usually requires The first two requirement conformity assessment program standard specification something defines conformance
If conformance clause test method standard definition conformance standard specification
The next requirement mechanism testing test suite testing tool
Development test suite testing tool costliest part conformity assessment program
The cost dependent type testing required see
The two requirement conformity assessment program procedure testing someone testing following specified procedure
The quality test suite testing tool detail procedure expertise tester determine quality reliability repeatability test result
The procedure detailed enough ensure repeated change test result
They documentation testing done direction tester follow
These procedure also contain information must done failure occur
Most testing program strive obtain impartial objective result
remove subjectivity much possible procedure testing tool
A standard specification may require one type testing
However type testing required significant impact cost testing
To illustrate IEEE Std defines three type testing Exhaustive testing seek verify behavior every aspect element including permutation
For example exhaustive testing given user command would require testing command option option pair option every permutation option
Exhaustive testing developing test requirement standard specification take many staff year prohibitively expensive
In case impossible test possible test case reasonable amount time
As example approximately unique error condition
The occurrence one error often affect proper detection another error
An exhaustive test error would require one test per error one test per possible permutation error
Thus instead test billion test would needed power
Even simple example thirteen field page three possible input per field number possible test case
Thus number test case specification grow exponentially quickly
Thorough testing seek verify behavior every aspect element include permutation
For example perform thorough testing given command command shall tested option option individually
Possible combination option may also tested
Usually test method conformance clause may specify boundary used thorough testing suggest range possibility could tested
Identification testing seek verify distinguishing characteristic element question
It consists cursory examination element invoking minimal command syntax verifying minimal function
An example might simply determine value field field exists opposed testing acceptable value
For testing program successful must meet specific goal conformity assessment program
Usually conformity assessment program must efficient effective repeatable
To minimize cost burden participant program must efficient
Test tool must optimized maximize automation minimize human intervention
Critical area need identified testing
Other area critical require testing also need identified
It expensive test everything
Testing procedure procedure processing test result need automated possible
The testing program must effective
It must test critical area required specification standard meet requirement
It must provide desired level assurance customer base
To meet international guideline test result must repeatable reproducible
Repeatable result mean different tester following procedure test methodology able get result platform
Some testing program require reproducibility different tester following procedure test methodology able repeat result different platform

Conformance testing assessment product compliance standard
Different kind conformance testing help ass compliance wide variety standard many different industry organization agency
Conformance testing serf establish whether product complies applicable standard allowing manufacturer advertise ensuring product consistency
Within general definition different kind conformance testing
One electrical product tester might look handling electromagnetic wave protection power spike kind functionality safety meet particular standard
Another kind conformance testing software need produce result comply industry standard
Groups like International Standards Organization ISO defined conformance testing certain extent
Other industry group like Institute Electrical Electronics Engineers IEEE weighed particular objective conformance testing respective field
Conformance testing generally establishes certain quality standard product
Some aspect kind testing could investigate qualification supplier
Conformance testing may also test different configuration product compliance standard

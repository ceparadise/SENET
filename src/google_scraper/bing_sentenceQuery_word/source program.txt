When Programmers try find solution problem convert series step called Algorithm
This algorithm conveyed Operating system running machine
Operating system provide series simple instruction understand
These small instruction
So small expressing abstract idea like cover picture Facebook set impossible express language barebones instruction set
So concept high level programming language look comprehensible know basic programming
Even programming background seem alien This written plain english much easier reason
There complex tool called compiler interpreter translate like smaller instruction Operating System understands execute
However instruction remains language higher level algorithm expressed
call Still question
Ask

Source code list instruction programmer word processing developing program
The source code run turn machine code also called object code computer understand execute
Object code consists primarily
Source code object code state computer program compiled
Programming language compile code include C Delphi Swift Fortran Haskell Pascal many others
Here example C language source code You computer programmer tell code something printing Hello World
Of course source code much complex example
It unusual software program million line code
Windows operating system reported million line code
Source code either proprietary open
Many company closely guard source code
Users use compiled code see modify
Microsoft Office example proprietary source code
Other company post code internet free anyone download
Apache OpenOffice example open source software code
Some programming language JavaScript compiled machine code instead
In case distinction source code object code apply one code
That single code source code read copied
In case developer code may intentionally encrypt prevent viewing
Programming language interpreted include Python Java Ruby Perl PHP Postscript VBScript many others
There error

We discus open source software basic behind Open Source Initiative OSI Free Software Licensing
refers program software form program programmer writes program particular programming language available general public use modification original design free charge
Open source code typically created collaborative effort programmer improve upon code share change within community
The rationale movement larger group concerned proprietary ownership financial gain produce useful product everyone use
The concept relies peer review find eliminate program code process commercially developed packaged employ
The basic behind Open Source Initiative programmer read redistribute modify source code piece software evolves
Open source sprouted technological community response proprietary software owned corporation
Proprietary software privately owned controlled
In computer industry proprietary considered opposite open
A proprietary design technique one owned company
It also implies company divulged specification would allow company duplicate product
Open Source certification standard issued OSI indicates source code computer program made available free charge general public
OSI dictate order considered OSI Certified product must meet following criterion Open source software normally distributed source code open source license
The Open Source Initiative set following distribution term software must comply Open source mean access source code
The distribution term software must comply following criterion The license shall restrict party selling giving away software component aggregate software distribution containing program several different source
The license shall require royalty fee sale
The program must include source code must allow distribution source code well compiled form
Where form product distributed source code must mean obtaining source code reasonable reproduction cost preferably downloading via Internet without charge
The source code must preferred form programmer would modify program
Deliberately obfuscated source code allowed
Intermediate form output preprocessor translator allowed The license must allow modification derived work must allow distributed term license original software
The license may restrict distributed modified form license allows distribution patch file source code purpose modifying program build time
The license must explicitly permit distribution software built modified source code
The license may require derived work carry different name version number original software
The license must discriminate person group person
The license must restrict anyone making use program specific field endeavor
For example may restrict program used business used genetic research
The right attached program must apply program redistributed without need execution additional license party
The right attached program must depend program part particular software distribution
If program extracted distribution used distributed within term program license party program redistributed right granted conjunction original software distribution
The license must place restriction software distributed along licensed software
For example license must insist program distributed medium must software
No provision license may predicated individual technology style interface
All open source software distributed licensing agreement
Some may use free software license copyleft GPL compatible
The GNU GPL license free software license copyleft license GNU Lesser General Public License free software license strong copyleft license
There many different type license free software
GNU GPL compatible
The Open Source Initiative approves open source license successfully gone approval process comply Open Source Definition
There currently well fifty license approved OSI
For example GNU General Public License GPL one license accompanies open source software detail software accompany source code freely copied distributed modified
The widespread use GPL reference GNU GPL commonly abbreviated simply GPL understood term refers GNU GPL
One basic tenet GPL anyone acquires material must make available anyone else licensing agreement
The GPL cover activity copying distributing modifying source code
Other open source license include following A software programmer really reason contributing open source project
Some may looking fun challenge others looking improve skill build programming ability may want belong group project
In many instance opportunity make money open source project funded government corporate sponsor
Unlike commercial project open source project allow programmer name known benefit programmer name portfolio lead future job funded open source commercial project
The hype benefit open source gone unnoticed commercial world corporation jumped open source bandwagon
Since commercial software sold profit one may wonder company would interested open source project
In many case company able profit selling tool module paid consulting service technical support program
Sendmail open source mail transfer agent MTA used routing delivery

submitted Hey inspired I decided undergraduate Computer Science degree
I compiled mostly MOOCs Udacity course markdown file find Github It replicates structure Computer Science track university focus core CS course
Being I love get pull request improvement addition make better everyone
I hope help anyone want learn Computer Science
Post comment
Its good collection missing say core c course Udacity cover Atomata theory give intro compiler well really wrap two core topic course develop web browser python
For branched exploring vast array topic encompass automaton theory
Coursera nice automaton course Jeffrey Ullman Jeffrey Ullman
Compiler design elective core imo Compiler yeah pre compiler eye opener
Just writing simple lexer parser gave insight I Automata theory programming language theory usually teach stuff
Depends go class mandatory
No
Definitely
Compilers super important
The number problem want solve reduce principle learn compiler course staggering
Pretty much everything dealing book keeping resource management compiler squint
Pretty much everything dealing book keeping resource management compiler squint
What
Compilers super important
The number problem want solve reduce principle learn compiler course staggering
Compilers important I think learning compiler design core requirement CS education
Compiler design great applies ton knowledge learned core class
You able see foundation built class used create something complex compiler
Somewhere great article I remember I wrote I find
In place I offer following
See slide super high level qualitative reason Stanford think compiler study essential want mature developer
Beyond think step one go compiling
You must understand parse incoming data build data structure make data easy efficient work transform useful way difficult constraint preserving meaning output potentially wildly different format
It huge swath software expected behave
However unlike problem work compiler huge body literature decade continuous academic industrial research behind design
The technique used implement efficiently maintainable way well explored valuable
It like studying aerospace engineering course airfoil fixed wing
Since open source perhaps could contribute know resource Yes replied another comment Do know good online version class
Automata theory Compiler design programming lang theory excellent professor find need view video online
also heavy course load find time either Why core CS course
At fundamental level CS understanding talk computer understanding work
IMHO I think course helpful able solve problem
Automata theory study abstract idea machine model capable solving much time
IMO le two kind model use today program computer
This study abstract solving problem machine
Practice may solving programming finite state machine useful many practical application
Programming language theory deal abstract strength weakness particular programming language
Part class might spent practicing functional programming language example
Compilers
IMO better knowledge compiler use every day
All add better solving problem knowing programming language provide provide
I totally get
My point many top institution even require class
If school already programmer really need learn topic
The issue increase unknown unknown
If get problem use finite state machine solve unlikely randomly guess look finite state machine
This learning problematic long run
I EE trying teach CS stuff little I constantly running problem
Something I think would help people like broad course basically survey field rather delving topic
That way I could get understanding topic knowledge exist field necessary competent computer scientist could dive topic pace I need solving problem
There varying opinion Udacity program lot people recently got grumpy I Intro Programming course deleted old forum useful information within I definitely vouch purpose
I thought course well deliberately brushing many topic without delving deep
Starts path knowing know pretty well
Disclaimer I gotten finish yet
I cancel subscription week due taking much
I plan restart save progress though
I finished course
Also really beginner may useful depending current knowledge base
Which Udacity course talking
They various paid track program
I worked Intro Programming one
There plenty programmer barely know anything CS
And people CS degree Raises hand
I afraid admit I barely know computer science
I still learning
I mean built upon like century worth mathematics
It easy know non trivial amount subject
Yep I went college Canada quite sure equivalent US
become programmer mostly practical course I get theory course
I looking right spare time I enjoy want better
My laziness get better though
I managed get beyond first chapter every programmer ought know memory book
Well spent Data Structures learning Dijkstra Algorithm BST I work hash
Ca expect keep bullshit RAM quick access
Jesus good job
I wait go home hash It depends
Do need skill right job
Then learn relevant topic
Do want become great software engineer make career evolve
Then sooner later stumble problem need understand graph theory CPU cache design whatever
These problem easier solve already strong foundation otherwise overwhelmed thing catch
This programming MOOC
It want emulate degree
As important reply comment answer As someone know extremely little programming code academy course something I dive right anything I cover beginning
I looking broaden knowledge starting bachelor computer science year two
You dive
The first term lesson Intro Computer Science really meant little programming knowledge
So good Wait
So high school right
If follow course
Just intro programming start building thing put github start competitive programming stick like
Get good grade apply top CS school
If good programming project significative competitve programming record could get top school
You time learn thing online course importantly good professor student emulate
I high school year getting back college computer science
Do course HarvardX
The lecture actually entertaining watch unlike moocs problem set challenging
If finish excellent base knowledge choose course see fit
What missing standard US university CS degree collection math requirement kind elective science requirement
This includes level interest
semester two semester depending flexible university math reqs Also fun mandatory UX Design Mobile Dev Database system Intro web dev optional course one might take leading track graduation
At university one might take course following field seem interesting setting track graduation Then sort fun thing take might help field Came say
Computer programming
I trello compiled becoming full stack JavaScript developer
I would love share
I CS student university right although course great actually learn develop JavaScript pretty easy language
Much easier C opinion
For full stack JavaScript development I suggest check I
However much attempt offer everything
I actually want hear I cover gap
Sure I share trello board send email
Got thanks
Is meant used starting far left column cover everything I familiar
Yeah I conversation one founder freecode camp said left right order learn full stack
Got thanks
By way I think board public added member edit
It also missing command line part covered git section
Since work progress board I like way trello treating people edit stuff
Please elaborate
Well even brilliant people working hard improving freecodecamp list supplemental study
I sorry technology way learn never googling never using multiple resource
Interested far
I year left degree
And I halfway bonfire
Cool
I starting ziplines
Def
Still learning feel like I getting relatively complete package Can define stack
I computer related degree still understand
deleted I thought P LAMP PHP I thought PERL P Python begin P
The final P LAMPP PHP I believe
So PHP alternative
know Please capitalize Perl
Oops unintentional I old COBOL fossil old habit die hard
Thanks
This comment really helped lay concisely
A stack layer technology used make application
So web development gon na system administration way development everything
Oh make sense
So stack relative one talking
A al osi staxk stack DS stack web application
The way described closely aligns I see term applied industry Vancouver Tech case local interpretation term
Frontend development part stack Backend development
To full stack developer comfortable working anywhere within application stack
Some popular stack stack one
I often see Ops get bundled term though
But maybe whole DevOps movement see change new term emerge merges everything Developer role
Interestingly I usually see term used outside Web Development
Things tend specific Console Development Embedded Systems Mobile App Development etc
Does anyone experience inconsistent
I curious
No I believe correct full stack dev would generally apply web development form software engineering
The stack set hardware software technology comprise everything needed serve website browser
Full stack mean front end tech html CSS JavaScript framework built well back end tech web server database underlying logic
For full stack JavaScript apps JavaScript language used front end styling communication well back end logic used communicate database web server
Thank
Could share
I interested seeing
Trello weird I need email address share board
JavaScript easier C way I feel like understanding thing make C difficult also important part solid CS education
At school I introduced programming C I fully understand certain concept I started learning JavaScript
Could share u
PM email address
This crazy I searching free online computer science degree curriculum today
This spurred interest taking course I start thinking I go
In search I found follow article
I also found article couple year ago
This site course broken different topic real curriculum per se
Thanks putting together I hope embark The Computer Science Degree month I finish course
It worth adding missing course even elective category
In CS degree number CS elective also required along core course
I would add track followed UC Berkeley
Year long sequence intro CS covering several language dedicated Discrete Structures course
All offered free iTunes U updated every term I believe
This look great
Really like link youtube playlist pain downloading coursera
Thanks
Maybe could even basis expanded curriculum special tract minor
Um even look class putting list
MIT graduate level class
This curriculum make sense
So something would follow Uni course rather part
Correct
If graduate level course mean one entered Masters PhD program generally speaking
Sometimes undergraduate version course sometimes undergrad grad course taught classroom
deleted In University course usually level course
Undergraduates never allowed level course
So many year supposed represent
Terms make think one year though maybe US call year term something I sure
deleted Right cool would cool get clarification nice idea though The beauty format one learn pace
So goal finish program year term month year term would month etc
It individual learner
The curriculum based typical year university program term would year student would taking kind general education elective course along
Right cool saying course inappropriate grad level rather uni
In case I could find MIT grad level course particular subject
Thanks support community suggestion alternative easier already added project
As aside I also would scared graduate level course
Just part graduate program mean incredibly difficult could provide nice challenge even student considers undergraduate
OP mentioned core class
Depending major year right
The rest would requirement elective class one minor project thesis required etc
Several course linked seem
MIT Data Structures MIT Computer Architecture seem problem
I check others
This look like software engineering programming curriculum
Computer Science requires much much math total credit pure math along course theoretical computer science
Exactly
The real problem people seem make proper distinction programming computer science
You see time people ask question like I really need know math theory class
I never needed programming job
If want go build next greatest checkbook balancing business app great go programmer
If want advance state art machine learning computer vision study computer science ask requisite math theory curse
But people need understand quite different
There course listing data structure algorithm term advance data structure
I remember coming across link someone compiling list resource felt equivalent CS degree
For whatever worth What I really like see rating understand various course
There hundred free paid course covering topic I limited time would good know looking useful one
People mentioning level shop checked level course put appropriate order jumble different online course
Took brief look thanks
How many course based around c
popular curriculum list compare offer comprehensive must know course later life looking get entrenched CS
Harvard mostly C Very nice
Thank much sharing
This awesome thank
Nice list
Do know wanted keep focused purely CS side math could hurt right

Calculus Linear Algebra
Thanks awesome thanks
Nice
Commenting save Nice
What introduction course
Its pretty well done taking along
may bit harder though Magnificent
Thanks taking time
Splendid
This seems exactly sort thing I looking
It structured break I know
I graduated college liberal art degree political science I always passion technology
I advanced like people I build computer nothing fancy I know many people build computer
I hoping maybe help better understanding programming I possibly land job future without CS degree
I sorry I truly understand put Harvard Stanford
Have tried course
I finished I believe must everyone get started
How separating
turn give interesting insight topic structure digital image sound nowhere broad useful future programmer
Ca tell anything MOOCs section though
All course video based course No love user Maybe another file hold book resource course would really nice thanks list brother
Will working forseeable future
Did look article putting together
Seems like great idea
I think excellent idea
Will check I get home work
I leave comment I check desktop later
Sounds great

Source code sometimes referred version computer program
For noncompiled program language term source code object code apply since one form code
Programmers use visual programming tool create source code
In large program development environment often management system help programmer separate keep track different state level source code file
Source code licensing agreement often reflect distinction
When user installs software suite like example source code proprietary Microsoft give customer access software compiled executables associated library file various executable file require call program function
By comparison user installs open source software code downloaded modified
Typically proprietary software vendor like Microsoft share source code customer two reason protect prevent customer making change source code way might break program make vulnerable attack
Proprietary software license often prohibit attempt discover modify source code
Open source software hand purposely designed idea source code made available many developer working enhance software presumably help make robust secure
Users freely take open source code public license
Beyond providing foundation software creation source code important purpose well
For example skilled user access source code easily customize software installation needed
Meanwhile developer use source code create similar program operating platform task would trickier without coding instruction
Access source code also allows programmer contribute community either sharing code learning purpose recycling portion application
Many different program exist create source code
Here example source code Hello World program C language Hello World program include main printf Hello World Even person background programming read C programming source code understand goal program print word Hello World
In order carry however source code must first translated understand job special interpreter program called compiler case C compiler
After programmer compile source code file contains resulting output referred object code
Object code consists mainly number one zero easily read understood human
Object code linked create run perform specific program function
Source code management system help programmer better collaborate source code development example preventing one coder inadvertently overwriting work another
Determining historical start source code subjective elusive exercise
The first software written code depending one viewpoint program may initial sample source code
One earliest example source code recognize today written Tom Kilburn early pioneer computer science
Kilburn created first successful digital program held electronically computer memory software solved mathematical equation
In source code often provided free software company created program
As growing computer company expanded software use source code became prolific sought
Computing magazine prior internet age would often print source code page reader needing retype code character character use
Later decreased price electronically sharing source code internet deleted obstacle

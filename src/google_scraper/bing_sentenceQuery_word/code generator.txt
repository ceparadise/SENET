In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

In process convert form readily executed machine
Sophisticated compiler typically perform multiple pass various intermediate form
This process used many easier apply one time input one optimization relies completed processing performed another optimization
This organization also facilitates creation single compiler target multiple architecture last code generation stage need change target target
For information compiler design see
The input code generator typically consists
The tree converted linear sequence instruction usually
Further stage compilation may may referred code generation depending whether involve significant change representation program
For example pas would likely called code generation although code generator might incorporate peephole optimization pas
In addition basic conversion intermediate representation linear sequence machine instruction typical code generator try optimize generated code way
Tasks typically part sophisticated compiler code generation phase include Instruction selection typically carried abstract syntax tree matching particular tree configuration template example tree might transformed linear sequence instruction recursively generating sequence emitting instruction
In compiler us intermediate language may two instruction selection stage one convert parse tree intermediate code second phase much later convert intermediate code instruction target machine
This second phase require tree traversal done linearly typically involves simple replacement operation corresponding
However compiler actually example one convert second phase may involve tree linear intermediate code
When code generation occurs JIT important entire process respect space time
For example interpreted used generate code runtime often generated instead deterministic one usually former created quickly occupies le memory space latter
Despite generally generating le efficient code JIT code generation take advantage information available runtime
The fundamental task taking input one language producing output different language understood term core operation
Consequently technique originally developed use compiler come employed way well
For example Yet Another take input convert parser
Though originally created automatic generation parser compiler yacc also often used automate writing code need modified time specification changed
Many IDEs support form automatic often using algorithm common compiler code generator although commonly le complicated

submitted I year old quitting job next year go back school full time
When I younger I started college intention going computer science
I ended joining military getting water treatment
I got took job mill make toilet paper paper towel Costco
I drive forklift give plenty time research thing iPhone
It reason I tolerate job really
Anyway I gotten debt I free ride school GI Bill
I planning going Oregon State University
I confident I learn material concerned age
I around year old I graduate
I unique position I could take work little concern given pay
I mean I got eat I debt
I used go kid computer question I still degree long time
It definitely area I interested I concerned I old
Post comment
You definitely old
I graduating semester
The student CS school range year old
If mean desire get degree computer science let age hold back
Thanks If passionate enough age matter
What need thirst knowledge
You need programming
We ca denial employer want young cheap people
However driven wo stop getting job love
Do fret
Do want
You never old
I classmate ranging teen late CS program
I graduated age CS degree
Had internship last year got hired full time company right school
After year I got better job making
I would worry school I would worry employer looking age
The best advice I could give would put code github
Maybe every assignment could though certainly every larger project work
A portfolio code modern developer resume
And lead better job
You probably rather work company looking hire developer weeding resume
More advice If want write code living learn thing developer taught program
My experience CS mostly training theoretical computer scientist go figure training people want write software people use
I never used sort source control
I never sort testing TDD otherwise
Nothing UX
I design pattern class went basic GoF pattern without seeing real world example useless well anyways I need see pattern actually used real world understand benefit
Continuous integration
But first thing first get back school
Thank advice
I appreciate lot
To sum every thread like Some care wo
You feel silly old going back school like nontraditional student find people treat everyone else
Compared coder age fresh knowledge time industry
It trade losing one u unless comparing stagnant individual want would let stop
You likely still going come something love making money would otherwise
No life monolithic dedication single got breadth experience make seem wise adventured
Thanks reply
I appreciate
I guess little weird
Like I returning different part life
Could please elaborate mean losing trade
I mean fresh knowledge worth lot le experience field unless stagnant individual
However still different company need recruiter scour new graduate
age probably least concern
start relearning math That part reason I waiting another year
I planning taking math local community college next year
That way I reasonable foundation I get hard stuff
Also friend mine graduated OSU degree mathematics
She high school teacher actually said looking forward tough class since get teach anything past algebra
She math weirdo
LOL Congratulations decision take challenge
I started back CS degree last year early
I programming forever always feared math
Twice original college stint I tried taking calculus ended dropping lost day one
Once I decided go back I spent week going really elementary stuff
I felt silly adult review thing like fraction exponent I
The first college class I took time around refresher algebra course semester
This past spring first time ever I first semester Calculus
The personal satisfaction alone worth price admission
Math becomes amazingly interesting reason apply
I flunked calculus degree
Recently I picked machine learning amazing motivation get properly learn math actually reason apply
I year university comp sci I took Algebra I Calc community college well gen ed I start school year high school
I definitely recommend
The pacing math class slow enough get good
Also start afraid making friend people much younger
I couple friend much older interesting people I ever met give amazing life advice
ppl excel computer math weirdo deleted Ideally would true
fyi gig dont really care interest computer science think many would prefer interest x technology x architecture etc would like know know stuff computer science generally get c degree deleted reiterating misconception computer science theory hiring manager care fact oblivious computer science interested often entail working knowledge technology
older student still teach thing outside class room prior going time student getting current various technology like web service ui db etc
I late going back school working CS degree I work full time
We must stay determined focused ignore hater doubter
Old Dudes Unite
Woot
yeah im starting CS degree

nike
You fine
You surprised many older people even family back home
Your classmate OSU wo care age
Most employer wo either
The limitation
Not old
Even Silicon Valley programmer
OSU good school
If desire
Fuck age fuck anyone think age matter one iota
Some best programmer I know writing code kiddy playing shiny toy
Pay mind want
Thank frank advice
I see bos
make easier get hired DoD contractor
The reply post exactly I needed hear
I starting school week working towards CS degree
My age make doubt I would able
To see people older trying encouraging
It never late unless going die finishing learning unlikely since even old
What planning CS degree
Depending would like afterwards might necessarily need go university obtain CS degree
I want go OSU kind dream mine
Plus free GI Bill
Fair enough
I going say depending wanted would change answer
If want web development I would suggest something like college diploma would get school workforce faster
If wanted continue academia eye set one big tech company fb google amazon etc folk usually look people CS degree test data structure algorithm extensively interview say ca learn
Of course older people large number university still quiet
In last year I people course year old undergrad study
Hopefully go forward good luck
I start senior year Computer Science
In time I seen people range
I younger peer
Awesome
Thank
If footing bill absolutely nothing lose
Good luck
I CS major Oregon State I also
I gone back school GI Bill I entering junior year program fall
Are
Since I old either
You definitely want look internship program provides great opportunity get experience look good resume get foot door local company
Remember summer school friend
Also take class guy What strange coincidence
LOL
Thanks head
Maybe I run OSU couple year
What type software used water treatment industry
Which company key player water treatment software
I sure score job one company
Your domain knowledge make ideal candidate one company
Even IT department local water treatment facility
The plant I worked used specific system
Scada I think called
Anyway pretty straight forward signal coming valve needed open closed
It old
I sure newer treatment plant light year newer advanced
I read anything title
You never old anything
You fine sitting as nothing entire time
It sound like good time go back school
Congratulations career switch going great
What want degree
Are looking write software work IT support product manager manager
What size company interest
edit I ask tech executive manages bunch folk older quite familiar age bias tech workplace
I want solve problem I think I want deal IT support
I guess I thinking I narrow exactly I want I get closer completing degree
I like design thing
Do writing code yet write code yet know sure
In event couple thing need know reality software engineer career field likely though necessarily begin You going fighting uphill battle given age late getting marketplace
This industry heavily populated folk late teen twenty early
Some orgs care others
If intend remain software engineer fine vocation sure need relearn know every year
I done time far midst another round
Failure imperils ability continue earning money tougher baseline since year closing
That said absolutely reason ca as kicking software engineer understand need make real serious commitment stay current
This part folk like code typically better curious using exploring new tech
There choice besides purely writing code
Product management right company great blend business technical QA another role
DevOps role may also interesting
And course cross dark side like go management
Some folk tell matter fundamental language know framework experience learned fly
That may academically true reality getting paying job
If know framework team us going least one strike
I long time various role I soft spot nontraditional folk like I happy answer question may helpful
Im starting school first time fall im two kid
Will challenge oh yeah
Will worth undoubtedly
Math motivation You keep pushing
You keep pushing
I made every mistake could made
But I kept pushing
I think youll surprised far discipline alone take college thats something older student usually advantage
I hope right
Good job heading back school
definitely old
However said going back school full time next year starting
And expect complete
How come undergraduate education US take year
Elsewhere world usually year
Mature student make best student go
Edit aah
Scrolled saw post going math first communit college next year
I sure necessary
I think able catch math need discrete math linear algebra probability stats degree
Not encourage ton people graduate CS degree promptly forget math learned typical employment setting
For people
Another part I debt
I want spend next year saving money catching
I got thing I like finish well
I got shop finish building
I like complete turbo build silverado
Etc
actually estimate
Once I start I probably wo stop
Meaning I go summer
So yes likely take year
I around
One strange coincidence I graduate college year son graduate high school
I hoping college motivation motivate towards good grade high school
old give even try
I ca give
I started yet

Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

If talk like work like talk I would record document personal lawsuit
You guy talk like think guy field
That sort tell job make delusional dreamer
I never worked office female programmer planet
emilov said I worked major IT company without female
There woman management support release management Database support none app development

Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right
IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year
Random Awesomeness said discourage people KIDS especially woman want computer please give reason people computer science
Wolfee GameZ said Yea boi game design would good choice knowing code knowing language
Would also help look animation easier opinion
Those two major thing used game
yeye John Doe said Hey everyone Thanks comment really helped
I college student getting basic way
I always loved computer I pretty good user level
I know HTML access command stuff I never formal education tried learn another coding language I never failed math generally making Bs As strongest subject
Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get
Any advice appreciated thank much
Chris said I trying pursue computer science degree I get gaming industry
I also thinking something creative writing well

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

I work small tech company process engineer
During first couple year I saw need way record data created data driven intranet app could record process data maintenance record processed text file inserted SQL database
This worked pretty well job I hired fault started show
Eventually needed hire someone build application replace mine chose fucking thing MS access
In bit schadenfreude run slow shit I laugh every time I see trying use
Anyways I LOVED programming I
I loved writing code debugging trying figure turn real world problem code
You could spend day two problem perseverance enough research could figure felt good
It like every day new victory
It felt great make something would save someone company time would use
So I work another part company I trying find thing automate code much need done manager would rather pay professional get done quickly pay sit desk learn programming
The big problem I happy
I really like enjoy job
My goal would help small company develop data driven apps similar I company perhaps develop mobile apps
I fish pond
Does every Tom Dick Harry know code also want
It seems like could tough market
I sure I probably enjoy lot job top mind
I think I would want work large firm small part job I idea programmer large company actually
How much actually enjoyable work
With goal mind I trying make decision either Stay job learn program much I
Pick side job get work practice
What else would good way proceed
I feel like weakness I would learn way program given problem
Keep working I go community college learn programming
I well formal I think I would well option learn
Definitely database class I think
Quit job go back school full time
I live near large public university I went undergrad
My wife final year program internship next year
This could tough financially could done
Would worth goal mind
I certainly open something else I listed I really want help write next version metro UI unless sabotage
I would probably take loan first couple year
Am I crazy
Post comment
Life short final dream
It hard question wonder sacrifice worth
You wonder old date touch everything make
I know I wondered often many decision I made college graduate looking friend graduated year career family everything else I often think I missed something
Still I know I anyone else
I prospect important
I stuck late night stress freakouts quiet moment extreme self loathing self doubt
I
No one take away I better
If CS want think shot better life pursuing owe people love rely see
I say GO FOR IT
You want death bed regret trying
Great advice
I looking go university advice really help
Thanks
Start taking community college class
This also great advice I two year community college I HIGHLY recommend pathway
Lots great teacher class
Never ever give dream
Life draw last breath
I try live philosophy every day easy worth
good advice
I work industry
Got lucky good position learn grow
Was way CS degree I got chance work full time programming quit education
I regret
I would feel lot comfortable getting another job I right
I still want go back finish degree
Though family current job negates
If willing make sacrifice
You got priority make sense individual owe pursue
Sounds like thing worked well
I glad
This kind motivational speech get saying Fuck Yeah
screen
Well done
Thank
Its sort like abridged version paragraph I glad enjoyed
WaywardPatriot said
Marvelous motivation text indeed
Even though I year old I also made similiar decision life recently
I dont similiar education friend age like
So I study lot actually pas exam university I
Now I studying computer science still time I doubting capability end I push forward path I truly want take
Good ya
Keep
Ca wait graduation update post
I currently freaking work I final year CS degree
This EXACTLY I needed hear
And OP go
Despite current freak going uni best decision I ever made
I always thought old incapable let feel
Glad see I alone assertion That inspiring
Thanks
I amazed helped
You welcome
year old CS student
Thank
You got
I expect see graduation post finish honor
Also computer science great field opposed say architecture Older folk seem study discipline focus want education
At least experience
yeah old people best
You see know exactly fully motivated
I contemplating whether betting I always wanted attempt get land pursue higher education career programming searched I old found message
Thank
I fucking
I one life
It ai stop breathing got nothing lose regret
Good speed fellow traveler
I wish perseverance complete determination voyage
You make always believe
I currently reddit freak due going back c degree How much know
I ball park I know nothing
So freaking quite bit
I started teaching java far I lot fun
Math though going kill
I moment absolute brilliance followed screaming I idea wrong
I learning Java also visual basic Ha ha
I love I many similar moment
Awesome advice Thanks sometimes I say good stuff
Most time I
This deserves bestof I modest accept praise thank consideration
Damn I love insightful people reddit Edmund Burke All take evil succeed good men nothing Coincidentally one favorite time quote
I thinking getting tattooed somewhere part larger piece still gestating idea though
My goal would help small company develop data driven apps similar I company perhaps develop mobile apps
A CS degree necessary sort thing moreover CS degree learning program
A regular university degree computer science like one two intro programming class mostly thing like algorithm compiler design language abstract sense learning code various language
Have read university requirement
My impression different expecting likely want
Edit sample four year schedule UCLA CS degree
While many course might arguably make someone better flexible programmer long run OP stated fairly specific goal I believe helped CS degree even say UCLA
If want learn enjoys process value abstract knowledge regardless whether help achieve specific goal comfortable financial strain possibility exact place job market four year I also say go
But belief would better given stated goal spending time developing application
If financial strain college bearable taking three month see learn build might also option would give lot practical programming experience better idea type training need get desired job actual product use portfolio part job search
OP say want degree say want take class
That said learning program lot learning algorithm learning language I think mixture algorithm class language class would useful
Just taking language class trying work programmer cheating
He indicate considering going back school full time couple year fair assume would culminate degree
Keep mind though opportunity cost taking class
They come financial cost also possibly place month spent building application learning program another opinion practical way
You correct
For someone looking program maybe degree IT MIS would give coding experience
Compiler design like capstone area study programmer
Take time study programming paradigm compiler construction programmatic mean interfacing computer would reach
I programming decade never received formal computer science education
I web application developer wo see writing custom parser neat technology company
It beyond reach along job contract require kind ability
I agree disagree say
I hit SO many wall career due lack degree
I finally got one though I feel like I learned school entirely practical profession many door opened closed
Companies increasingly looking piece paper
OP say already degree though mean could go back school MS CS wanted would attractive company lot fun
I would definitely recommend going community college first enrolling many programming language class wish learn
That I currently I loving every minute
I pipe
At least experience University hell lot intro course programming
After second glance I think intent wrote I took I obtained University degree take Intro Programming Programming I II Cryptography Network Security Object Oriented Program Design Algorithms Software Operating Systems Programming Language Concepts Computer Ethics Data File Structures
This also include capstone project various engineering computer math course
I go grain bit usual need degree program
Without trying conceded I work company good portion software programmer actually Electrical engineer
While phenomenal low level programming miss design portability aspect I indoctrinated University
And I get frustrated decide write custom application need write portable reusable application
So I think University worth
Yes point
There lot taught programming via classroom
There experience code teach important lesson
And side programming stop learning become obsolete
However someone great software developer without degree
Yes
And like ManahManah said look University program determine want learn
As someone recently went back school CS graduated age You absolutely right
College day fucking expensive light practical knowledge
You expected learn coding stuff internship class
Classes background theory
A regular university degree computer science like one two intro programming class mostly thing like algorithm compiler design language abstract sense learning code various language
Could elaborate
I OP I obtained Associates Science trying figure university transfer Computer Science Software Engineering Applied Computer Programming
I much interested software development side thing much working hardware But I understand engineering
From software development entrepreneurial sense apps writing program working game company even front
A CIS degree considered business degree rather science I still prefer science degree
Although ultimately note CS actually emphasize programming I heard mixed opinion whether emphasized part le said abstract quite might engineering degree
deleted That true I really tough
Of course I get distracted idea trying teach people programming much I idea trying learn Also get hard stay motivated actual workplace I distraction
I reading become software engineer someone class age I going college next year I looking software science
I interest hardware aspect computer development
I told software engineering combine
Would care take minute explain actually involved software engineering
It much appreciated
In honesty I far yet
I recently began
You want someone actual degree explain
I sorry I pretty sure I could give explanation need
That perfectly fine
Thanks though
And good luck
I idea programmer large company actually
Because I would suggest immediately quit job start learning programming
I finished Masters lot theoretical computer science Yes I employable programmer
I job market long I found good job
That said one best thing programming lot way learn programming
I would say major reason ANY kind formal education programming connection would provide
So recommendation wondering fairly conservative
Do quit job
At least right away
I would work introductory programming course try something pique interest codeschool feel like pretty good language study coursera another mooc edx udacity
Now serious programming finish course Mooc
And ca convince worth putting extra hour week I scared programming might right
The guy I work work hour would stay late continue working home something needed done
Look good programming right
You comfortable
You need try learn lot right
And doubt remember around corner job enjoyable work environment
Now important part programming besides learning project finishing couple Moocs help keep coding thing projecteuler kaggle meetups help give project connection
So need go meetups
You need find people interested programming hang
And need find enjoyable
You need ask job tell story You changing career direction learning programming
Attend least meetup per week try go conference per year look interesting
If question ask ask
And By mean unhappy job look new one
But wait found new one quit current job Looking new job necessarily entail sending resume getting reference letter
I think could conference wherever go mention work interested see anyone bite
If company needed work done certainly others
Just try keep learning
Thank excellent advice
I one geezer year old looking land programming job embedded preferably anything C Python related cool
And yes I know age work
I went community college earn programming certificate life happened career took different course
Over year I continued learning I finally great company I put skill use programming job I truly want
One thing I never thought attend meetups
I amazingly awkward public simply terrified I make fool roomful genius
However I think leap I make I want get I want
You know I found I go meetup something mind discus new article project I working I fairly prepared potential discussion
One thing I found programming community people love help
And people happy explaining idea solution providing link useful tool
Best luck
This described situation really well
It take lot effort find balance required make kind thing happen
The fact better degree CS knowledge mean work overall end
It better learn manage early
Otherwise stress enormous
If crazy pretty much every programmer crazy
Try
Oh excellent thanks subreddit
I known thing
edit similar thread I keep eye post needed
similar thread Which one could find
I believe mean Thanks realize mention school title
Dude aware site like
Just pick course pace
Those course taught people specialist highly relevant current job market
The best part exercise desktop work
Considering situation I would advise site really want stay relevant
I also heard Udacity offering MS collaboration GaTech
However I remember specific
If want go dig site
I would learn best way program given problem
I found mediocre university couple wholesome class really taught anything
The rest either mental chewing gum something said else complete bullshit value gained learning life lesson dealing bullshit
By time I started working main skill I applied one I taught tinkering linux teenager programming class I took throughout year
My advice would keep working take class per semester programming language interested
That really depends school
I programmed job ten year getting degree programmed kid year
When I started I thought nothing get another checkbox resume
However I lucky enough live near school good CS program I wound learning surprising amount
I guess one thing I stress people considering based others I talked CS degree equal
Mind telling
I professional web application developer year I programming since I
So ten year overall
I dropped college I would love go back school really great CS program point
How become professional without degree
I like job always wished I pursued programming Bachelor degree actually required lot web development position especially small midsized company
If good enough company hire regardless paper say
I people interested company ranging people size company employee worldwide
My web development track like UI design HTML CSS JavaScript interactivity JavaScript jQuery maybe kind templating system processing I use IIS MVC C tech work
Does really matter one choose long
Google us Python Java UI system programming I sure lot web stuff
Persistence storing stuff SQL NoSQL database
I use SQL Server work
If done one project start finish look good thing way ahead student honesty
You qualified internship point
The exception job research intense engineering data analysis
People system engineering really low stuff like almost never get job without CS degree
Starting wage kind position anywhere though
Every I hear someone graduating Master degree computer science starting spending much time researching work basically free university probably pretty smart person worth decent wage
I even done college dropout fact even Associate Degree first development job internship year
In word become professional developer professional developer going school someone else tell somebody professional developer
If skill got job
Feel free ask detail
Sorry I came vague imagine lot type I got work I definitely thinking today
Thank
I went science got lucky enough find job I love go way Im hoping glass ceiling without MS PhD tl dr old X
No want
No one care go ahead fun c sound fun
It like die fail anything
Similarly I started scratch c degree community college
I bit bullet went back awesome resource stanford harvard really tough know advance skill set without going head
I found great course online sort person take something abstract learn make project happen would good
I found many gap fill
Sure I read book javascript read eloquent javascript really hard jump stuff sure studying next appropriate level without one guide
I felt like martial artist master solo guy colonizing Mars
That feel like
I wish good people others subreddits could come learning track list free even paid online course order taken even identify void schedule need filling
Edit Remembered called curriculum
Derp
And turn Khan Academy among others probably working programming curriculum
Not sure open suggestion charge developing curriculum Khan Academy
This exactly problem I
I feel like I need recipe everyone telling start shopping ingredient first
Can anyone legwork post recommended curriculum based free resource Internet one leave people feeling like gap
I seen least four posted sub
Google around
For sure
I trying work independent study thing
Maybe I make post
I quite good level success time least
Anyone interested post want point appropriate subreddit
I would love hear going
Consider reminding I make post within day
I swamped work
I spare time
deleted Do
As I mentioned another reply I programming job year getting CS degree
I learned stuff class I know I ever come across
I regret one bit
I went back school computer science degree
My first career wholesale mortgage banking
I hated everyone know lost job
My advice start community college still working make sure path
You make far money degree
As enjoying job I love
When love program almost matter working
Almost
If avoid position maintenance existing project like bos wo regret
Not mention pay rewarding well
I I freshman year
I work full time go school full time community college
I transferring year university year
I want career change I something
I always felt I gone college high school I tired regretting decision
If I live like I plan I lived life still long way go
I never allow think I old I want
I loved writing code debugging trying figure turn real world problem code
You could spend day two problem perseverance enough research could figure felt good
You got
This core programmer soul
Does every Tom Dick Harry know code also want
Actually I think fantasize creating next facebook Minecraft
It seems like could tough market
It tough good programmer easy mindset acquire seems like got
Aside super easy market demand much greater supply long time
I idea programmer large company actually
How much actually enjoyable work
It depends entirely company
There politics process deal company big small
Good stuff large software company They programmer amortize thing make programming efficient greater number people
Some automated tool make coder life easier worth five programmer
The whole org chart greater appreciation
If company main business something else internal software way get job often seen cost minimized
Lots programmer learn
It hard understate
Good stuff small shop company make software living Can easier get hired
There lot programmer trying get Google Microsoft etc
Smaller company attract much attention easier get foot door
It easier seen star
Many company realize much better software improve business know little
If show whip automation sometimes hero
Careful though automate someone job away run risk backlash
Stay job learn program much I
Pick side job get work practice
What else would good way proceed
This safe avenue worked lot people
One thing learn contribute open source project
Find one like see help
Keep working I go community college learn programming
I well formal I think I would well option learn
If learn best school setting definitely
Quit job go back school full time
Programming one career path degree necessary
Look financial investment
You going spend lot cash cost lost wage time school purchase degree
Will investment pay lifetime career
My hunch
It sound like already got fundament right mindset
Learning like programmer hardest step
Everything past learning technology
If I shoe I keep learning eventually start applying programming job
Play software experience already résumé
Good luck
age I went back school CS degree
age I went school Master Information Assurance
I I job absolutly miserable I recently started new job help friend absolutly great
Additionally I year experience belt I get job offer time company recruters
Go
I finish diploma Mobile Development I may take class get degree
For first time I feel like I chance career instead series menial job
I glad I took chance program
A year half ago I told parent I going back school father said But graduate
I replied And old I year half I DO go
ETA Yes time suck
I unemployed almost year husband lost job last week
We make lot sacrifice making even next couple month
Still worth
I wasting time classroom employer bill engineer intern
Everything useful I know I learned google
It okay switch career feel right give income
It sound harsh I really think would like time
I studied two guy year old
Both used Computer Scientists several year ago wrote Fortran asm
They choose programming module studied OpenGL OpenCV
They I think loved even I EDIT I hope love
Sorry hear love course loved
I got military year ago went back school computer science
There thing I love thing I hate
My biggest piece advice understand program decide go top bottom best starting
I went community college bit supposed transfer directly thing transferred elective bullshit damaging ability graduate time GI Bill
That said make sure research teacher take review grain salt plan accordingly
Try get hand best math teacher possible easy one best one
That always help end
take review grain salt This absolutely important
Whether ratemyprofessor Yelp Google Places whatever voluntary review system like bring people feel really strongly one way another
Dude may prof gave exam someone study enough failed bam shittiest prof ever
I also giant cuntbag professor intro programming course bunker hill community college
She focused thing like perfection user input instead solving thing
We required make dynamic excel table life told I enough time chore
I
All work group work weekly report meeting commuter school
I several argument go dean
She picked personal note graded note taking ability final though wasnt fucking page syllabus
I comp sci TA highschool left working nuclear engineering submarine
I helping A student would blatantly grade homework harder
No network submit thing submitted via email
Totally fucked GI bill like
In case raging cunt take math course
When I passed A summer without studying transferred I found count
Was fucking furious
giant cuntbag professor I think I talking I said voluntary review system bring people feel really strongly one way another
I saying wrong indeed giant cuntbag sound like pretty awful
No brainer
Go study community college keep working
Think way You find middle wood
You walked programming track enjoyed experience keep going likely get hopelessly lost confused unless natural gift programming
You see community college offer map wood navigate way employability land personal perseverance least supply keep fed
Alternatively university opposite college offer fantastic personal growth experience broadens horizon provides unbelievable career opportunity really talented lucky minority graduate great personal cost reducing meagre ration journey whilst still leading employability land
If community college experience turn well get job want always find pathway study university later
Last year I went college builder wanted retrain want carrying brick ladder I
The dude prior experience got one highest grade class
It doable
Being programmer le smart recognizing pattern using tool available correct tool job knowing find answer
The rest perseverance problem solved
You job sustaining
I know unemployed within last ten year pretty right
Retain job take night class
Full time uni surround year old wildly different life culture
You learn specific trade skill looking learn bunch theoretical stuff top basic coding stuff
Night class
Whatever choose never old
Good luck
The big problem I happy
I really like enjoy job
Out word post one matter
period
To answer question I think age relevant age happiness accounted know answer learn programming left
I think answer lie solely said learn well formal environment informal one
If ok informal training worry much learning best way program given problem come experience
Never quit job income coming start working tutorial find online spare time
Also start thinking thing someone know would find useful
Start building
The first time build wo greatest I guarantee hit snag research
Keep improving even start scratch get knowledge need
As yr old current CS Junior I say Yes
The money issue big one since mentioned I assuming wary starting
It exactly I started I able hang
The biggest reason I say yes happy current job
Maybe could wait wife internship
A lot people saying need degree CS young single able work way without support family
In order get job need graduating yr old CS degree required
Remember competing bright young mind require le salary
The competitiveness definitely push without degree
Especially
That great degree CS worker always learning CS beginning create many hole knowledge
Start taking one class time might take forever get eventually
I started year ago I almost see end list class
It suck go slow I still job house eventually I degree CS well I I work IT unrelated degree
I often think going back master IT I keep putting I probably eventually die instead
Keep day job side company like hire young coder looking graduate
It better keep day job study programming side
There much free online material start waiting course begin
Also note many CS course mostly theoretical
Yes
Community college class fantastic deal taught people wisdom bad point intellectually damaging
You aptitude appetite already starting resume
Computer programming one career easily pay student loan
Also easily find work school including IT programming job campus
Plus lot people know public university way community college
If near overlook option
When come higher education question always
Are money passion topic
My college degree helped much long run except resume item
But experience learning expanding knowledge field I love invaluable
There reason take ton time learn program
There metric shit ton coding help online
Figure basic project make spare time use subreddit stackoverflow guide get stuck question
If disciplined could set month
When get point small project without much struggle start applying
Know probably take bit pay cut get first job
If undergrad degree consider looking master program CS
I got undergraduate degree business went master c
All class night still work full time take class would waste time The fact dipped toe rather enjoyed good thing
I think main thing budget make sure afford school since neither really much income
Definitely cut thing need spend like TV example cell phone etc
Being stressed finance make difficult focus study well
One thing consider spending bit free time learning diving sure
Try thing bit save bit current job
Do know next enrolment would I imagine sometime would even able start school
Does bos others company know want move programming enjoy
It could possible would even pay school
Though know case sick company quitting might good idea
Just thought
I advice somewhat similar position though year younger
Still decided whether pursue well suited classroom environment exam
Good luck whatever decide
Yeah
You one life live
Why spend want
You leave world without money
Who care take year career want
No one remember year
As long
Set financially
Dont week week money
Dont loan upon loan
If case go
Otherwise bear witb work year save
Source bioinformatics programmer bored wanted build spaceship
Entered engineering program Keep working I go community college learn programming
I well formal I think I would well option learn
Definitely database class I think
Quit job go back school full time
I live near large public university I went undergrad
Why take class large public university student
Anyway learn Do worry much getting degree
You already engineering one
Worry getting enough CS good programmer
You easily write couple apps put github show people
Go stay job learn
You supplement community college need
Regular college going drain finance teach nothing ca learn
At stage life skill matter degree show job apply
My two cent
Also applies especially sound like want consultant maybe company
If case DONT get degree piece paper meaningless potential client
What done field matter
Your resume former client completed project
Note I general case would financial mistake
It would
You focus learning working current job supplement course need take one
If go regular college remember suddenly forced take curriculum stuff necessarily AND gen ed probably took year ago
And paying time money
Community college tech school whatever want call exactly doctor ordered
I thing
I need classroom time soak thing ask question I get near immediate answer
I someone look code give instant feedback
I still work day I generally pick choose course I want
I certificate I done I put resume along experience cost year worth university would
I I day away getting Bachelors CIS
I stuck tech support roll year I got point I HATED
I went back school basically full time continuing work
I coded side busted as
It horrible
It soooooo much work
I lost touch friend
I barely see daughter girlfriend
It drained saving put debt
Work help payed schooling
About month ago I got job programmer annalist
I work LOVE I learning daily
By end year I degree hand life slow
I look forward taking week work spending time everyone I miss
It suck
You hate
You question constantly
Hopefully work
I know I stress much I wish
Go man good luck
I support going back school case I believe absolutely necessary great programmer
My bg comp info sci bachelor degree prog professionally year I graduated I I
I learn programming school
I got base understanding though
For example I learned data structure exist got play around little I mean proficient writing tree never write one professionally either date
Reading provide understanding easily focused language comp sci program
In I got inter job surrounded brilliant programmer
The atmosphere relaxed red tape big corp crap
I tech customer intern dev able sit talk lead devs day
I learned job reading Effective scott meyers
School gave minimum computer programming logic truth table idempotence etc data structure
It enough practical use definitely enough prepare implant code real job
Arguably something could easily read chapter algorithm book
However learning write compiler taking compiler class give leg others never app dev want going compiler class could unnecessary
Some company oogle sheet paper say CS degree
Two three job worked programmer require degree
If write good clean code cared
YMMV though
My main point based experience go school read text programming tutorial book able teach someone else read true understanding material
Surround programmer classmate work colleague
Come reddit site stack overflow ask question
People help
I started process engineer
I found lot data
And I went back school programming
Go
And Access could faster le error prone prgrammed better
I fix someone else Access program plant SPC data
If developer large company small part larger project least experience
I think maybe time spent enjoyable work ie actual development rest etc
Firstly I would look exactly want achieve going back school
Then I would look course offer corresponding subject see much I could take night school I went real college
It might worth look conversion master program ie computer science people already hold degree discipline
I would say start shopping around
Look posting see kind requirement
Get touch hiring manager see kind need actually beyond posted
The process time consuming course give clearer picture much really lacking
The way described passion small project tell mindset succeed
You also advantage already dealt politics office
You curious
Feed curiosity
You may able get trained work
Here take couple programming class Community college
That tell pretty much whether cut I started year term college course last year I
I really love
I worked IT year always development side I thought I would get actual training
I well job prospect looking good
As software engineer I learned everything
School taught look thing book
Where I work dont lot text book laying around
We use google tinker figure
I say pick language interested get free tool grab tutorial guide go
A degree might help get foot door sound like already done somewhat
I high school taking class community college
I studying networking lot people computer science class older
Some best friend I made year old
Some come old career others getting started
Most importantly reason would happier something love
Its never late get started especially community college expensive
You even lot learning free looking degree
If think make happy go
I thinking going back
Ended taking chemistry class local community college instead
Also found pretty great programming I even class online though offer class well
When I going college I would probably said something snobby community college thing right
The focus education nothing else ca tell I went big univ huh
It also least
And DO end wanting full CS degree transfer save lot dough
Anyways I LOVED programming I Explain interview next programming job
I freshman CS university I assure worry sticking lot older student
I year half ago
You advantage older mature go long way college
At least community college
I met maybe two guy around really give fuck
If ace class get teacher noticing nice recommendation getting started
My community college offer associate applied science information technology
It requires le waste time gen ed le math let take hand programming class
In CS I would exposed little Java rest high level math literature class
With current program I get two semester Java web standard comprehensive database
I think relevant wan na
I currently school going CS degree
I graduate Spring everything pan right
There day I feel like everybody looking like I crazy ill old school day I feel experience I school greatly benefit
Most people care
While I research paper I found undergrad surveyed nationwide age greater
Source American College Health Association National College Health Assessment
Reference Group Data Report
Spring
So tidbit knowledge knocked whatever insecurity I age
Age confidence greatest challenge
School requires study skill writing skill motivation improve performance
Those skill think know high school
They apply year educational paradigm change also find missing degraded
I went community college awhile transferred state university
Even year cc belt I still struggled keep work horrible time management difficulty assignment
I also tried working part time job commuting school
This made MISERABLE
I strongly suggest integrating school activity like club service greek organization
Commuting make getting class hard long commute stressed weather suck
In experience I started missing class escalated caused stress I make work end beg teacher forgiveness
Since I moved near school I find near impossible justify missing class since I minute away
It also lot easier go study group meet classmate impromptu study
Enough personal anecdote onto go back college As others said CS degree going focus abstract concept related programming necessarily programming
Usually intro class teach programming syntax java usually data structure computer design o design compiler design etc plus elective
The great thing CS degree concept learned used language
It teach solve problem efficiently rather playing debugger hoping find issue
If go good school always job fair major network literally company one day
Career Services also huge database contact hook internship
This college defines value somebody like
It give open door new employer expect strict qualification willing let prove job
Programming club mobile apps hot nowadays give project put resume apart class going take
Make friend seduce helping program whatever interested programming
CS degree student excited program outside classroom
Financially government pretty liberal loan probably get lot aid
I would look state university offer great tuition rate even better financial aid package school
So crazy really want
Good night
Computer science degree would much like undergraduate degree science
Heavy math theory
The main use quantitative degree case teenager nobody trust ca find job
You would also little programming type like
If love Project Euler Calculus problem back napkin like General Eisenhower computer science may
If find either frustrated worse unable complete since quantitative degree mathematics
You would need minimum one year preparation get math back level high school senior trigonometry Calculus finite mathematics even consider going back
And graduated would starting lowest low code monkey
Again I clear computer science almost mathematics programming class
The average compsci grad anything github know anything relational database relational database theory elective idea put product together testing
The advantage computer science degree quantitative degree like others give job since company recruit straight class
Neither enough reason go back alone
Instead playing game opponent turf playing advantage high school student I would play advantage
Namely wealth experience networking stability
For student get thousand thousand dollar loan make startup huge deal
But probably pocket change
If want program look online course like teach theory practical skill need make publish deliverable
You seem want take control life
To really bos
I believe wo happy unless power code solve want want
A CS degree wo necessarily teach program least real world
While may learn concept mechanic computer science wo teach core development skill like write code give accurate project estimate manage software project version control testing managing etc
The additional downside going back school full time potentially getting debt may job
This especially true looking develop mobile apps
A CS degree probably wo teach anything mobile development would learn diving employer care experience got CS degree
I would also recommend researching actual software development job maybe start side project see really something interested full time
Some time even best thing turn drag hour week
No
Downvotes left
Downvote without explaining good reason
You go play You dont need stack bill set behind stage game especially CS degree
Most class complete crap want program learn especially programming plenty free online course
Source HS dropout owns profitable software dev firm since I
If live large city look computer club
I ca say I agree
I done sort internet I always seem lack person ask question really question surrounding something question computer language work way
Besides said well classroom setting
Perhaps one simply read understand I definitely
He say either
I think year college degree necessary right
I guessing tech school route would right least course like I get programmer mindset heading Google resource language
I commend starting company I bet took quite bit time effort well someone may disposal
I guessing whichever age OP say personal financial obligation average early mid
My source year old married guy trying something similar several year later commitment
It tough
I done sort internet I always seem lack person ask question really question surrounding something question computer language work way
I sure I agree either still able find people ask question
I agree
BUT For love pete check class committing
I took CS class Kansas State absolute SUCK
It amounted waste money material could learned week enthusiasm material
They nearly student wanted piece paper management job required
They idea desire learn big deal programming
You need vibrant creative place computer club people modding phone nintendos mindstorm robot group finding bug fun
You want around people better also teach people eager learn know
Most university fail hard thing CS dept
The absolute best way learn jump position absolutely unqualified guy mentor
Shut mouth observe take note first week
Try fail hard completely alone second week
Then observe week asking question epiphany youll get
The rest detail
Well consolation graduated early fine art degree learning ok slowly I weighing worth
Your age
still worth going sure start slow internahip done maybe
Then time soak industry figure clearly like
It like Pandora box whack mole get architecture language stack application need minute become clear

It never late
I computer programming college city plenty student
I share experience Went school age graduated degree software engineering
Got job kept month
Got laid well I working grocery store
Same exact job I left go school debt
I occasionally get job offer would require move another state I making usually contractor position MUCH larger cost living
I got disgusted
Now I make free time
I tell one thing much enjoyable way suck I need debt much hobby I could learned online free
Oh job year forget anyone taking serious
I actually asshole interviewer say well worked year hire
If I I would done community college thing rather expensive college gotten internship
No experience mean one hire mean wo get experience mean year one give fuck college

If degree jump hoop get one
My personal experience salary almost doubled literally day I got CS degree
If one computer science I suggest might better pursuing certification relevant field working
If currently field asking get degree go position call
You probably need degree break even
If worth starting scratch go
Fortunately I got hired company I currently I
Unfortunately going RFP process outsource job
If I lucky I spared
If I I working contracter job I
If I really shit outta luck I job market worst economy I ever known
It wo easy least I CS degree help stand due respect people like
I mean cruel mean difference whether I eating cat food I use every advantage I beat aforementioned job market including fact I CS degree
So knowing asked question advice yes worthwhile piece paper
Great great response
I know poster asking whether I really older reader currently trying piss away perhaps find useful well
You blessing front strong desire something namely go school get CS degree
If passionate right need take advantage energy make effective use effort
I top CS program many classmate read life experience average student student often one setting curve ask best question motivated take advantage opportunity available better enrich quality program
Some advice I might offer young student
Most friend older student tend bit disconnected rest University
Do make mistake much might think graduate student even age academic life revolve around department
At least fill gen ed requirement
More importantly undergraduate university resource helpful enriching education
Make friend highly motivated younger student even outside dept tend aware thing help get connected
You focused objective
But undergraduate college year excellent time take risk go different direction may previously seen going
Do university breeding ground opportunity might surprised door might open trying something new
Good luck
Actually decent natural filter company would hire reason one want work anyways
I also work tech firm age problem office either
If someone passionate career stay date relevant whole life
Actually decent natural filter company would hire reason one want work anyways
For starter state would illegal
On top company eager hire younger worker others younger worker cheaper b easier overwork
It smarter better coding anything like
Note study undisputed
Also made today population good sample thats one reason dispute
Basically people today often learned much longer much older generation attitude learning one job ONCE never anything else
I would surprised see vastly different result study say year
Other study also showed younger mind faster also make error older one
This likely go hand hand experience
I denying decline I arguing actual impact
It certainly NOT good discrimination IT
IT several fundamental pattern mechanism etc
learn well recognize almost everywhere
Once managed learning new technology understanding becomes significantly easier
Learning pattern done young age recognizing applying well something anybody age could really important bit operative IT
Everything IT change every five year I going call bullshit statement
The thing change every year popular programming language method amount computing resource available
As far software engineering concept go really anything new year
The relational data model still valid requirement analysis often called test first TDD sic still thing first peer review still best way reduce defect
Everything IT change every five year must assume responsibility lifelong learning
I manager
Learn done people change
The model stable year
Note study undisputed
Also made today population good sample thats one reason dispute
Basically people today often learned much longer much older generation attitude learning one job ONCE never anything else
I would surprised see vastly different result study say year
I agree skepticism study
It year study appear following individual year testing group course year
There also multitude factor could play part result like graduated college thus broader knowledge base increased test taking skill
Most importantly say nothing magnitude decline gain area
Starting point also relevant piece information
For example maybe I start cognitive agility rating decline age age big deal
I put lot weight studied individual course year age age
Also putting control factor profession mental exercise perform diet
The study interesting open door research really tell u anything
And OP although I average developer age I work mid late
You might bias younger people like gaming company work like slave newcomer willing experience working others important thing like every engineering profession
I late studying CS moving math
probably headed grad school combination eye towards category type theory work
Definitely younger kid quick lack depth
I work really bright young kid math class great work sometimes hit clue bat get see broader implication
I see sitting around thinking math example working apply newly learned technique problem
Note I speaking generality
I know
I couple internship interview though definitely little awkward
You answer question like Why making change life
It always easy explain I think believe say something like truth I along I realized
For I accept I good I love
If monetary reward form job come point great
I looking learning I want learn grad school maybe beyond trying get research possibly teaching
If I never get job banging code okay
I already spare time open source project I necessarily feel drive prove job
As AC said I heartily recommend going back school
School adult face get age realize young adult yet though exception vastly different younger person
It also definitely best thing I ever done marrying gal Mental ability peak Memory
However ability relying accumulated experience like vocabulary peak
Can remember reference recent article
So yes sharper read RFC faster
Big deal experience attitude play huge part efficiency developer
Which company like Google appears take little account actual experience geeky quiz loos
They ca package standard procedure evaluating experience tend largely leave recruitment process
Which I think stupid since skill make successful developer quite different skill get college
Heck whole mentality working project quite different school project
In school project week trying understand clarify prof actually want day hacking together minimal pile garbage barely
In real world actually care overall architecture design methodology coordinating team maintainability testability etc
wait enough experience participate pissing contest younger applicant lot soft skill HAVE working right
know problem people problem technical problem know work towards resolving issue done much something like learning yet another language big deal learn plus bring idiom solving problem language bear
You also longer fear death march project since survived enough
Unless looking warm body stuff pretty much rote case question sharp enough stupid boring enough leave something interesting month
I add little someone interviewed lot people Net Admin job past year
For u huge missing factor younger applicant quite simply maturity
The advantage older applicant front ca overstated
Kids tendency engage guerrilla maintenance call
Just reboot see come back without considering take production
Kids also tendency see bigger picture IT fit rest company
You box ITIL process keep dumb thing
Kids also also good leadership situation dealing others
Those disadvantage question poster might use advantage
It always true I got year old team broken description although student mine year ago I sure someone else post disadvantage face older advantage younger
Read consider minimize looking job working got
Although biggest disadvantage I seen older applicant come industry late low expectation career
Shoot star mud
As Programmer thats programmer big I finished working project programmer
Their current framework opensource knowledge high
But several thing experience came
One said I person ever heard want immediately work absolute lastest version framework dealing
Having worked Bank decade knowing price framework shift cost unintended consiquences I shake head
One also used Set class List called solved obscure exception problem experienced
I tried let know using wrong data type would give headache road
He also would spend day looking way getting framework wanted half day actual programming would
So world filter buzz word technology lost fundemental activity programming art honed experience exposure practice
You tell difference journeyman plumber master plumber
The master plumber walk look problem walk van brings back need fix problem
He also know way fix problem chooses think appropriate second
Its older good programmer
What hopefully I class subtle efficient like good engineering hidden view plain work looking simple obvious suggest one long experience could plopped code naturally
As degree represents condensed exposure envirionments technique approach thinking solving problem invaluable pay attention
Recent research actually show mental faculty begin decline early life
Kids seem sharper ARE sharper
That say good employee older individual advantage basis IT discrimination based age
ecent research actually show mental faculty begin decline early life
There fixed
The truth lot simpler people put brain neutral get school
The brain like tissue use atrophy
Even BONE leach calcium subjected regular stress ordinary thing walking around
The average person read book
They get information echo chamber internet short ephemeral snippet register eyeball brain second later onto next oh shiny
Then thare people life continuous learning experience keep learning stay current curiosity lead u continue learning continue integrating new fact attitude knowledge world around u
BTW also study show genius probably result combination curiosity plus persistence
Staying date never restore cognitive ability level peaked begin show measurable decline
You cognitive ability pry cold dead brain

Age wisdom youth treachery I put money old guy win
Here easiest way see ever watch three year old playing ball living room
When ball go coffee table kid go get know exactly going happen next
The kid going stand full speed bang hell head underside table
It going happen faster anything stop wish could jump prevent ca sure enough BAM
followed half hour cry
You knew going happen even happened knew kid clue world hurt could watch happen
The kid even know know yet three year old simply belief world revolves around
Fast forward year story different tabletop different headache
Age wisdom youth treachery I put money old guy win
I thought Age treachery v youth speed When ball go coffee table kid go get know exactly going happen next
The kid going stand full speed bang hell head underside table
I spotted old day hard hard provoke screaming
He spent next minute carefully proving hitting head table caused pain hitting couple time gently bit harder see hurt
I astounded level reasoning going worked happened head caused
It language framework library done year last could
In twenty second time text character mean limited essentially It good It sucked contract XXX YYY lead N others assuming number contact list
Your point
Anyone care want information going want call afterward anyway
BTW engineer usually make lousy rep business trade show
You hire sale personnel reason
Again done least hardware specification bus us standard bus enough hardware monitoring screwed

Since majority folk dealing going older might want take care come negotiation make u want deal
The good news probably get smarter get older
As someone else interview lot candidate I agree parent
Age play factor
I happily recommend year old man woman job well
I think lot impression ageism come fact older generation grow computer
As result fewer working computer field leading impression computer young man game
Of course younger generation getting older
So getting common see older programmer
As time go age distribution begin smoothing apparent ageism disappear
Just based assumption people become agreeable age Errrr
I disagreeable cuss I twenty
By time I I unbearable
Today
I ca even stand room
All age treachery always triumph youth naivete
Just based assumption people become agreeable age What people like disagreeable twenty unbearable even I ca stand room
Of course younger generation getting older
So getting common see older programmer You know reached significant threshold start seeing artificial hip technology advertised ThinkGeek
My titanium hip replacement act range booster Blackberry
As someone else interview lot candidate I agree parent
Age play factor
Age matter hiring process I understand impact hiring decision
Some people hard time much younger bos likely older candidate hired industry especially older candidate straight university
Also crazy dot company like work employee bone older employee likely real responsibility family health issue life etc
backbone stand take company crap
Of course making generalization could also say young foolish irresponsible
I think lot impression ageism come fact older generation grow computer
Sounds like accurate assesment I tell
I using computer since I year old got hand Atari membrane keyboard started teaching program
I moved Atari VIC Commodore Commodore Amigas Apple I II IIc Macintoshes finally PC
I taught BASIC Assembly kid learned PASCAL high school C FORTRAN college
I able finish degree reason health I seem reached stability health even age I considering getting back programming finishing degree
The fact think older generation grow computer
qulifies show least ignorance worst ageism
I think response show worry least foundation fact
I would nevertheless encourage go back get degree reason show snotnoses one skill
Wow
That completely uncalled
Did even pay attention
Or read one sentence decide go tirade
You obviously missed I pointing generation prior home computer existing
I even ended post If taken time apply critical eye post would realized I referring brought smaller size workforce
When number job boom advent personal computer wonder young people growing computer boom along
You know
I believe age determining factor skill programmer
And quite aptly proved age also factor determining someone oversensitive jerk
That fact IT requires someone well within top mental cognitive ability ability peak age begin show measurable decline
Personally I believe advantage come age experience offset loses certain role point catch
It whether forgotten whipper snapper ever learned whether remember readily recall utilize effecti Whaa
IT people typically well typical
Good computer scientist intelligent bunch IT professional computer scientist let alone good one
In experience half IT professional le intelligent average college graduate average collage graduate I recession ageism seemed working I young enough I work nearly year
Could I argue age worked
The market
It sucked
And top everything employer know good employee hole wall
Whoever lied best seemed get job
The
You seem overestimate many qualified people walk door
The vast majority candidate I see completely unqualified regardless resume degree may say
If I see someone walk door job well hired
Period end story
In professional environment room age discrimination
And good reason
Because rubber hit road project full swing need every hour work In many case team individual We always team individual interviewing
But help I wrote book current hiring process
Ok single document acted guideline
But beside point
I yet see team strongly divided candidate
Once worked together nail good interview process managed separate wheat chaff pretty quickly
To point question whether person competent
Either demonstrate ability handle coding general sense technology use ca
Of particular interest I throw candidate
I care long take get right ask question
I try make candidate comfortable possible go problem
We sketch whiteboard talk like real design session
From session I clearly see candidate work problem
I even reliably separate nerve lack capability
It help Fizz Buzz gotchas people trip
Tripping gotchas bad thing
In fact reveals candidate attempt create logically efficient code
I seen different solution I never failed given solution
What sit well may surprise
I like candidate attempt obfuscate code
Many write deliberately obscures logic
This often attempt hide lack knowledge
Others trouble correcting bug
If I point bug
You one loop
go screw part program STILL fix problem
Of course good candidate tend spot problem step logic
I explicitly point
Finally unwillingness try really tee
I happily answer question want
I even write large chunk code
But manage absolutely nothing good useless
You amazed many people survive conning others work
No one point disqualify candidate
But given enough opportunity sign start adding
Before know got pretty clear picture competency
Oh one thing I hate Do lie
Do tell got strong experience something done stand near someone used technology
The truth come pretty quickly get knocked roster
If candidate come short show promise I often recommend junior position
But lie
Getting back original point I felt really strongly particular candidate one else liked I probably enough credibility stored convince least trial period
But I thankfully never situation
It usually clear dump hire
The worst I ever seen candidate concern strength candidate communication skill
We still hired
currently trying piss away Misspending youth
The wine never sweet upon lip youth
Outstanding advice
I went back career network engineering information security though I went back picked finance degree
make valuable addition
You going find awkward especially prof age even younger
Some suggestion I make
BE HUMBLE even alpha play one
set aside adopt alternate persona
classmate want hear experience ready reject show sign
instead humility friend
kick as assignment show naturally good thing younger classmate likely respect
always keep humility persona
going intimidated age difference find year age difference really mean jack cool

HANDLE PROFS CAREFULLY show creativity innovativness eagerness etc
DOING saying
screw many nontraditional student
yes important let prof know eager
showing
understand outlier every subtle action make classroom effect
piss classmate make prof uncomfortable

FIND YOUR PERSONA AND STICK TO IT dad faculty university good amount nontraditional student
learned even faculty stereotype nontrads
eager beaver volunteer everything desperate show worth low self esteem type total poseur flunk suck first try play prof like give preference typically gal take one class blow damn curve cuz freaking life outside one class usually nontrads come back academic world clingy trying prove worth self prof dominators nontrads want give input everything dominate discussion share worldly experience everything embarrass everyone room except
Those good choice
Find something subtle quiet driven
Sit front row kick as let work show drive
Let prof call get stuff right
They balance dialog keep seen hey work good game

FRIENDSHIPS Be open kind friendly
I ended friend spanning total range girl jock geek hard core achiever
All I smile relaxed damn good team player
It weird situation handle right rewarding degree open ton door
Good luck
In experience considerable I oooold wo age problem
That old enough trigger insurance company really mess company expense keeping around current insurance setup
And know health care may look somewhat different
A lot ageism tech company willing pay experience older employee usually brings table fresh school apply
It seems odds ok
He also accept starting wage course
The problem lot year old CS degree several year year experience like graduated year real experience
You like think lumped age make people want lump experienced people
He need find good mentor take real learning quickly school really teach work real world
The faster catch age bracket better
Is old
No I almost far best developer area large company
The people I see squeezed one upward aspiration plenty time make good degree
The people I see squeezed one upward aspiration That actually give advantage since wo moping around like younger one company fails satisfy aspiration
When come experience trump degree anyday Let face A degree mean taught thing work
Real world experience teach thing work
The way get real world experience
If experience want degree degree worth
However please wave degree around saying I degree trump every time
It going work way
Now degree experience equal footing let best person win
If place look degree chance missing talented people field
In year I received job offer every job I interviewed without kind degree unless count real world experience
I lucky I able pick job I wanted thing I want
I work field I chosen hobby well aptitude interest
It fun go work day learning experience even day fun
The post great except one line If currently field asking get degree go position call
You probably need degree break even
If worth starting scratch go
If already programming employed getting degree reinforce know good idea help salary
On hand already programming wasting time
Programmers mostly like writer artist
You ca help
You get sucked even fight
If get sucked crappy programmer get college matter good education get already proven core programmer
You handed test failed
LUCKY YOU REALLY
Furthermore year old usually life
year old
You really need something hour get fantastic
year old accomplish three year
A year old wife family wo accomplish decade
What DID get sucked
What spend
Dig time figure loved
Do THAT
You good
If programmer wo get hired year old programmer old BAD
If fail first question get fail second
Set succeed fail
I disagree post almost entirety
There plenty great actor director writer painter etcetera get involved profession became famous later life blatant example Grandma Moses started painting generation dead
Some people choose young adult job need make living circumstance force simply never exposure something later discover wrong type exposure
There many reason someone passion something pursue later life
Even I grant hour right number hour year job
I say line pretty closely personal experience I switched CS major two half year left math studio art felt extremely solid first three year job
Programming mystical magical skill I would call creative job either one better paying job IT
People university degree CS usually stay programmer long tend go university get responsible higher paying job
The reason mostly done young people generally still living year something probably went wrong career advancement
Anyway OP even mention programming showed interest IT
In experience year old project manager analyst architect even quite talented trouble getting taken seriously getting people listen year old
Ageism exists yes
If adult still kid job people wonder went wrong
If kid adult job trouble getting taken seriously
What programming actually want
Some people actually choose profession want highest yield dollar per effort
And people get opportunity actually pursue career little later life
Sometimes fault mistake know making time
And sometimes matter life happening adjusting priority u
The OP mention programming
Of course people get programming job enjoy still living year probably enjoy
Do kind logic experience support statement
Hey I really love programming I year guess time switch something I enjoy like project management
unless plan birth programmer screwed
I think someone think highly profession
unreasonable age begin second unrelated career almost anything
I would also submit attending school good even end following path professional
I ca tell number people life degree What load BS
CS nothing programming
Code end result
No autodidact person I ever met understood NP complete problem
Also experience smartest CS person I know woke one morning realized stuck dead beat job promotion path
He quit job took math summer course started studying CS proper kind graduated last year currently applying multiple company offering high payed job The first computer company I worked unusual
I ha And probably would even get job assuming I could find anyone want hire engineer early
But I care I enjoyment satisfaction
I quit day job December I hoping ever day job working
I much happier I trying entrepreneurial thing even though I yet bringing much income I got day job
When I late early I found experience much factor getting hired getting good salary degree
I sure exception employer idiot would want work employer anyhow
For anyone degree AND industry experience I recommend getting degree summer internship get experience
When I involved interviewing candidate I found even candidate MSCS real experience often adequately prepared software developer position
CS program tend heavy theory nothing wrong almost entirely lacking practice
I making twice average salary discipline DBA
My goal year move triple
Going school give piece paper
So getting certification
No big deal
Rote memorization answer without comprhension answer correct get piece paper
You need ask two question If working improving skill knowledge expanding exp While certainly smell like shit I seen cat food made I got say probably hell lot healthier shit I eat
I seen opposite come age programmer
People grown tired young whippersnapper fresh outa college executable UML agile methodology
Where I experience especially plain familiarity software real world acedemic fantasy land
Someone year dev experience pure gold company fight tooth nail recruit old veteran assuming ar consulting serious money
Now obviously apply experience age employer looking I ca see company turning based unless plan working year
Even though may programming probably going social team skill people coming school
Just ability communicate idea massive skill seem taught
I think I make taco dinner hav
And I need get hair cut starting look like hippy
Some company want younger people cheap work extra hour USB key pizza something
If skill useful company want someone useful
Most company shit run fucking idiot suit anyway
Do worry
I agree completely
I programmer I high level engineering group system design mostly
At I youngest group seven engineer
The caveat experienced field high level group start
Our entry level position populated mostly late early
It worth noting invented agile methodology coinventor extreme programming
No generally known worth noting professional developer since least late eighty
I guess late
coinventor extreme programming inventor wiki
year old
coinventor Tell get grass
Do confidence ability learn
Will stick four year commitment
You need answer question honestly head road
The question opportunity like get
going depend part four year
You might consider trying get company might need skill later
It easier move around within company get foot door
Guarantee included
I pushing year
Been programming life
Never completed CS degree
Worked fairly high profile project NYC Chicago San Francisco
I would say tho point life I definitely level I apply job would Director position probably small startup
I know friend consulting company guy
Other friend work big software company similar age group
In end good programmer problem
But point going probably start company level schoole coder
I would worry ageism thing
I I software engineer since I around started way get first real job
Since highest title I reached Software Engineer I pretty much career
Never interest management Lead anything would take trench coding
This also mean salary capped I live around thereabouts
I strange idea experience naysayer
You could listen forever paralyzed always nothing
So rule thumb
There always exception work exception
The shelf library littered biography successful people almost none achieved book ideal life pedigree grade
Perhaps something like Napoleon Hill Lessons Success may inspiring read although understand I think I story get much content
Look way
With year retirement ON AN OPTIMISTIC note assuming SS forced everyone work till birthday
Do want
Invest hour get good stop regret
Having read numerous time take hour get world class great something I convinced many great people one started young one without responsibility time
Not youth alone
So late start stick
You find may managing younger competitor
While throw business management course help ensure positioned mature industry
It depends work
In many shop become increasing clear want hire anyone though without experience right kid
The sad truth many grad last year junk
Not people fortunately career still attracts great crowd curriculum create people think compiler runtime OS black box
They rather literally think term South Park gnome
Step write code Step Profit
And mindless dependence creates people idea code work often
That fine school ca ship product writing code like mean turned legion coder fit writing report accounting instead firmware engine controller new comm protocol
And even work penalty failure accounting report low
On meaningful project assigning work generation like building bug bug take loooong time fix team simply understand machine really
Not worry still plenty business basically idea software sausage made merrily hire anyone degree business experience line exact opposite true
They want previous generation coder use CS grad tech support lucky apprentice
Honestly I worked guy relatively new IT
I never heard ageism experience
Hell fact posted Slashdot probably enough reason hire
I say go
Consider live generation probably live
And likely work till
You year want earn enough money support following year
I going back Geology
I probably finish I still year work
My motivation I see career Electronics able warm retirement
You either nothing
But I see Geology something take smaller job slow retirement
From I see much broader Electronics
Hey rainbow
When say pissed away something got know part world kid went straight college IT generally ignorant
Years ago I could say I work computer meant something
Now say I work computer merely mean job
They everything
For business computer end tool
Nobody hire somebody degree hammer
But learned special sort carpentry demonstrate ability know swing hammer well
That say want study tool even get degree
But focus craft love build people really get hired tool collection
Not except truly hack work
Anyway gotten know part world well pissing away year leverage
Have seen aspect life improved right computer tech
If start studying
Make niche
Take advantage already uniquely
It strength
I know Computer Science class really prepare IT one developing application writing code managing computer
Many many people IT position even bachelor degree associate often le gone trade college done studying gotten MSCEs certification
If heart computer science go
Go college year write lot code really many place interviewing position bachelor candidate ask many line code written really understand CS couple key langagues paradigm
OOP REST whatever teaching
I older worry much
Again IT different know IT year look compared IT today
I think old entry level position key concern age desire ability work
Few people wife kid associated lifestyle influence prevent regularly working hour day
People late manner excuse distraction may deal entry level position
My father made observation Old doctor old lawyer like old wine
Old engineer like old fish fillet
There probably outright although I smack face yet
But I suspect much common desire latest shiny technology
When I went school Java invented yet class taught Pascal
The college presumably teaching new cool stuff
So fresh degree
As I would advise college student considering computer career I recommend project side much
Find project learn way around contribute line code
Figure college teaching study
For example school teach Java get assembly language C programming study
Joel writes say wo hire anyone know work pointer may extreme case knowing pointer help
Study want ad try figure employer looking make sure learning
But ca learn everything
I Visual Basic experience I never interested job require
So I guess I saying try figure area would like qualified get skill
I highly recommend study Python good book walk whole language expose cool stuff
Other people would urge study LISP stretch mind bit
When I playing LISP I used book The Little Schemer DrScheme environment run code
The point last paragraph make stand bit degree
You wo fresh degree also able write cool Python script juggle C pointer maybe write LISP function
I believe sort extra help someone decide hire
If work full time support family going school night going hard
I friend right sometimes homework midnight get go work
He probably ten year older I sure
The good news really right computer software career right actually enjoy lot work
Building software project watching actually start work special pleasure
steveha I
I managed grocery store early
I got degree
While school I quit grocery business went work Comp USA Yeah yeah I hated place
Started sale weasel opening Tech dept repair service
When I got degree I year IT yeah yeah Comp USA IT go together
belt got job University IT department Help Desk Service Coordinator one man complaint department
I got job dual ability able manage people grocery business manager I understood technology repair bench experience
I hated every minute got door
One responsibility position work different IT department constantly bickering whose job take care given situation
I earned reputation someone could troubleshoot AND get thing done
When position opened admin I jumped got job
So year getting degree I manage window admins unix admins mainframe admins DBA University
Yes
Now bad part
In order I went extreme debt paying school working peanut Comp USA
It took year pay debt I accumulated getting I make decent living
It lot hardship lot dedication luck landing position
If ready take step good luck
I last year found environment people mid younger
They clue
They good programmer genius level social skill teamwork sucked big time
Furthermore agile programming
The lack planning project caused massive support problem
This may OK early iteration product starting show major tech support problem
Once shipped product even work tested thoroughly
What drove away lack plan clear set performance standard
I never really knew I hired I way knowing well I I strong sense fitting falling expectation even though nobody stated expectation
Somewhere occurred guy took granted elemental programming concept generation invent back
None could assembly none knew manage decision table idea formal system analysis foreign
My computer game chess I take system order get work done guy think game WoW
I suggest decide want
To CS designing hardware structure
CIS designing administration apps make structure work MIS design apps produce tangible result especially specific
These definition necessarily match college teaching name
In experience MIS environment little respect age experience CS high regard innovation result
Good luck

I admit MS
Still I wouldnt change
Storm hiring
Some company hire young people know They married yet willing work extra hour extra pay
spouse child need home
They willing work le le experience year old company hire average salary
Management know younger people handle stress older people work younger people harder
A younger person le likely need benefit skip insurance benefit help save company money
In reality company run scumbags dirtbags better working
They cause get sicker eventually become like get sick work end disability
If hire average salary minimum benefit lot overtime extra pay bonus
What need research company applying search Internet feedback see run dirtbags scumbags
There used web site named I think people resort writing blog forum employer
But others exist see company want apply people complaining
For older people always get contract right hire opportunity start six month one year contract work good enough hire employee
You might like working contractor instead employee might earn pay fund health insurance donate IRA
Another option start small business
Go community college learn run small business continuing education department learn Quickbooks Turbo Tax filing accounting tax paper
I switched career programmer late strength community college certificate program I never even finished
The key enthusiasm
I done futzing around programming home whatever equivalent aspect IT interested make appropriate substitution barking wrong tree
One thing help early attempt getting job expressing want job want programming
If want programming already
If good enough actor fake enthusiasm go Hollywood need waste time code monkey
My first job internship I drove cab night
It even programming job data entry job
The data entry system sucked donkey ball I rewrote fast enough make lost time still finish project ahead schedule
That look good resume
If kind thing see fun see crap know better probably well
My current job I got partly strength recommendation one young hotshot already working
He gone community college time I noticed helping others lab told bos interview
Enthusiasm
So first criterion really want programming
If age wo matter
If age wo matter much
You explaining starting late life calling experience skill enthusiasm overcome doubt
This business young hotshot cowboy coder anymore business big money line
Companies want people produce produce beautiful code code sell
At age one advantage young whippersnapper experience providing business value work
We experience gaining using experience
What lack drama might make consistency reliability
But expect easy
The first year suck
The pay hour working condition suck
And unless already written kind software product spare time code suck
You starting scratch better worse kid fresh college position bottom every totem pole like year old mortgage car payment kid feed
Keep use experience already experience gain every day
If really want thrill learning mastering new skill carry
You prove like anyone starting scratch try kid prove reliable professional
It harder break kind business advanced age difficulty come different expectation flexibility stamen ability predjudice part working
I pushing I find many people including employer assume experience chosen field age alone even seen resume
If choice position come youth college age huge advantage
A lot employer look maturity intellect first raw skill second
And anyway never case resume get job although might limit position
Either strong recommendation excellent interview get job
And spend next year boning
whatever want interview easier think
You say wasted twenty
I think struggle age hiring process especially position
Potential employer wonder type person waste twenty ask want hire sort person
You need explanation past decade put positive light even circumstance bad
However manage squeeze career solid relevant experience get past
I good friend exactly describing
We actually met CS program college
He IT manager well
One thing well take previous work experience leverage useful way IT
I say go
Not mention extremely expensive little real pay
Colleges become diploma mill go get Real Good Jobs R future
They becoming le le place new idea born old idea challenged
Not mention extremely expensive little real pay
Pure BS
I dispute school worth shit I working second Bachelor Computer Science like poster I would trade anything
I graduating pretty soon
Here thing I noticed first time around Philosophy major
Take average community college say Harvard
Have look typical philosophy class
Say Critique Pure Reason Platonic dialog
Same
Fucking
Books
So set apart
Well quality professor right
But gap big think
Assuming get PhD teaching class got someone point quite lot time becoming expert subject
Not mention attitude matter anyhow
Any sufficiently motivated student good experience matter professor
I say classically horrible experience
I also supplemented experience watching CS lecture MIT OpenCourseWare
I would say general guy perhaps better computer scientist whether better teacher question
So reinforces opinion
The bottom line go back school love subject
If think computer cool want know go
Computer science experience first degree
This time I bit mature homework always get done shit I paying degree pocket I better make best
At work CS knowledge greatly expanded capability enjoyment job
School another investment
Yes
If care money I news people like going beat job every time
You care part money hey probably beat pay part
We better work like work
People hobby
Some people like fish
Some like muscle car
Others like spend time bar shooting shit
Me
I like change perception world
Try sometime
He likely get managerial role relatively quickly anyway
Unless spent last ten year coma mature people skill
It something easily shortcut
Education substitute experience
Remember ISA card IRQ setting COM v problem work around
Kids today
They depend PnP magically make work
Quoted truth
I remember stuff I really miss I
Had fiddle around kind problem making different variation get various software even working back I aged
Would MSDOS
But I reckon I youngest group people hack around bit command line deal kind stuff even I guru compared year older
I I guy said Education substitute experience
Remember ISA card IRQ setting COM v problem work around
Kids today
They depend PnP magically make work
A lot hiring monkey get true
Show kid build network using printer cable DOS hack get something work WindowsXP
These quite possibly example experience could listed
Those skill obsolete making fire flint stone starting car engine hand crank feeding program mainframe punch card
Which say sure specialty application technology still might find use
But overall reason nobody care simply world moved
True experience mastery technology improved judgment stem able analyze situation relate similar problem encountered past turn help find better solution
If start community college TRANSFER Yale Harvard Stanford better
A big name help lot paycheck
At think better going doctoral program assuming SOME degree interest pay little could wash year half two year master degree little debt
Thus spake master programmer When learned snatch error code trap frame time leave
Book Verse
One problem older programmer cling archaic concept like old favorite programming language C Assembler Fortran
They worship shrine old pantheon Wirth Venn Turing
They grasp modern subtlety modular beauty DirectX without deliberate effort
They think security absolute virtue cleansing input trusting noone considering pathological condition
Pity
They understand beauty rapidly advancing user interface end user little understanding underlying technology create vast perfect representation vision whole thing seizes save like Visio diagram
That computer science cruel perfect
If geezer get understand thing done day
They lost touch course modern progress
They never able code word processor app consumes processor power quad core gig RAM
They never get automatically executing code attached word processing document essential feature
They know never know old
Pity

If Microsoft Project filter meet need identifying incomplete late slipped task try custom Behind Schedule filter
By When managing project schedule even moderate size valuable able quickly identify late task without scrolling large hierarchy task
In Microsoft Project identify incomplete late slipped task using one option These filter nice I usually need filter different set criterion view data I like see
So I decided create custom filter Microsoft Project would identify late task
My original approach identify late task filtering Complete field Baseline Finish date Resource name column
I followed step
Select Tracking Gantt View using Entry Table

Insert Baseline Start Baseline Finish

Confirm Complete column view
This approach worked generate list late task project status review however I switched view needed additional information I remove filter rebuild minute later
This process quickly became tiresome simply view late task
The need quick reusable filter identify task behind schedule led create custom filter I named Behind Schedule
You create custom Behind Schedule filter following step
Select Project Filter For More Filters click New

Enter Behind Schedule Name field

Click first row Field Name select Baseline Finish field

Enter le equal test condition

Click second row select Complete field

Select equal Test condition enter value Value column
To clear filter click All Tasks Filter combo box project task display
In order filter work need baseline gasp project schedule
If project team hesitant baseline entire schedule apply rolling planning approach baseline task next phase major milestone
The Behind Schedule filter identifies task incomplete exceeded baseline finish date
I encourage also look Slipping Tasks Slipped Progress identify task impacted start date
You create additional filter based criterion following step outlined tutorial
If trouble building filter want add Behind Schedule filter project
Do specific filter Microsoft Project customization frequently use
If tell u discussion

The early start early finish late start late finish date project schedule primary date calculated project schedule
The early start date project schedule earliest activity schedule scheduled start given logic constraint schedule
The early finish activity schedule earliest activity scheduled completed given logic constraint schedule
The late start activity latest project activity scheduled started without reschedule calculated early finish project
The late finish activity latest project activity finished without reschedule late finish project
The late finish project late finish last activity completed project
The schedule made early start early finish activity schedule called early schedule
The schedule made late start late finish activity schedule called late schedule
The early start project declared first
Unless least one date tell project begin end possible know schedule relative activity
Normally want know project schedule relevant real calendar day specific period time
All activity predecessor must declared start date
In project management software available today information entered project start date used activity predecessor
Most software also allows calculation schedule using declared project finish date well
For discussion let u say declaring date start project
Once declared beginning project say early start activity without least one predecessor early start equal declared project start date
By convention agreement scheduler assumed project schedule work always begin beginning work period activity start always end end work period activity end
This mean activity scheduled day basis true project work activity scheduled start morning day scheduled start finish afternoon day finished
This mean activity duration would start morning Monday January finish afternoon Monday January
An activity duration start January finish January
This creates confusion since many people would expect difference early start early finish activity equal duration case
The early finish activity early start activity plus duration minus one
In case early schedule early start successor activity beginning next time period completion preceding activity
If activity finish January predecessor another activity successor activity scheduled start January
Notice early schedule successor activity one predecessor early start successor activity calculated time period following latest predecessor early finish
The early finish date activity calculated taking early finish date activity adding duration
When done care must taken ensure duration added early start date weekend holiday nonworking day also added calculate early finish date
The late finish date must way getting started well
In case project schedule late finish project set equal early finish latest early finish date activity project
Every activity project schedule successor given date late finish
If five activity activity logically following successor would late finish equal early finish last activity completed early schedule
To get late start activity must subtract duration late finish activity
Again calculation early schedule care must taken include weekend holiday nonworking day
As calculation early schedule must careful adjust scheduled late start date convention activity start morning day start finish afternoon date finish
This mean activity late finish date January duration three day late start date January
In case late schedule late finish predecessor activity end last time period succeeding activity scheduled start
If activity scheduled late start February predecessor must completed later February order allow start scheduled
Notice late schedule successor activity one predecessor late finish predecessor activity calculated time period late start successor late start
This say activity finish later date necessary support late start successor

Bit smallest piece information computer understand either hold
Computers rely Binary
Why
Lets think processor made
Yeah got right
Gates gate lot
Transistors mother gate
Now Typically lame fashion say processor fancy way saying collection billion transistor stuff I ask
Also every fancy complex instruction application run end day done series gate inside processor
So coming another part story Electricity Lets forget mechanical computer existed least
You got feed electricity gate live
Say simple add seems
Yeah got transistor brain Image Source So gate know
Yeah giving positive voltage
voltage
On Off
So get volt volt volt answer
thank work prove Boolean algebra done electric switch relay Yeah somewhat high level thing work inside processor
Data stored data address pointing data chip
So Just View Bit
abstraction view Bits
This per calculator application
part image part video anything
Cause application tend view data
PS It also represent Thank You
Split bit convert ascii Feel free use P A bit smallest amount data computer file ultimately made
A bit zero one
bit form one byte

The string bit making byte processed unit computer byte smallest operable unit storage computer
A byte represent equivalent single character letter B comma percentage sign represent number
Because byte contains little information processing storage capacity computer hardware usually given gigabyte GB one billion byte terabyte TB one trillion byte
Because byte root binary digit originally one kilobyte byte byte thus one megabyte MB byte
However notable exception computer industry switched decimal prefix prefix denote thousandfold increase byte
bit called byte
group called byte
Because digital computer use byte ASCII code commonly embedded field consisting seven information bit parity bit used purpose represent special symbol
The use system device processing storing displaying information
meant person computation term almost universally refers automated electronic machinery
code used digital computer based binary number system two possible state usually symbolized
Whereas decimal system employ digit digit position represents power etc
communication information theory unit information equivalent result choice two possible alternative binary number system generally used digital computer

The used digital
A binary digit one two may physically represented device
These state value commonly represented either
The two value binary digit also interpreted algebraic activation state attribute
The correspondence value physical state underlying matter convention different assignment may used even within device
The length binary number may referred
In one bit typically defined binary random variable equal probability information gained value variable becomes known
In exist two bit value
The symbol binary digit either simply recommended standard lowercase recommended standard
A group eight binary digit commonly called one historically size byte strictly defined
As bit alternatively called named founder field information theory
This usage distinguishes quantity information form state variable used represent
When logical value equally probable signal conveyed perfectly communication system binary digit representation information convey le one bit information
However shannon unit terminology uncommon practice
The encoding data discrete bit used invented Falcon developed later adopted early computer manufacturer like
Another variant idea perforated
In system medium card tape conceptually carried array hole position position could either punched thus carrying one bit information
The encoding text bit also used early digital communication machine
suggested use logarithmic measure information first used word seminal paper
He attributed origin written Bell Labs memo January contracted binary information digit simply bit
Interestingly written bit information could stored used mechanical computer time
The first programmable computer built used binary notation number
A bit stored digital device physical system exists either two possible distinct
These may two stable state two position two distinct level allowed two distinct level two direction orientation reversible double stranded etc
Bits implemented several form
In modern computing device bit usually represented pulse electrical state
For device using digit value logical value true represented positive voltage relative representation
The specific voltage different different logic family variation permitted allow component aging noise immunity
For example TTL compatible circuit digit value output device represented higher volt lower volt respectively TTL input specified recognize volt volt
Bits transmitted one time multiple number bit
A optionally process bit one time
Data transfer rate usually measured decimal SI multiple unit
In earliest information processing device Jacquard loom Babbage bit often stored position mechanical lever gear presence absence hole specific point
The first electrical device discrete logic control circuit Konrad Zuse computer represented bit state could either open closed
When relay replaced starting computer builder experimented variety storage method pressure pulse traveling charge stored inside surface opaque spot printed technique
In method largely supplanted device bit represented polarity certain area film change polarity one direction
The principle later used developed still found various item ticket
In modern two value bit may represented two level stored
In certain type bit may represented presence absence conducting path certain point circuit
In bit encoded presence absence microscopic pit reflective surface
In bit encoded thickness alternating black white line
The bit defined SI
However issued standard specifies symbol binary digit used multiple kilobit
However letter b widely used well recommended
In contrast upper case letter B standard customary symbol byte
Multiple bit may expressed represented several way
For convenience representing commonly reoccurring group bit information technology several traditionally used
The common unit coined June historically used represent group bit used encode single text multibyte encoding took computer reason used basic element many
The trend hardware design converged common implementation using eight bit per byte widely used today
However ambiguity relying underlying hardware design unit defined explicitly denote sequence eight bit
Computers usually manipulate bit group fixed size conventionally named

When information capacity storage system communication channel presented often refers binary digit capacity store binary data current etc
Information capacity storage system upper bound quantity information stored therein
If two possible value one bit storage equally likely bit storage contains le one bit information
Indeed value completely predictable reading value provides information zero entropic bit resolution uncertainty occurs therefore information available
If computer file us bit storage contains bit information information principle encoded bit least average
This principle basis technology
Using analogy hardware binary digit refer amount storage space available like number bucket available store thing information content filling come different level granularity fine coarse compressed uncompressed information
When granularity information bucket hold
For example estimated combined technological capacity world store information provides hardware digit
However storage space filled corresponding content optimally compressed represents information
When optimally compressed resulting carrying capacity approach
Certain computer instruction operate level manipulating bit rather manipulating data interpreted aggregate bit

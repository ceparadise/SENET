A OOP associated
An object mostly made data behavior form interface object present outside world
Data represented object behavior method
For example object would method state whether opened closed would property
In method defined object instance given class
One important capability method provides method overriding
The name used multiple different kind class
This allows sending object invoke behavior delegate implementation behavior receiving object
A method Java programming set behavior class object
For example object send message another object appropriate formula invoked whether receiving object etc
Methods also provide interface class use access modify data object
This known encapsulation
Encapsulation overriding two primary distinguishing feature method procedure call
overloading two significant way method differs conventional procedure function call
Overriding refers subclass redefining implementation method superclass
For example may method defined shape class
The various subclass etc
would define appropriate formula calculate area
The idea look object black box change internals object made minimal impact object use
This known encapsulation meant make code easier maintain
Method overloading hand refers differentiating code used handle message based parameter method
If one view receiving object first parameter method overriding special case overloading selection based first argument
The following simple example illustrates difference Accessor method used read data value object
Mutator method used modify data object
Manager method used initialize destroy object class
constructor destructors
These method provide facilitates
For example class provides accessor method retrieve current rather directly accessing balance data field later code implement complex mechanism balance retrieval fetch without dependent code needing changed
The concept encapsulation modularity unique programming
Indeed many way approach simply logical extension previous paradigm
A method called beginning object lifetime create initialize object process called
Initialization may include acquisition resource
Constructors may parameter usually return value language
See following example Java A method called automatically end object lifetime process called
Destruction language allow destructor method argument return value
Destruction implemented perform cleanup chore task object destruction
In language destructors known
They similar purpose function destructors difference language utilize language manual memory management sequence called different
An one
It often used specify subclass must provide implementation method
Abstract method used specify computer language
The following code show abstract class need extended The following subclass extends main class Class method method called rather instance
They typically used part object
class defined instance class object created
allow class created deleted
In sense provide functionality constructor destructors described
But language allows developer dynamically alter object model run time create new class redefine class hierarchy modify property etc
Special method language may support none special method defined
A language compiler may automatically generate default special method programmer may allowed optionally define special method
Most special method directly called rather compiler generates code call appropriate time
Static method meant relevant instance class rather specific instance
They similar static variable sense
An example would static method sum value variable every instance class
For example class might static method compute average price product
In Java commonly used static method This static method owning object run instance
It receives information argument
A static method invoked even instance class exist yet
Static method called static resolved compile time based class called dynamically case instance method resolved polymorphically based runtime type object
operator define action performed compiler class object assigned class object type
Operator method define operation performed symbol associated method parameter
Example Some procedural language extended capability leverage large skill set legacy code language still provide benefit development
Perhaps example extension programming language
Due design requirement add paradigm existing procedural language message passing unique capability terminology
For example method known
also concept member function allow
mean class achieve polymorphic behavior
participate

I argument usage word accessor context Java programming
I tend think accessors implicitly property accessors term implies le provide direct access object internal state
The party insists method touch object state way accessor
I know guy ca win argument I curious know would define term
By accessors I tend think getters setter
By insisting method touch object internal state accessors seems instance method actually us state object would accessor seem right
What kind instance method wo use state object
In word
For example method considered accessor
It method read value instance method called return result adding value another
It seems fairly straight forward instance method getter setter
An accessor method exactly say tin access state type without side effect apart lazy instantiation perhaps something caller would normally know
Methods modify state usefully considered opinion mutators
Besides googling wikipedia show example accessor method So yes I say get value field
The compiler may inline converting simple read anything probably accessor
getRed getGreen getBlue These method usually access value
setRed setGreen setBlue A mutator mutate value I always gone first definition
So generally applies getters setter
If go second method far le useful distinction since cover almost method
Accessor method used access field object
So getters setter accessor method
right term method make general observation object without causing externally observable side effect
A method whose primary purpose cause side effect
Therefore setter mutator method
For good engineering practice public setter avoided make impossible class enforce invariant data violate abstraction barrier class ordinarily enforce
It good able differentiate getters setter technical conversation
method partner method
read state object write state
A method provides access access access internals object method
The author certainly us manner I think term may originate Common Lisp everything
setf used modify value accessor slot

There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine

In computer programming accessor method method fetch private data stored within object
An accessor provides mean obtain state object program part
This preferred method paradigm provides abstraction layer hide implementation detail functionality set
While new dependent code contained within accessor method directly access state data
Also within database fetch dependent code need changed
This advantage type programming
When comparing two data item two access method call necessary order make comparison
Accessors seek underlying data data creation data retrieval initialization retrieval modification
The accessor method type instance method contains sequence programming statement purpose performing action customizing action parameter producing return value sort

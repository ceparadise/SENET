discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Information system specialist focus integrating information technology solution business process meet information need business enterprise enabling achieve objective effective efficient way
This discipline perspective information technology emphasizes information view technology instrument generating processing distributing information
Professionals discipline primarily concerned information computer system provide aid enterprise defining achieving goal process enterprise implement improve using information technology
A majority Information Systems IS program located business school
All IS degree combine business computing coursework
A variety IS program exist various label often reflect nature program
For example program Computer Information Systems usually strongest technology focus program Management Information Systems emphasize organizational behavioral aspect IS
Degree program name always consistent
A fourth area campus New Media computing discipline rather overlap computing user computer technology The New Media Program University Maine offer interdisciplinary course study system technology history design theory information
The curriculum enables student investigate creative applied process essential area study
It prepares student technologically capable articulate thinker creative medium professional
UMaine New Media Web site There confusion another area computing information technology
Note information technology IT differs meaning term used UMaine Strategic Plan author essentially mean The ACM IEEE differentiate IS IT follows
Whereas perspective IS emphasizes information technology viewed instrument generating processing distributing information Information Technology emphasize technology information conveys
IT new rapidly growing field started grassroots response practical everyday need business organization
Today organization every kind dependent information technology

In system determines transaction integrity visible user system
For example user creating Purchase Order created header Purchase Order line header available carrying operation report Purchase Orders see
A lower isolation level increase ability many user access data time increase number concurrency effect dirty read lost update user might encounter
Conversely higher isolation level reduces type concurrency effect user may encounter requires system resource increase chance one transaction block another
Isolation typically defined database level property defines change made one operation become visible
On older system may implemented systemically example use temporary table
In system Transaction Processing TP manager required maintain isolation
In system multiple website attempting book last seat flight combination stored procedure transaction management required commit booking send confirmation customer
Isolation one Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability property
comprises underlying mechanism handle isolation guarantee related correctness
It heavily used database storage engine see guarantee correct execution concurrent transaction different mechanism correctness DBMS process
The mechanism typically constrain database data access operation timing certain order characterized schedule property
Constraining database access operation execution typically mean reduced performance rate execution thus concurrency control mechanism typically designed provide best performance possible constraint
Often possible without harming correctness serializability property compromised better performance
However recoverability compromised since typically result quick database integrity violation
common transaction concurrency control method DBMSs used provide serializability recoverability correctness
In order access database object transaction first need acquire object
Depending access operation type reading writing object lock type acquiring lock may blocked postponed another transaction holding lock object
Of four property Database Management System isolation property one often relaxed
When attempting maintain highest level isolation DBMS usually acquires data may result loss implement control
This requires adding logic function correctly
Most DBMSs offer number control degree locking occurs selecting data
For many database application majority database transaction constructed avoid requiring high isolation level
SERIALIZABLE level thus reducing locking overhead system
The programmer must carefully analyze database access code ensure relaxation isolation cause software bug difficult find
Conversely higher isolation level used possibility increased also requires careful analysis programming technique avoid
The isolation level defined standard listed follows
This isolation level
With DBMS implementation requires read write lock acquired selected data released end transaction
Also must acquired query us ranged clause especially avoid phenomenon
When using based concurrency control lock acquired however system detects among several concurrent transaction one allowed commit
See detail topic
From Second Informal Review Draft Database Language July In isolation level DBMS implementation keep read write lock acquired selected data end transaction
However managed occur
Write skew possible isolation level phenomenon two writes allowed column table two different writer previously read column updating resulting column data mix two transaction
In isolation level DBMS implementation keep write lock acquired selected data end transaction read lock released soon operation performed occur isolation level
As previous level managed
Putting simpler word read committed isolation level guarantee data read committed moment read
It simply restricts reader seeing intermediate uncommitted read
It make promise whatsoever transaction read find data data free change read
This isolation level
In level allowed one transaction may see change made transaction
Since isolation level stronger higher isolation level allows action forbidden lower one standard permit DBMS run transaction isolation level stronger requested Read committed transaction may actually performed Repeatable read isolation level
The different varies quite widely
Most database feature transaction allow user set isolation level
Some DBMS also require additional syntax performing SELECT statement acquire lock
acquire exclusive write lock accessed row
However definition criticized ambiguous accurately reflecting isolation provided many database There also criticism concerning ANSI SQL isolation definition encourages implementors bad thing The standard SQL refers three different Transaction read data Transaction might changed
In following example two transaction take place
In first Query performed
Then second transaction Query performed committed
Finally first transaction Query performed
The query use following data table A aka occurs transaction allowed read data row modified another running transaction yet committed
Dirty read work similarly however second transaction would need committed first query return different result
The thing may prevented READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level update appearing order result earlier update always appear result set later update
In example Transaction change row commit change
Transaction read uncommitted data
Now Transaction roll back change already read Transaction update different change database view data may wrong record Transaction
But case row exists id age
A occurs course transaction row retrieved twice value within row differ read
phenomenon may occur concurrency control method read lock acquired performing acquired lock affected row released soon SELECT operation performed
Under method may occur requirement transaction affected must roll back relaxed
In example Transaction commits successfully mean change row id become visible
However Transaction already seen different value row
At SERIALIZABLE REPEATABLE READ isolation level DBMS must return old value second SELECT
At READ COMMITTED READ UNCOMMITTED DBMS may return updated value read
There two basic strategy used prevent read
The first delay execution Transaction Transaction committed rolled back
This method used locking used produce serial
A serial schedule exhibit behaviour
In strategy used Transaction permitted commit first provides better concurrency
However Transaction commenced prior Transaction must continue operate past version database snapshot moment started
When Transaction eventually try commit DBMS check result committing Transaction would equivalent schedule
If Transaction proceed
If seen equivalent however Transaction must roll back serialization failure
Using concurrency control method REPEATABLE READ isolation mode row ID would locked thus blocking Query first transaction committed rolled back
In READ COMMITTED mode second time Query executed age would changed
Under multiversion concurrency control SERIALIZABLE isolation level SELECT query see snapshot database taken start Transaction
Therefore return data
However Transaction attempted UPDATE row well serialization failure would occur Transaction would forced roll back
At READ COMMITTED isolation level query see snapshot database taken start query
Therefore see different data updated row
No serialization failure possible mode promise serializability made Transaction retried
A occurs course transaction new row added another transaction record read
This occur acquired performing operation
The anomaly special case Transaction repeat ranged query operation Transaction creates
new row target table fulfill clause
Note Transaction executed query twice
If highest level isolation maintained set row returned time indeed mandated occur database operating SQL SERIALIZABLE isolation level
However lesser isolation level different set row may returned second time
In SERIALIZABLE isolation mode Query would result record age range locked thus Query would block first transaction committed
In REPEATABLE READ mode range would locked allowing record inserted second execution Query include new row result
Anomaly Serializable Serializable
That necessary sufficient Serializable schedule free three phenomenon type

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

I beginner algorithm
Last year I participated Google Code Jam
One major issue I faced competition code working fine test case I submitted large number test case I failed pas causing logical error
So question basically I trace logical error code situation fails match test case
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
There easy way around
You look test case input one one situation think work manually correct answer see algorithm agrees
For example one thing bit recent Google Code Jam question I tried practice allocating big enough numeric type hold result
I using needed least bit
Looking difference long short test input I noticed much larger input value like purposely trying see I would overflow
That part contest
They want see well anticipate edge case
Otherwise would tell test case specifically failed
Another thing help writing test case see one failed submit
Try really large number really small one different combination positive negative etc
Try push boundary problem make sure cover angle
The trick make test case simple enough manually calculate also complex enough thorough test
That come practice
Although panacea may code inspection tool language help find errant behavior
For example testing tool application look code path creates series unit test using data exercise code path
You try web
And I discovered lightweight version Pex built Visual Studio extension
When I run code I success discovering edge case I failed account
I found exercise made better unit test author
Logical Issues solved logically test case may pas since specific data set designed written The best way make sure code fail logical sense take paper pencil write logical step data set mind go loop logical condition And coder testify system get embedded head code need write stuff automatically think logical consequence code write code
It always good idea begin code first write clear data description evaluating full scope data
The much easier get code work first time work data presented future
You also write program inspect validate incoming data
This good step make sure data think

I asked computer program Java deterministic
I wondering could
There thing Java program right
Even I use random number generator make branching unpredictable still really harder prove
This question came site professional academic student working within system development life cycle
I like expand jmite mention due threading
Is program deterministic
question might well asked parallel programming class answer many program often
In program exact interleaving instruction different thread
We ca order instruction interleaved using program input
To actually figure order instruction would interleave would require u know exact state cache branch predictor tlbs every core external interrupt occur picosecond mouse movement external network traffic timer interrupt exact position disk drive head respect spinning platter temperature every transistor least transistor drive asynchronous bus small fluctuation voltage coming wall socket battery
Given every time run multithreaded program exact instruction interleaving different really interested program exactly determined knowing input code
For example following multithreaded program This program sometimes print sometimes print
The following multithreaded program determinisitic This program would usually considered deterministic
It always print although know sequence value
Things get even interesting talking data structure like binary tree
In binary tree exact shape tree usually depends exact order node added
But often using binary tree represent abstract data type like ordered sequence many different tree shape represent abstract value
For example binary tree represent ordered sequence
So people would still call type although debug program thus deal different run different actual representation data structure might also call
You create true randomness computer using basis random number generator
So yes thing computational automaton
Even still computer
That make thing like Monte Carlo simulation possible
The quality randomness measured statistical technique
A would behave way time executed would behave manner consistent logical design
That given input multiple execution output always occur
This also true program employ number generator given seed user input program behave way time
Note way randomize number generator predict output
One common way take six least significant digit clock user press key use seed number generator
So problem
There two different competing meaning deterministic Computer Science
This defined contrast machine given state machine multiple possible taken
A machine accepts input exists accepting computation
Alternately view machine magic decision procedure tell action choose machine infinite parallelism try multiple option simultaneously
Real computer deterministic sense simulate usually sort backtracking search
Note NOT randomness occurring situation
Either assume magic choose path take assume trying parallel
In computing science something sense usually referred stochastic randomized
However term often used system programming describe threaded program
A program us random number inherently sense since output might change given input
However view random seed input view RNG input infinite stream number could argue program deterministic since output fixed given input
Things become complicated add threading
program output change depending thread scheduled
Mutexes semaphore etc
goal making multithreaded program deterministic
give result regardless thread scheduled
Which definition used depends context
If talking P
NP NP class problem solved Turing Machine first sense infinite parallelism
Likewise finite automaton NFAs first sense
A philosophical perhaps le useful answer given occurs accuracy measurement fall threshold required able sure outcome
The deterministic program listed
thing happening low enough level computer stack ca measure example measure right tool would normally expect part code development
There nothing actually event leading one gaining mutex another random measure thing affecting one win

Trace semantics defined various kind system notably different form branching probability
In paper claim identify one underlying mathematical structure behind trace semantics namely coinduction Kleisli category
This claim based technical result suitably setting final coalgebra Kleisli category given initial algebra category Sets
Formerly theory coalgebras employed mostly Sets coinduction yield finer process semantics bisimilarity
Therefore paper extends application field coalgebras providing new instance principle process semantics via coinduction

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
When testing complex example sometimes necessary test number condition time
A also called used record outcome test
The trace table simple example would look like A trace table might appear look similar without heading like outcome outcome

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

So functional override discrete mathematics
A feature I entirely sure critical system design
Say feature f fail g would override denoted x f x x I understand situation input within scope domain function supposed act override become function
But example notice outside domain
This seems unlikely realistic exception deal critical system one would expect capable compensating input recent examination kind question given I found quite trick question
If anyone could shed light would much appreciated None book mention anything handling kind input example taught always instance within least
So turn even g overriding f input outside range first overriding function output error never qualifies either test
Similarly try factorise negative number using calculator
By posting answer agree

The College Information Computer Sciences allows student met stated prerequisite meet eligibility requirement enroll course subject available seat
An override request essentially petition special permission enroll
Not request result enrollment depends course whether available seat
Enrollment number SPIRE always reflect true picture managing override request
DO NOT ASSUME THAT THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM IN A COURSE
Register early possible
BEFORE requesting override try enroll SPIRE
If enrollment successful NOT need override
If enroll SPIRE keep trying meet prereqs eligible
Students would allowed enroll SPIRE student may request override
Priority seat course CS Majors Applicants On Contract AOC CS Minors IT Minors Others
The CS Main Office working closely Undergraduate Program handle waitlists manually fairest way possible enrollment decision vary depending course
Some decision happen quickly others may take several week
Certain decision made group depending priority may made closer class start
We best give seat course given classroom size limitation
CS Majors use SPIRE enroll SPIRE Waitlists available
For others override request result seat ca enroll conflict credit overload contact adjust schedule
Please reply immediately let u know working problem
We save seat response result seat
Yes
We try give Five College student priority know ca arrange seat
All student request override via online form know interest making enrollment decision
We ca enroll Five College student arrange permission Registrar Offices via email
Yes
CPE student request override via online form know interest making enrollment decision
We ca enroll CPE student try communicate interest instructor CPE Registrar Office seat available
Yes
You also need complete Transfer Credit Evaluation TCE process CS prerequisite course vetted
It important attend early possible miss seat course fill
CS Majors enroll CS course SPIRE add SPIRE Waitlist available
In case student enroll still trying enroll equally qualified seat open keep override request list outside SPIRE

My intention use following sentence The administrator right user time slot venue A inside online system
So word would suitable override overwrite suitable word
Override cancellation previous action decision
Overwrite specifically refers something something previously written
In word overriden
overwritten
Furthermore overwritten
Therefore example overwrite appropriate The administrator right overwrite user time slot venue A inside online system
A similar example override would appropriate The administrator right override venue decision made online system
edit In context override could correct
Specifically consider following scenario
Say meeting already scheduled take place room
Then another employee change location room
In case administrator would decision rolling location back room
However equally correct say location room nothing original sentence imply scenario case
For reason I would say overwrite best word choice
To override take exercise power normal level regardless common rule
To overwrite replace
In case I would say override administrator using power system
That said still largely depends context around gave information I would able help
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site

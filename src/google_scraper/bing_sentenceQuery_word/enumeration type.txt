An complete ordered listing item collection
The term commonly used refer listing
The precise requirement enumeration example whether set must whether list allowed contain repetition depend discipline study context given problem
Some set enumerated mean set case may necessary impose perhaps arbitrary ordering
In context term used sense emphasis determination number element set contains rather production explicit listing element
In combinatorics enumeration mean determining exact number element finite set usually grouped infinite family family set consisting finite set
There flourishing subareas many branch mathematics concerned enumerating sense object special kind
For instance objective count partition graph meet certain condition
In notion enumeration broader sense require set enumerated finite
When enumeration used context impose sort ordering structure requirement index set
While make requirement ordering quite lax order allow great generality natural common prerequisite index set
According characterization ordered enumeration defined surjection onto relationship domain
This definition natural sense given index set provides unique way list next element given partial enumeration
The common use enumeration set theory occurs context infinite set separated countable
In case enumeration merely enumeration domain ω ordinal
This definition also stated follows We may also define differently working finite set
In case enumeration may defined follows In first definition varies whether mapping also required every element image natural number allowed mapping defined natural number
In application especially concerned computability set difference little importance one concerned mere existence enumeration enumeration according liberal definition generally imply enumeration satisfying stricter requirement also exist
Enumeration obviously requires either partiality accepted context finite set may appear one inevitably present
bijection since every natural number corresponds exactly one integer
The following table give first value enumeration In general notion enumeration characterization requiring domain listing function Natural number domain enumerating function assume
Under definition enumeration set ordinal α onto
The restrictive version enumeration mentioned special case α finite ordinal first limit ordinal ω
This generalized version extends aforementioned definition encompass listing
Under definition enumerated identity function two notion coincide
More generally theorem ZF set enumerated characterization coincides relabeling generalized listing enumeration
If one also assumes set enumerated coincides relabeling general form enumeration
Since work infinite set arbitrarily large default definition among group mathematician enumeration set tends arbitrary exactly listing element
Indeed Jech book common reference set theorist enumeration defined exactly
Therefore order avoid ambiguity one may use term finitely enumerable denote one corresponding type distinguished countable enumeration
Formally inclusive definition enumeration set arbitrary onto
In broad context every set trivially enumerated onto
If one assume one variant need
Even one assume axiom choice need natural
This general definition therefore lends counting notion interested many rather order
In practice broad meaning enumeration often used compare relative size different set
If one work without axiom choice one may want impose additional restriction enumeration must also without repetition since theory existence surjection onto need imply existence
In one often considers countable enumeration added requirement mapping set natural number enumerated set must
The set enumerated called computably enumerable contemporary language referring use formalization mean map computable
In sense subset natural number range computable function
In context enumerable may used mean computably enumerable
However definition characterize distinct class since uncountably many subset natural number enumerated arbitrary function domain ω countably many computable function
A specific example set enumeration computable enumeration complement
Furthermore characterization illustrates place ordering listing important
There exists computable enumeration halting set one list element increasing ordering
If one halting set would provably false
In general recursively enumerable weaker condition

In also called statistic consisting set named called type
The enumerator name usually behave language
An enumerated type seen degenerate
A enumerated type assigned enumerator value
In word enumerated type value different compared assigned specified programmer particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Although enumerator usually distinct language may allow enumerator listed twice type declaration
The name enumerator need semantically complete compatible sense
For example enumerated type called may defined consist enumerator
In language declaration enumerated type also intentionally defines member others enumerator unordered others still implicit ordering arises compiler concretely representing enumerator integer
Some enumerator type may language
The example often enumeration value
Many language allow user define new enumerated type
Values variable enumerated type usually implemented often format size compatible type
Some language especially allow user specify bit combination used enumerator
In enumerated type often regarded
Since type form may also written natural number
Some early programming language originally enumerated type
If programmer wanted variable example value red variable red would declared assigned arbitrary value usually integer constant
The variable red would assigned
Other technique assigned arbitrary value string containing name enumerator
These arbitrary value sometimes referred since often explanation number obtained whether actual value significant
These magic number could make source code harder others understand maintain
Enumerated type hand make code
Depending language compiler could automatically assign default value enumerator thereby hiding unnecessary detail programmer
These value may even visible programmer see
Enumerated type also prevent programmer writing illogical code performing mathematical operation value enumerator
If value variable assigned enumerator printed programming language could also print name enumerator rather underlying numerical value
A advantage enumerated type allow compiler enforce semantic correctness
For instance forbidden whilst accepted even internally represented
Conceptually enumerated type similar list numeric code since possible value type assigned distinctive natural number
A given enumerated type thus concrete implementation notion
When order meaningful used comparison enumerated type becomes type
tend oftentimes multiple
Enumerations frequently follow either convention others seen le frequently
In enumerated type implicitly declared listing value parenthesised list The declaration often appear type synonym declaration used multiple variable The order enumeration value given matter
An enumerated type ordinal type function give prior next value enumeration convert enumeration value integer representation
Standard Pascal offer conversion arithmetic type enumeration however
Extended Pascal offer functionality via extended function
Some Pascal dialect allow via
Some modern descendant Pascal provide special conversion syntax using method called also treat special enumerated type us standard decoding encoding
Pascal style language also allow enumeration used array index In use replaced leaving definition quite similar In addition Ada also support simple string conversion via
Similar language Ada allows internal representation enumeration specified Unlike language Ada also allows number bit enumeration specified Even one use enumeration index array like Pascal attribute defined enumeration Like Ada treat special package enumerated type
Unlike one also define character type The original dialect programming language enumerated type
They added standard C became sometimes termed
In C enumeration created explicit definition keyword cause allocation storage use keyword reminiscent definition C expose integer representation enumeration value directly programmer
Integers enum value mixed freely arithmetic operation enum value permitted
It even possible enum variable hold integer represent enumeration value
In fact according language definition code define constant type converted silently stored variable type
C also allows programmer choose value enumeration constant explicitly even without type
For example could used define type allows mathematical set suit represented bitwise logic operation
In C enumeration assign related name set integer value
In enumeration much flexible need provide value case enumeration
If value termed value provided enumeration case value string character value integer type
Alternatively enumeration case specify associated value type stored along different case value much union variant language
One define common set related case part one enumeration different set value appropriate type associated
In Swift enumeration type
They adopt many feature traditionally supported class computed property provide additional information enumeration current value instance method provide functionality related value enumeration represents
Enumerations also define initializers provide initial case value extended expand functionality beyond original implementation conform protocol provide standard functionality
Unlike C Swift enumeration case assigned default integer value created
In CardSuit example club diamond heart spade implicitly equal
Instead different enumeration case value right type CardSuit
Multiple case appear single line separated comma When working enumeration store integer string raw value one need explicitly assign raw value case Swift automatically assign value
For instance integer used raw value implicit value case one previous case
If first case value set value
The enumeration refinement earlier Planet enumeration integer raw value represent planet order sun In example explicit raw value implicit raw value
Dynamically typed language syntactic tradition C general provide enumeration
But Perl programming result obtained shorthand possibly Enumerated type programming language preserve small integer semantics C enums
Some arithmetic operation defined enums enum value explicitly converted integer back enum variable value declared enum definition
For example given expression allowed directly may make sense step sequence value ask many step two value deemed make le sense allowed value first converted integer
C also provides feature able define specific integer value enumeration
By possible perform binary operation enumeration thus treating enumeration value set flag
These flag tested using binary operation Enum type builtin method
The enumeration definition defines name selected integer value possible assign enum variable integer value scope enum definition
enumeration type directly inherited C work mostly like except enumeration real type giving added checking
Also structs keyword automatically combined instead naming type simply name
This simulated C using typedef provides second enumeration type implicitly converted integer type
It allows io streaming defined type
Additionally enumeration leak used Enumeration
This specified phrase enum class
For example The integral type large enough hold enumerated value smallest possible type
In specify underlying type directly
That allows forward declaration enumeration us keyword create enumerated constant
The version added enumerated type whose declaration syntax similar The Java type system however treat enumeration type separate integer intermixing enum integer value allowed
In fact enum type Java actually special rather arithmetic type enum value behave global instance class
Enum type instance method constructor argument specified separately enum value
All enum type implicitly extend abstract class
An enum type instantiated directly
Internally enum value contains integer corresponding order declared source code starting
The programmer set custom integer enum value directly one define overloaded constructor assign arbitrary value member enum class
Defining getters allows access member
The internal integer obtained enum value using method list enum value enumeration type obtained order using method
It generally discouraged programmer convert enums integer vice versa
Enumerated type using internal integer result sorted
The Java standard library provides utility class use enumeration
The class implement enum value implemented make compact efficient explicit bit manipulation safer
The class implement enum value object
It implemented array integer value enum value serving index
A helpful addition standard set datatypes JavaScript
Like language like C enum way giving friendly name set numeric value
By default enums begin numbering member starting
This changed manually setting value one member
For example prior example start instead Or even manually set value enum A handy feature enums also go numeric value name value enum
For example value sure mapped Color enum could look corresponding name There also creating enumeration automatically generated index starting one Python enumeration enforce semantic correctness meaningless comparison incompatible enumeration always return rather raising enumerated type interoperability C hence semantics similar C C enum value integer type check done
The C example written Fortran Enumerated datatypes version automatically assigned datatype also become datatype Example Code In language lineage SML used implement enumerated type
For example syntax SML signature In language representation completely hidden programmer indeed representation employed implementation
However Haskell type derive implement get mapping type
us member type specifier state object type cardsuit club diamond heart spade
The member type specifier valid CLOS parameter specializer however
Instead equivalent may used one member set may specified eql type specifier however may used CLOS parameter specializer
In word define method cover enumerated type method must defined specific element type
Additionally may used define arbitrary enumerated type runtime
For instance would refer type equivalent prior definition cardsuit course would simply using may le confusing function stylistic reason
Some support enumerated type directly
provides enumerated type allowable value specified string table created
The value stored numeric index empty string stored first string value stored second string value stored etc
Values stored retrieved numeric index string value
support enumerated type enumeration facet used constraining primitive datatypes string

I wonder difference relation type
A symbol primitive datatype whose instance unique form enumerated type data type consisting set named value called element member enumerator type
Since data type set value exactly data type symbol data type enumerated
It seems value enumerated type symbol
But first quote say A symbol data type contradicts thought symbol value
This much question terminology without history possible authority determine right
These two kind value similar sense considered atomic entity distinguished representation string character alphabet possibly minor constraint regarding use character start alphabetic character
These constraint really immaterial since matter mainly whether two symbol different
A like set string meeting constraint though actually limited implementation language like anything else
An enumerated type defined giving explicitly enumeration value type also representation string character
Since enumeration explicit
Languages often consider value ordered order definition
Thus

Sometimes arbitrary alphabetical
ordering may provided may help algorithm
But semantics attached
In language You usually one type symbol
However easy make data abstraction available
Symbols usually implemented like identifier table interpreted language actually stand identifier interpreter
Enumerated type defined programmer may define several type
One source problem may least language use name different enumerated value type course different enumerated type
Of course I abbreviating illegally since list must completely enumerated
But I use identifier program I may know meant
This resolved various mean scoping casting etc
You usually get problem symbol one type specific syntax value
If define abstraction usually use different syntax value
But getting issue
For specific point
Your quote would accurate said A symbol value datatype
It likely people talk value enumerated type
Another word
But two word many us Again I wish enter terminology dispute
It moderately constructive
By posting answer agree

This program suppose ask user size popcorn drink output total choice using enumeration type swtich case size price
I dont know I wrong

Short enumeration enum found C ANSI original K R
The idea instead using represent set value type restricted set value used instead
For example use color rainbow If enums exist might use C specify value
Eg The problem many color
If violet value assigns value variable clearly bug might detected valid value int
An enum type consisting set named constant called enumerator
The color rainbow would mapped like
Now internally compiler use int hold value supplied red orange etc
The point type variable type assigned
C easier going ie le strictly typed C wo allow assignment unless force using cast
You stuck generated value assign integer constant shown
Having blue indigo value mistake enumerator might include synonym scarlet crimson
In C declaration must preceded word In though needed distinct type need enum type prefix
In C value accessed type name Using enums increase level abstraction let programmer think value mean rather worry stored accessed
This reduces occurrence bug
We set traffic light three
In UK sequence traffic light change four phase
The light controlled writing bottom three bit control byte
These laid bit pattern binary RYG represent three bit
If R red light etc
In case easy see four state correspond value
With function In C need create class operator allow type
By using enums prevent problem bit assigned bulb control byte
It might bit control Green Lane switch
In case bug allows bit set normal use could wreak havoc
To sure mask bit matter value passed bottom three bit changed
Enums benefit There error
Please try
Thank signing

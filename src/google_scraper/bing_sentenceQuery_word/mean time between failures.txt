Short average time device function failing
MTBF rating measured hour indicate sturdiness
Typical MTBF rating hour
This mean drive tested one failure occurred every hour testing
Disk drive typically tested hour would unlikely failure occur short testing period
Because MTBF rating also predicted based product experience analyzing known factor raw data supplied manufacturer

Mean time failure MTTF length time device product expected last operation
MTTF one many way evaluate reliability piece hardware technology
Mean time failure extremely similar another related term mean time failure MTBF
The difference term MTBF used product repaired returned use MTTF used product
When MTTF used measure repair option
As metric MTTF represents long product reasonably expected perform field based specific testing
It important note however mean time failure metric provided company regarding specific product component may collected running one unit continuously failure
Instead MTTF data often collected running many unit even many thousand unit specific number hour
One main situation term like MTTF extremely important hardware piece product used system
Here becomes valuable know general reliability item
For item MTTF statistic great interest engineer others assessing piece part larger system

Learn something new every day email Mean time failure measurement average amount time take place catastrophic system failure computer system
In order calculate mean time failure system need operate fail
The system repaired put back operation eventually fail
The time failure first value mean system accumulates failure mean time becomes accurate
There two basic term make concept mean time failure
The type mean referred arithmetic mean better known average
As average number used calculate average accurate final result
Since computer system constantly fail mean time generally average large number different system used built similar manner
The big part term failure
In computer term many different type failure
In case failure total system shutdown
The system broken beyond ability continue operating must repaired go back service
If single part computer fails like single considered failure calculating mean time failure
In addition scheduled downtime like maintenance failure
These value often used early warning sign undiagnosed hardware issue
If system mean time failure low obviously problem system somewhere
Computer designer also look caused failure addition length time
This give clearer indication problem may exist need happen fixed
Maintenance personnel use average time failure design system maintenance schedule
If one system pushing mean time another month away make easier determine system work first
A full overhaul technically reset system mean time create longer interval failure effectively pushing mean time higher
The mean time failure value one many value used computer denote system failure
Other common term include mean time failure long take catastrophically fail first time mean time critical failure failure important take system offline
There also mean time unit replacement measure average time one system need replaced another
One editor review suggestion make change warranted

I reading disk redudancy
I read following Suppose mean time failure disk hour
Then mean time failure disk array disk hour I understand
Why instead
Then textbook say next paragraph concerning mirrored disk If mean time failure single disk hour mean time repair hour mean time data loss Now multiplies disk MTTF divided
Can anyone please help figure calculate
In case matter text book Database Concepts Silberschatz edition paragraph Improvement reliability via redundancy page Think way
A single disk fails average hour
Now disk
How long one fails
It almost certainly take much le hour fail much hour fail
This course depends distribution failure assumed exponential
Here another example keep throwing one die show average throw
Now suppose throw two dice
How long expect wait show
Certainly le throw
In fact throw average
In second example need disk fail order data loss occur
Not also want failure event within hour since otherwise system recover repairing faulty disk
Hopefully book explains calculation somewhere book useless tell instructor use different one perhaps le picture content n th edition prepared finance publisher new yacht
I think problem interesting
So I want provide explanation I think help understand better
The die example Yuval provides interesting
Because distribution known simple
Let P k probability shown kth try kth try
P P P k So expected number try see kP k If throw two dy time let P k probability shown kth try kth try
Then P P P k expected number try see kP k The sum equation could derived formula
x x If know distribution event could roughly estimate value
For die problem know every try produce one
So throw time
Every try produce two
So rate happening

So roughly every try produce
close
In case drive
The mean time failure disk hour assume drive definitely fail hour
So within hour would failed drive
In average every hour failed drive assume first failed drive appear hour
For two disk mirrored case assume A disk B disk
In order lose data A B need failed time
A already failed within hour B disk fail data lost
The case B already failed within hour A fail data lost
For first case A disk failed hour every hour
order make B fail need hour
Because case time reduced By posting answer agree

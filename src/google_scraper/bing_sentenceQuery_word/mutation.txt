used design new software test evaluate quality existing software test
Mutation testing involves modifying program small way
Each mutated version called test detect reject mutant causing behavior original version differ mutant
This called mutant
Test suite measured percentage mutant kill
New test designed kill additional mutant
Mutants based either mimic typical programming error using wrong operator variable name force creation valuable test dividing expression zero
The purpose help tester develop effective test locate weakness test data used program section code seldom never accessed
Mutation testing form
Most article program mutation program modified
A general definition using rule defined syntactic structure make systematic change software artifact
Mutation analysis applied problem usually applied testing
So defined using mutation analysis design new software test evaluate existing software test
Thus mutation analysis testing applied design model specification database test XML type software artifact although program mutation common
Tests created verify correctness implementation given software system creation test still pose question whether test correct sufficiently cover requirement originated implementation
This technological problem instance deeper philosophical problem named Who guard guard
In context mutation testing pioneered locate expose weakness
The theory mutant introduced without behavior generally program affected indicated either code mutated never executed dead code test suite unable locate fault represented mutant
For function scale large number mutant usually introduced large program leading compilation execution extremely large number copy program
This problem expense mutation testing reduced practical use method software testing increased use framework led creation mutation testing tool many programming language way test individual portion application
Mutation testing originally proposed Richard Lipton student first developed published DeMillo Lipton Sayward
The first implementation mutation testing tool part work titled
Recently availability massive computing power resurgence mutation analysis within computer science community work done define method applying mutation testing
In company called Certess part extended many principle hardware verification domain
Whereas mutation analysis expects detect difference output produced Certess extends verifying checker testbench actually detect difference
This extension mean three stage verification namely activation propagation detection evaluated
They called functional qualification
considered special case mutation testing
In fuzzing message data exchanged inside communication interface inside software instance mutated catch failure difference processing data
evolved concept fully stateful mutation testing platform complete monitor thoroughly exercising protocol implementation
Mutation testing based two hypothesis
The first hypothesis
This hypothesis state software fault introduced experienced programmer due small syntactic error
The second hypothesis called
The coupling effect asserts simple fault cascade form emergent fault
Subtle important fault also revealed mutant support coupling effect
mutant enabled creating mutant one mutation
Mutation testing done selecting set mutation operator applying source program one time applicable piece source code
The result applying one mutation operator program called
If test suite able detect change
one test fails mutant said
For example consider following code fragment The condition mutation operator would replace produce following mutant Now test kill mutant following three condition met These condition collectively called
requires first second condition satisfied
requires three condition satisfied
Strong mutation powerful since ensures test suite really catch problem
Weak mutation closely related method
It requires much le computing power ensure test suite satisfies weak mutation testing strong mutation testing
However case possible find test case could kill mutant
The resulting program behaviorally equivalent original one
Such mutant called
Equivalent mutant detection one biggest obstacle practical usage mutation testing
The effort needed check mutant equivalent high even small program
A systematic literature review wide range approach overcome Equivalent Mutant Problem presented identified relevant technique article three category technique detecting DEM suggesting SEM avoiding equivalent mutant generation AEMG
The experiment indicated Higher Order Mutation general JudyDiffOp strategy particular provide promising approach Equivalent Mutant Problem
Many mutation operator explored researcher
Here example mutation operator imperative language These mutation operator also called traditional mutation operator
There also mutation operator language concurrent construction complex object like container etc
Operators container called mutation operator
For example muJava tool offer various mutation operator Access Modifier Change Type Cast Operator Insertion Type Cast Operator Deletion
Mutation operator also developed perform security vulnerability testing program

I everything implemented problem I really like GAs work general really cool relatively new concept
However I wondering specific algorithm I use selection crossover mutation
I understand often depends data type example individual chromosome order important use crossover algorithm listed maybe added list I choose
What I consider I selecting algorithm use three thing
Currently I implemented Tournament selection partially matched crossover index shuffling mutation give exact output I want I know best choice problem

This purposefully abstract possible I looking answer specific problem anybody go choosing algorithm best particular situation

Different type selection different advantage disadvantage
You mostly find right one trial error

The optimal crossover technique usually
A general rule avoid using single point crossover suggested

Some mutation guideline provided
TL DR see table end After several day reading academic paper I came one simple conclusion problem specific
My advice anybody reading answer test test test
Not different method selection crossover mutation also different combination
I using DEAP python library implement GA I restricted method already implemented source code I plan spend fair amount time contributing library increase option I finished current project really great made writing GA much faster swapping different selection crossover mutation function much much easier

Mutations change genetic sequence main cause diversity among organism
These change occur many different level widely differing consequence
In biological system capable must first focus whether heritable specifically mutation affect individual carry others affect descendant
For mutation affect organism descendant must occur cell produce next generation affect hereditary material
Ultimately interplay inherited mutation environmental pressure generates diversity among
Although various type molecular change exist word typically refers change affect nucleic acid
In cellular organism nucleic acid building block virus building block either DNA
One way think DNA RNA substance carry memory information required reproduction
This article focus mutation DNA although keep mind RNA subject essentially mutation force
If mutation occur cell change categorized somatic mutation
The word somatic come Greek word mean body somatic mutation affect present organism body
From evolutionary perspective somatic mutation uninteresting unless occur systematically change fundamental property individual capacity survival
For example potent affect single organism survival
As different focus evolutionary theory mostly interested DNA change cell produce next generation
The statement mutation random profoundly true profoundly untrue time
The true statement stem fact best knowledge consequence mutation influence whatsoever mutation occur
In word mutation occur randomly respect whether effect useful
Thus beneficial DNA change happen often simply organism could benefit
Moreover even organism acquired beneficial mutation lifetime corresponding information flow back DNA germline
This fundamental insight Lamarck got wrong Charles Darwin got right
However idea mutation random regarded untrue one considers fact type mutation occur equal probability
Rather occur frequently others favored biochemical reaction
These reaction also main reason mutation inescapable property system capable reproduction real world
Mutation rate usually low biological system go extraordinary length keep low possible mostly many mutational effect harmful
Nonetheless mutation rate never reach zero even despite protective mechanism like DNA repair DNA mechanism like melanin deposition skin cell reduce damage
Beyond certain point avoiding mutation simply becomes costly cell
Thus mutation always present powerful force
So mutation occur
The answer question closely linked molecular detail DNA entire organized
The smallest mutation point mutation single base pair changed another base pair
Yet another type mutation nonsynonymous mutation sequence changed
Such mutation lead either production different premature termination protein
As opposed nonsynonymous mutation synonymous mutation change amino acid sequence although occur definition sequence code amino acid
Synonymous mutation exist many amino acid encoded multiple codon
Base pair also diverse regulating property located intergenic region even within coding sequence
For historic reason group often subsumed synonymous mutation label silent mutation
Depending function silent mutation anything truly silent extraordinarily important latter implying working sequence kept constant purifying
This likely explanation existence ultraconserved noncoding element survived million year without substantial change found comparing genome several vertebrate Sandelin
Mutations may also take form insertion deletion together known indels
Indels wide variety length
At short end spectrum indels one two base pair within coding sequence greatest effect inevitably cause frameshift addition one codon keep protein approximately intact
At intermediate level indels affect part whole group gene
At largest level whole chromosome even whole copy genome affected insertion deletion although mutation usually longer subsumed label indel
At high level also possible invert translocate entire section chromosome chromosome even fuse break apart
If large number gene lost result one process consequence usually harmful
Of course different genetic system react differently event
Finally still source mutation many different type transposable element small entity DNA posse mechanism permit move around within genome
Some element copy paste new location others use method
Such movement disrupt existing gene function middle another gene activate dormant gene function perfect excision gene switched earlier insertion occasionally lead production new gene pasting material different gene together
A single mutation large effect many case evolutionary change based accumulation many mutation small effect
Mutational effect beneficial harmful neutral depending context location
Most mutation deleterious
In general base pair affected mutation larger effect mutation larger mutation probability deleterious
To better understand impact mutation researcher started estimate distribution mutational effect DMEs quantify many mutation occur effect given property biological system
In evolutionary study property interest molecular system biology emerging property might also interest
It extraordinarily difficult obtain reliable information DMEs corresponding effect span many order magnitude lethal neutral advantageous addition many confounding factor usually complicate analysis
To make thing even difficult many mutation also interact alter effect phenomenon referred
However despite uncertainty recent work repeatedly indicated overwhelming majority mutation small effect Figure Keightley
Of course much work needed order obtain detailed information DMEs fundamental property governs evolution every biological system
Many direct indirect method developed help estimate rate different type mutation various organism
The main difficulty estimating rate mutation involves fact DNA change extremely rare event detected background identical DNA
Because biological system usually influenced many factor direct estimate mutation rate desirable
Direct estimate typically involve use known descendant inherited DNA sequence
To measure mutation rate using method one first need sequence many base pair within region DNA many individual pedigree counting observed mutation
These observation combined number generation connect individual compute overall mutation rate
Such direct estimate confused substitution rate estimated phylogenetic time span
Mutation rate vary within genome genome
Much work required researcher obtain precise estimate frequency different mutation
The rise genomic sequencing method nurture hope able cultivate detailed precise understanding mutation rate
Because mutation one fundamental force evolution work continue paramount importance

Mutations alteration DNA sequence
If one think information DNA series sentence mutation error spelling word make sentence
Sometimes mutation inconsequential like misspelled word whose meaning still quite clear
At time mutation stronger ramification like sentence whose meaning completely changed
All living organism tiniest bacteria plant human being built microscopic cell case bacteria entire organism single cell
At core cell deoxyribonucleic acid molecular blueprint nearly every aspect existence
If one begin zoom structure DNA first level magnification consists two intertwined chain shape double helix
Each chain made
In turn nucleotide complex three entity sugar called deoxyribose phosphate group base compound ready accept hydrogen ion
DNA nucleotide following base adenine A guanine G cytosine C thymine T
Nucleotides often referred base contain
The sugar phosphate various nucleotide sit chain part double helix nucleotide base reach across gap latch onto base side
All DNA really look like double helical ladder base rung common analogy
The base latch one another adenine A thymine T cytosine C guanine G
This known
When one refers DNA sequence indicates sequence nucleotide one strand
Because nucleotide bind one another predictable manner knowing sequence one strand make easy fill sequence
Genes part DNA sequence instruct cellular machinery synthesize protein
In organism bacteria plant animal human gene contain two type DNA sequence intron exon interspersed throughout gene
The DNA sequence carry instruction cell code individual subunit protein called
How exon convey amino acid need picked build protein
A set three contiguous nucleotide exon act molecular tag known
A single codon corresponds one amino acid
Moreover
For example codon ATT ATC ATA code amino acid isoleucine
Overall reading information contained gene ultimately producing protein process
ribonucleic acid short single stranded nucleotide chain produced intermediate step
In contrast DNA RNA contains sugar ribose nucleotide uracil U instead thymine T
DNA provides source material synthesis RNA type known messenger RNA mRNA via process
According author Garland Science transcription region double helix unravels one DNA strand serf template mRNA synthesis
The nucleotide resulting mRNA complementary template DNA uracil complementary adenine
According published journal Nature Education region corresponding intron cut spliced form mature mRNA strand
This strand act template build protein via process
During translation mRNA codon instruct cellular machinery choose specific amino acid
For example codon AUU AUC AUA correspond amino acid isoleucine
Mutations change occur nucleotide sequence DNA
They occur spontaneously DNA replicated also induced environmental factor chemical UV ray said associate professor department cell regenerative biology University
According material published replication error human cell occur every nucleotide turn amount error time one cell divide
However good news case cell capacity repair error
Or body destroys cell repaired thereby preventing population aberrant cell expanding
Broadly mutation fall two category somatic mutation germline mutation according author Freeman
Somatic mutation occur namesake refers various cell one body involved reproduction skin cell example
If replication cell somatic mutation stopped population aberrant cell expand
However somatic mutation passed organism offspring
On hand germline mutation occur reproductive cell multicellular organism sperm egg cell example
Such mutation passed organism offspring
Moreover according mutation carry pretty much every cell offspring body
However based DNA sequence changed rather many different type mutation occur
For instance sometimes error DNA replication switch single nucleotide replace another thereby changing nucleotide sequence one codon
According published journal Nature Education type error also known base substitution lead following mutation In type mutation altered codon corresponds different amino acid
As result incorrect amino acid inserted protein synthesized
In type mutation instead tagging amino acid altered codon signal transcription stop
Thus shorter mRNA strand produced resulting protein truncated nonfunctional
Since different codon correspond amino acid sometimes base substitution affect amino acid picked
For example ATT ATC ATA correspond isoleucine
If base substitution occur codon ATT changing last nucleotide T C A everything would remain resulting protein
The mutation would go undetected remain silent
Sometimes nucleotide inserted deleted DNA sequence replication
Or small stretch DNA duplicated
Such error result
Since continuous group three nucleotide form codon insertion deletion duplication change three nucleotide grouped together read codon
In essence shift reading frame
Frameshift mutation result cascade incorrect amino acid resulting protein function properly
The mutation mentioned thus far rather stable
That even population aberrant cell mutation replicate expand nature mutation would remain resulting cell
However exists class mutation called
In case short nucleotide sequence repeat initial mutation
However aberrant cell divide number nucleotide repeat increase
This phenomenon known repeat expansion
Most often mutation come mind cause various disease
Though several example listed according mutation usually common general population
caused dynamic mutation occurs men woman
Dynamic mutation rather insidious since severity disease increase number nucleotide repeat increase
In fragile X syndrome nucleotide sequence CGG repeat time within gene called normal number anywhere repeat
This high number CGG repeat lead delayed speech language skill level intellectual disability anxiety hyperactive behavior
However fewer number repeat repeat considered normal intellect
Since gene X chromosome mutation also heritable
A variant adult hemoglobin known occur due missense mutation cause amino acid valine take place glutamic acid
If one inherits aberrant gene parent lead condition known
The disease get name fact red blood cell usually contract resemble sickle
Those condition suffer anemia regular infection pain
Estimates suggest condition occurs African Americans Hispanic Americans
Mutations also occur due environmental factor
For example according published Journal Biomedicine Biotechnology UV ray sun particularly wave responsible causing mutation tumor suppressor gene called The mutated gene implicated skin cancer
Mutations important implication
They create variation within gene population
According Genetics Home Resource Handbook genetic variant seen percent population called polymorphism
The different eye hair color various blood group occur due polymorphism
In broad scheme thing mutation also function tool evolution aiding development new trait characteristic specie
The accumulation multiple mutation single pathway gene participating single developmental program likely responsible speciation creation new specie said
According resource published University California Museum Paleontology germline mutation play role evolution since heritable
It also important note mutation random say occur fulfill requirement given population

The whole human family one specie gene
Mutation creates slightly different version gene called allele
These small difference DNA sequence make every individual unique
They account variation see human hair color skin color height shape behavior susceptibility disease
Individuals specie vary physical appearance behavior
Genetic variation useful help population change time
Variations help organism survive reproduce passed next generation
Variations hinder survival reproduction eliminated population
This process natural selection lead significant change appearance behavior physiology individual population generation
Once new allele arise meiosis sexual reproduction combine different allele new way increase genetic variation
It useful think mutation process creates genetic variation
We often refer mutation genetic variation
This approach useful come gene associated disease disease allele carry mutation DNA change compromise protein function
However approach give mutation bad name
It important remember losing function gene always affect health
For example mammal hundred gene code olfactory receptor protein help u smell
Losing one gene probably make much difference
In contrast variation cause disease many example variation neither good bad blood type eye color
Just like disease allele process mutation creates neutral variation
But neutral variation impossible tell allele normal one existed first mutant distinction often meaningless
Mutation creates variation portion gene affect protein
But even often creates variation switch control protein active much protein made
Lactase enzyme help infant break lactose sugar milk
Normally gene code lactase active baby turned age four
When people make lactase consume milk experience gas nausea discomfort
But people variation genetic switch keep lactase gene active
This variation called lactase persistence people keep milk diet even adult
Radiation chemical byproduct cellular metabolism free radical ultraviolet ray agent damage thousand nucleotide cell every day
They affect nucleotide converting one base another knocking base backbone even causing break DNA strand
Most time mutation reversed
DNA repair machine constantly work cell fixing mismatched nucleotide splicing broken DNA strand back together
Yet DNA change remain
If cell accumulates many DNA damaged repair machinery fix either stop dividing
If process go wrong cell could become cancerous
When put sun screen protecting mutation somatic cell make body involved ZeroWidthSpace Only DNA change carried egg sperm cell passed next generation
Believe certain amount sloppiness built system
Without mutation would variation without variation would evolution

Determine gene mutation cause genetic disease others
Teisha Rowland PhD Science Buddies Sandra Slutz PhD Science Buddies The Human Genome Project estimated human genome contains around
Each gene made hundred million nucleotide
Sometimes single DNA change DNA sequence cause person devastating researcher able identify mutation responsible causing thousand different genetic disease condition
But sometimes DNA mutation may harm
It DNA mutation located
Every gene human body consists DNA deoxyribonucleic acid
DNA genetic code made four different type adenine A thymine T guanine G cytosine C
This DNA code turned ribonucleic acid body process called
In RNA nucleotide called uracil substitute every thymine
The RNA go process called turn
During translation every three RNA nucleotide code single amino acid
This set three nucleotide called different codon may code amino acid
In end sequence DNA turned sequence amino acid joined together long chain called protein
Proteins responsible function cell
Many thing happen process prevent gene turning protein protein created
In gene single DNA nucleotide mutated example adenine A guanine G may cause wrong amino acid made
If wrong amino acid made assembled long chain amino acid resulting protein may work
This different amino acid different many way size electric charge
These different characteristic affect interact well molecule surround amino acid water
For example positively negatively charged molecule prefer interact water called whereas nonpolar molecule like interact charged molecule water called
These seemingly small difference large consequence
For example cystic fibrosis mutation gene called gene encodes channel control flow particle cell
Specifically channel normally regulates whether small negatively charged particle called chloride ion flow flow cell
The movement charged particle act balance flow water cell
In people cystic fibrosis mutated gene creates channel function consequently flow water tissue abnormal
In turn abnormal flow water cause build thick mucus lining many internal organ many devastating effect different part body see Figure
Cystic fibrosis caused mutation gene encodes chloride channel important regulating water flow cell
Because many bodily function rely normal water flow disruption water flow cause number devastating effect shown Manifestations Cystic Fibrosis image Wikimedia Commons While DNA mutation clearly cause number genetic disease DNA mutation may problematic
In science project investigate cystic fibrosis genetic mutation cause using online genetic database

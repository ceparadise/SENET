Most people believe term data information interchangeable mean thing
However distinct difference two
text word number put context mean little nothing human
However useful usually formatted manner allows understood human
Computers typically read data necessarily something computer actually understands
Through use formula programming script software application computer turn data information human understand
Below example data information differ
Joe Circle SLC Joe Smith Circle Salt Lake City UT As see example looked data may able understand text line really useful
That information broken readable text even slightly formatted becomes much useful allows identify contact information Joe Smith
In example data could file parsed make usable information

value
Pieces data individual piece
While concept data commonly associated data collected huge range organization institution including business sale data revenue profit government rate organization census number organization
Data whereupon using graph image analysis tool
Data general refers fact existing form suitable better usage
unprocessed data collection cleaned corrected researcher
Raw data need corrected remove obvious instrument data entry error thermometer reading outdoor Arctic location recording tropical temperature
Data processing commonly occurs stage processed data one stage may considered raw data next stage
raw data collected uncontrolled environment
data generated within context scientific investigation observation recording
Data described new
The first English use word data
Using word data mean transmittable storable computer information first done
The expression data processing first used
The plural thing given neuter past participle give
Data may used plural noun sense writer using singular plural
In though everyday writing data commonly used singular like information sand rain
Data closely related concept role relation term meaning
According common view data collected analyzed data becomes information suitable making decision analyzed fashion
derived extensive amount experience dealing information subject
For example height generally considered data
The height recorded precisely entered database
This data may included book along data Mount Everest describe mountain manner useful wish make decision best method climb
Using understanding based experience climbing mountain advise person way reach Mount Everest peak may seen knowledge
Some complement series data information knowledge wisdom would mean status person possession certain knowledge also know circumstance good use
Data often assumed least abstract concept information next least knowledge abstract
In view data becomes information interpretation height Mount Everest generally considered data book Mount Everest geological characteristic may considered information climber guidebook containing practical information best way reach Mount Everest peak may considered knowledge
Information bear diversity meaning range everyday usage technical use
This view however also argued provide model relation data information knowledge
Generally speaking concept information closely related notion constraint communication control data form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception representation
us concept differentiate data information data series symbol information occurs symbol used refer something
Before development computing device machine people could collect data impose pattern
Since development computing device machine device also collect data
In computer widely used many field collect data sort process discipline ranging analysis usage citizen scientific research
These pattern data seen information used enhance knowledge
These pattern may interpreted though truth subjective concept may authorized aesthetic ethical criterion discipline culture
Events leave behind perceivable physical virtual remains traced back data
Marks longer considered data link mark observation broken
Mechanical computing device classified according mean represent data
An represents datum voltage distance position physical quantity
A represents piece data sequence symbol drawn fixed
The common digital computer use binary alphabet alphabet two character typically denoted
More familiar representation number letter constructed binary alphabet
Some special form data distinguished
A collection data interpreted instruction
Most computer language make distinction program data program operate language notably similar language program essentially indistinguishable data
It also useful distinguish description data
A similar yet earlier term metadata ancillary data
The prototypical example metadata library catalog description content book
Gathering data accomplished primary source researcher first person obtain data secondary source researcher obtains data already collected source data disseminated scientific journal
Data analysis methodology vary include data triangulation data percolation
The latter offer articulate method collecting classifying analyzing data using five possible angle analysis least three order maximize research objectivity permit understanding phenomenon investigation complete possible qualitative quantitative method literature review including scholarly article interview expert computer simulation
The data thereafter percolated using series step extract relevant information
Though data also increasingly used field suggested highly interpretive nature might odds ethos data given
Peter Checkland introduced term Latin take distinguish immense number possible data attention oriented
argued since humanity affirm knowledge production situated partial constitutive using may introduce assumption counterproductive example phenomenon discrete
The term emphasizes act observation constitutive offered alternative visual representation humanity

Once recognised pattern problem use abstraction gather general characteristic filter detail need order solve problem
Abstraction one four cornerstone Computer Science
It involves filtering essentially ignoring characteristic need order concentrate
In problem look pattern among within smaller problem make complex problem
Abstraction process filtering ignoring characteristic pattern need order concentrate
It also filtering specific detail
From create representation idea trying solve
In looked problem draw series cat
We noted cat general characteristic common cat eg eye tail fur liking fish ability make meowing sound
In addition cat fur tail eye love meow

In order draw basic cat need know tail fur eye
These characteristic relevant
We need know sound cat make like fish
These characteristic irrelevant filtered
We need know cat tail fur eye need know size colour
These specific filtered
From general characteristic tail fur eye build basic idea cat ie cat basically look like
Once know cat look like describe draw basic cat
Abstraction allows u create general idea problem solve
The process instructs u remove specific detail pattern help u solve problem
This help u form idea problem
This idea known model
If abstract may end wrong solution problem trying solve
With cat example abstract might think cat long tail short fur
Having abstracted know although cat tail fur tail long fur short
In case abstraction helped u form clearer model cat

CHARACTERISTICS OF FUR No image may downloaded used without express written permission Shoots Chinchilla Ranch

All leopard unique rosette pattern fur range pale yellow tan
Their dark spot become solid around head limb chest
Small rounded ear extend leopard broad face also long sensory whisker around muzzle eyebrow
The color leopard fur varies location help blend local surroundings
For example many desert leopard creamy yellow light brown fur leopard cooler habitat often smoky gray tinge tawny fur
Occasionally leopard born higher amount melanin genetic makeup completely black fur making spot harder see
Leopards smaller big cat take advantage compact size move stealthily land tree water
Average male weigh pound female weigh pound according LiveScience
Leopards strong jaw paw allowing kill prey quickly breaking neck
These robust feline haul carcass heavy three time body weight

He stumbled upon unfortunate creature visiting reptile breeder
It utterly covered leathery wrinkled skin lacked spiked neck frill characteristic specie
Wondering kind genetic fluke might created Milinkovitch took mutant back University Geneva study evolutionary developmental biology asked one grad student take look DNA
The result research could solve longstanding puzzle biology
In published Friday journal Science Advances Milinkovitch grad student Nicolas report mutated gene robbed bearded dragon scale gene control feather development bird fur mammal
Although three feature look different adult animal start place
It interesting really key feature allow u recognize lineage Milinkovitch said
How recognize bird
Because feather
And mammal fur reptile scale
These might look like fundamental difference noted really fundamentally
They inherited common structure diverged hugely Milinkovitch said
The current diversity feather fur scale part made origin mystifying scientist
There almost known intermediate form illustrate might related one another
That largely feature fragile bone teeth preserved fossil delicate skin appendage usually lost time
In absence physical evidence past scientist try interpret present instance studying developing embryo clue trait evolved
Early embryonic development feather fur look startlingly similar begin tiny thick accumulation cell skin known anatomical placodes
This shared morphology indicates feature evolutionary root would seem make sense since bird mammal evolved common ancestor million year ago
But ancestor also predecessor modern reptile fact reptile bird far closely related bird mammal
Yet reptile scale develop differently feather fur seemed rate
Not lot scientist study reptile embryo Milinkovitch noted model specie like fruit fly mouse tend get attention generally could find evidence anatomical placodes
That left biologist two possible explanation Milinkovitch noted neither particularly satisfying
Either placode ancestral everyone lost multiple time independent lineage reptile bird mammal invented placodes independently said
The second possibility seemed particularly unlikely research revealed exact gene called EDA controlled placode development group
That thing stood began parsing genome naked bearded dragon adviser brought back lab
He pinpointed mutation prevented scale developing discover EDA gene responsible feather fur
That prompted duo take closer look embryo normal bearded dragon development
They realized tiny creature anatomical placodes appeared dispersed differently version biologist accustomed seeing mammal bird
You look right place right time otherwise see Milinkovitch said
Now course know much easier find know look look people know overlooked
Eventually identified placodes several specie snake lizard crocodile
They obviously inherited common ancestor Milinkovitch said
That make sense ecologically speaking think innovation amniote
continued using term describe creature like reptile bird mammal whose fetus develop amniotic sac allows mother lay fertilized egg land nurture inside uterus mammal
Unlike amphibian fish amniote anchored water need lay egg
That meant worth investing adaptation allowed u live entirely terrestrial life like skin scale keep u drying
Hundreds million year reptile bird mammal diverged original amniote united outcome innovation
They extremely different morphologically look past see homology Milinkovitch said
That beauty

This describes characteristic type used
fur long used making muff stole collar trimming felt hat
Faux fur fake fur material made synthetic fiber designed resemble fur normally part piece clothing
fur varies grayish brown nearly black
The fur measure two inch length
It used mainly muff neck shoulder piece
Because abundance among important furbearing animal harvested
Their pelt used
They principally used trimming coat fur garment including evening wrap
The pelt fox popular cross fox mostly used scarf rarely trimming
The number sold fox scarf exceeds total number scarf made furbearers
However amount overshadowed total number fox pelt used trimming purpose
The silver morphs valued furrier followed cross red morphs respectively
In early century American fox skin imported Britain annually exported annually Germany Russia
The total worldwide trade wild red fox pelt
Foxes amounted US pelt worth million
particularly northern Alaska valued fur guard hair silky texture dressing provide le restricted mobility wearer
Red fox southern Alaska coastal area Aleutian Islands exception extremely coarse pelt rarely exceed third price northern Alaskan cousin
Most European peltries coarse textured fur compared North American variety
The exception Nordic Far Eastern Russian peltries still inferior North American peltries term silkiness
In nation considered furbearers albeit one low quality due sparse coarse monotonously coloured fur
Asiatic Near Eastern jackal produce coarsest pelt though remedied dressing process
As jackal hair little fur fibre skin flat appearance
The softest fur come northern Iran
Jackals known hunted fur century jackal captured annually Mervsk
In Zakatal area jackal captured
During period total jackal taken within Russia sent exclusively Nizhegorod fair
In early thousand jackal skin tanned annually Soviet Union though stock significantly underused triple amount could produced
Before onset majority jackal skin exported USA
Despite geographical variation jackal skin graded according fur standard typically used manufacture cheap collar woman coat fur coat
Jackal fur still valued along Caspian shoreline lighter warmer
fur soft somewhat resembling fox one inch long
The color varies pale gray dark brown
fur durable
The hair rather short thick soft
The guard hair break readily underfur tendency become matted
Sunlight gradually fade original dark brown color warmer tone making le attractive
Nutria fur traditionally sheared dyed plucked
Its light weight make suitable lining well coat accessory trim
Sometimes used without shearing plucking valuable fur richer brown
It sometimes promoted fur considered pest southern United States
fur inch long erect thick
It durable ranking mink fur used chiefly trimming garment
fur commonly considered byproduct process breeding rabbit meat produced large quantity seventy million year France alone
However quality fur rabbit tends low rabbit slaughtered reaching twelve week old still infant coat
In temperate climate fur obtained winter rabbit five month old thickness fur even time year varying degree hair shedding cause uneven patch fur
The coat also thickest time year
The highest quality pelt suitable typically constitute le half pelt collected
The hair Angora rabbit preferred due length caused unusually long growth phase hair cycle consequence
fur mottled gray color two inch long animal northern United States
In southern United States fur shorter
Raccoon fur reached heyday United States became fashionable among college student stay warm traveling automobile attending football game
The specie marten primarily found Russia Ural Mountains Siberia
Their fur soft silkier American marten mostly used jacket scarf hat
Crown sable also known Russian Imperial sable finest expensive quality sable
fur medium length erect posse sheen
However protracted use cause fade glistening black dull reddish brown
Before century skunk fur also described marketed Alaska sable
pelt primarily used woman garment though occasionally used short
The quality wolf peltries rest density strength fur fibre keep fur upright give pelt appealing bushy aspect
These characteristic mostly found northern wolf population gradually lessen south warmer climate
North American wolf pelt among valuable silkier fluffier Eurasian peltries
The pelt wolf killed poison mostly worthless
In Europe pelt considered practical aspect wolf though seldom used due skin foul odour
In assisted transforming wearer werewolf
Several Native American tribe used wolf pelt medicinal purpose though tribe favour dog skin wolf skin latter thinner prone tearing sewn
The wore wolf skin cape exploring enemy territory
The used wolf skin later stage WWII protect face soldier
In wolf pelt produced annually
Recent statistic indicate wolf skin internationally traded year former Soviet Union Mongolia largest exporter largest importer
Overall harvesting wolf fur little impact population northern variety whose number stable commercial value
Wolf trapping fur remains lucrative source income many Native Americans
The Maori introduced New Zealand unlike Australia natural predator
This resulted enormous wild population approximately million catastrophic effect natural vegetation
Not confused North American opossum different animal eat way estimated tonne greenery night
They legally considered pest
Since New Zealand manufacturer developing technique spin hollow possum fur fibre yarn merino wool silk creating unique fabric incomparable quality warmth durability
Amongst top three warmest fur world along Polar bear Arctic fox possum fur become viable known worn like Bill Hillary Clinton along various Hollywood star

art science planning leading software project
It project planned implemented monitored controlled
In software industry grew quickly computer company quickly recognized relatively low cost software production compared hardware production circuitry
To manage new development effort company applied established project management method project test run especially confusion occurred gray zone user specification delivered software
To able avoid problem project management method focused matching user requirement delivered product method known
As industry matured analysis software project management failure shown following common cause The first five item list show difficulty articulating need client way proper resource deliver proper project goal
Specific useful often necessary true art software project management applying correct method using tool support method
Without method tool worthless
Since several proprietary software project management method developed software manufacturer use computer consulting firm also developed similar method client
Today software project management method still evolving current trend lead away waterfall model cyclic project delivery model imitates software development process
A concerned primarily production aspect opposed technical aspect
These process exist primarily supporting management software development generally skewed toward addressing business concern
Many software development process run similar way general project management process
Examples The purpose identify scope project involved create
Project planning begin define software developed
The developed describe lead completion
The purpose project monitoring control keep team management date project progress
If project deviate plan project manager take action correct problem
Project monitoring control involves status meeting gather status team
When change need made used keep product date
In computing term issue unit work accomplish improvement system
An issue could bug requested feature task missing forth
For example used call modified version IssueZilla
As September call system Issue Tracker
The word issue also used synonym problem English usage
Problems occur time time fixing timely fashion essential achieve correctness system avoid delayed delivery product
Issues often categorized term
Different company different definition severity common one In many software company issue often investigated verify system correctness assigned developer responsible resolving
They also assigned system user phase
Issues commonly communicated using
In case email used
As subdiscipline project management regard management software development akin management performed someone management skill programming skill
rebuts view argues software development entirely work compare

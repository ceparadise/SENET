In computer science two definition word map
The first associative array type container map value one type value another type
An example
The second definition functional programming map applies function take list function applies function element list order return list result
What origin different definition map
I guessing second definition might come I sure derived another useful
The first definition make intuitive sense I sure came
Both construct define map mathematical sense mapping element one set another
Well mathematical meaning pairing element one set another

In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

What difference
I asking defined language X Y seems generally people asking SO I want know difference theory
I know object map key value
Is
What distinguishes
Two term thing used Java used Python used Javascript PHP correct mathematical term avoided separate meaning
See
One older term
Typically term Dictionary used mathematical term Map took hold
Also Dictionaries tend key type String true everywhere
Typically I assume map backed hash table connotes unordered store
Dictionaries connote ordered store
There dictionary called
In Lisp might look like Which encapsulates word The traversal top leaf yield word
My cent
Dictionary abstract class Java whereas Map interface
Since Java support multiple inheritance class extends Dictionary extend class
Therefore Map interface introduced
Dictionary class obsolete use Map preferred
Yes may add Associative Array mix
using ofter refers implementation
purely theoretical level
A Dictionary value used locate Linked Value
A Map Value provides instruction locate another value collection allow non linear access ie get first get last Map even simple Array index map correct value
So Dictionary Type map map much broader range possible function
In Practice usually mapping function defines name HashMap mapped data structure us hashing algorithm link key value Dictionary specify key linked value could stored via linked list tree algorithm
usage end usually care algorithm work use generic dictionary shift one structure need enfore type algorithm Not really thing
Maps subset dictionary
Dictionary defined insert delete find function
Map used Java according dictionary requirement key mapping value strictly mapped function
A dictionary might one key map one value one key map several value like chaining hasthtable eg Twitter hashtag search
As real world example looking word dictionary give u number definition word find entry point u another entry see word number word list definition
In real world map much broader allowing u location name name coordinate also find nearest neighbor attribute population etc IMHO could argument greater expansion map type possibly graph based implementation would best always assume pair especially since nearest neighbor attribute value could data member value
java map despite requirement implement something like generalized dictionary value generalized collection value merely reference collection stored elsewhere
Remember Java maintainer maintainer ADT definition Java decision specifically Java
Other term concept fairly common associative array hash
The main difference requires entry value key pair unique key
If collision occur
new entry key entry already collection collision handling required
Usually handle collision using either
Or
A allows multiple entry linked key
When Map implemented Separate Chaining tends resemble Dictionary
These two different term concept
also refer concept

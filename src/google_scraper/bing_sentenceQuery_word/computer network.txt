A allows share resource
In computer network networked using
The connection node established using either
Network computer device originate route terminate data called network node
Nodes include well
Two device said networked together one device able exchange information device whether direct connection
In case communication protocol
carried general communication protocol
This formidable collection requires skilled keep
Computer network support enormous number access shared use printer use application well many others
Computer network differ used carry signal organize network traffic network size organizational intent
The computer network Internet
The chronology significant development includes Computer networking may considered branch since relies upon theoretical practical application related discipline
A computer network facilitates interpersonal communication allowing user communicate efficiently easily via various mean email instant messaging telephone video telephone call video conferencing
A network allows sharing network computing resource
Users may access use resource provided device network printing document shared network printer use shared storage device
A network allows sharing file data type information giving authorized user ability access information stored computer network
us computing resource across network accomplish task
A computer network may used deploy device connected network prevent device accessing network via
Computer communication link support packet traditional simply transmit data
However information computer network carried
A network packet formatted unit list bit byte usually ten byte kilobyte long carried
Packets sent network destination
Once packet arrive reassembled original message
Packets consist two kind data control information user data payload
The control information provides data network need deliver user data example source destination code sequencing information
Typically control information found
With packet transmission medium better shared among user network
When one user sending packet link filled packet user cost shared relatively little interference provided link overused
Often route packet need take network immediately available
In case packet wait link free
The physical layout network usually le important topology connects network node
Most diagram describe physical network therefore topological rather geographic
The symbol diagram usually denote network link network node
The transmission medium often referred literature used link device form computer network include
In defined layer physical layer data link layer
A widely adopted transmission medium used local area network technology collectively known
The medium protocol standard enable communication networked device Ethernet defined
Ethernet transmits data copper fiber cable
Wireless LAN standard
defined use others use signal transmission medium
us building power cabling transmit data
The order following wired technology roughly slowest fastest transmission speed
Price main factor distinguishing option business
Wireless option command price premium make purchasing wired computer printer device financial benefit
Before making decision purchase technology product review restriction limitation selection necessary
Business employee need may override cost consideration
There various attempt transporting data exotic medium Both case large give slow communication prevent sending large amount information
Apart physical transmission medium may network comprise additional basic building block NICs
Any particular piece equipment frequently contain multiple building block perform multiple function
A NIC provides computer ability access transmission medium ability process network information
For example NIC may connector accepting cable aerial wireless transmission reception associated circuitry
The NIC responds traffic addressed either NIC computer whole
In network network interface controller unique MAC stored controller permanent memory
To avoid address conflict network device IEEE maintains administers MAC address uniqueness
The size Ethernet MAC address six
The three significant octet reserved identify NIC manufacturer
These manufacturer using assigned prefix uniquely assign three octet every Ethernet interface produce
A device receives network clean unnecessary noise regenerates
The signal higher power level side obstruction signal cover longer distance without degradation
In twisted pair Ethernet configuration repeater required cable run longer meter
With fiber optic repeater ten even hundred kilometer apart
A repeater multiple port known
Repeaters work physical layer OSI model
Repeaters require small amount time regenerate signal
This cause affect network performance may affect proper function
As result many network architecture limit number repeater used row Ethernet
Hubs repeater LANs mostly obsoleted modern
A connects filter traffic two layer form single network
This break network collision domain maintains unified broadcast domain
Network segmentation break large congested network aggregation smaller efficient network
Bridges come three basic type A device forward filter based destination MAC address frame
A switch distinct hub forward frame physical port involved communication rather port connected
It thought bridge
It learns associate physical port MAC address examining source address received frame
If unknown destination targeted switch broadcast port source
Switches normally numerous port facilitating star topology device cascading additional switch
capable routing based layer addressing additional logical level
The term often used loosely include device router bridge well device may distribute traffic based load based application content Web identifier
A device forward network processing routing information included packet datagram Internet protocol information layer
The routing information often processed conjunction routing table forwarding table
A router us routing table determine forward packet
A destination routing table include null interface also known black hole interface data go however processing done said data
packet dropped
used connect network node via wire originally designed digital network traffic wireless
To one digital signal produce tailored give required property transmission
Modems commonly used telephone line using technology
A network device controlling network security access rule
Firewalls typically configured reject access request unrecognized source allowing action recognized one
The vital role firewall play network security grows parallel constant increase
layout organizational hierarchy interconnected node computer network
Different network topology affect throughput reliability often critical
With many technology bus network single failure cause network fail entirely
In general interconnection robust network expensive install
Common layout Note physical layout node network may necessarily reflect network topology
As example network topology ring actually two ring physical topology often star neighboring connection routed via central physical location
An virtual computer network built top another network
Nodes overlay network connected virtual logical link
Each link corresponds path perhaps many physical link underlying network
The topology overlay network may often differ underlying one
For example many network overlay network
They organized node virtual system link run top Internet
Overlay network around since invention networking computer system connected telephone line using data network existed
The striking example overlay network Internet
The Internet initially built overlay
Even today Internet node communicate virtually underlying mesh wildly different topology technology
mean allow mapping fully connected IP overlay network underlying network
Another example overlay network map key node network
In case underlying network IP network overlay network table actually indexed key
Overlay network also proposed way improve Internet routing guarantee achieve
Previous proposal seen wide acceptance largely require modification network
On hand overlay network incrementally deployed running overlay protocol software without cooperation
The overlay network control packet routed underlying network two overlay node control example sequence overlay node message traverse reach destination
For example manages overlay network provides reliable efficient content delivery kind
Academic research includes end system multicast resilient routing quality service study among others
A set rule exchanging information network
In also see protocol leverage service protocol
An important example protocol stack running protocol
This stack used home user personal computer user surfing web
While use protocol layering today ubiquitous across field computer networking historically criticized many researcher two principal reason
Firstly abstracting protocol stack way may cause higher layer duplicate functionality lower layer prime example error recovery basis basis
Secondly common protocol implementation one layer may require data state addressing information present another layer thus defeating point separating layer first place
For example us ECN field indication congestion IP protocol whereas TCP protocol
Communication protocol various characteristic
They may may use may use hierarchical addressing flat addressing
There many communication protocol described
family IEEE standard dealing local area network metropolitan area network
The complete IEEE protocol suite provides diverse set networking capability
The protocol flat addressing scheme
They operate mostly level
For example deal routing Ethernet packet using
describes defines protocol form basis authentication mechanism used VLANs also found WLANs home user see user enter wireless access key
sometimes simply called family protocol used wired LANs described set standard together called published
also widely known WLAN WiFi probably member protocol family home user today
It standarized share many property wired Ethernet
The also called foundation modern networking
It offer well service inherently unreliable network traversed transmission IP level
At core protocol suite defines addressing identification routing specification next generation protocol much enlarged addressing capability
SONET Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH standardized protocol transfer multiple digital bit stream optical fiber using laser
They originally designed transport circuit mode communication variety different source primarily support uncompressed voice encoded Modulation format
However due protocol neutrality feature also obvious choice transporting ATM frame
ATM switching technique telecommunication network
It us asynchronous encodes data small
This differs protocol use variable sized packet
ATM similarity switched networking
This make good choice network must handle traditional data traffic content voice video
ATM us model must established two endpoint actual data exchange begin
While role ATM diminishing favor still play role connection home user
There number different digital cellular standard including GSM GPRS EDGE UMTS DECT iDEN
A network characterized physical capacity organizational purpose
Use network including user authorization access right differ accordingly
A network key component implemented nanoscale including message carrier leverage physical principle differ macroscale communication mechanism
Nanoscale communication extends communication small sensor actuator found biological system also tends operate environment would harsh classical communication
A PAN computer network used communication among computer different information technological device close one person
Some example device used PAN personal computer printer fax machine telephone PDAs scanner even video game console
A PAN may include wired wireless device
The reach PAN typically extends meter
A wired PAN usually constructed USB FireWire connection technology Bluetooth infrared communication typically form wireless PAN
A LAN network connects computer device limited geographical area home school office building closely positioned group building
Each computer device network
Wired LANs likely based technology
Newer standard also provide way create wired LAN using existing wiring coaxial cable telephone line power line
The defining characteristic LAN contrast WAN include higher limited geographic range lack reliance provide connectivity
Current Ethernet LAN technology operate data transfer rate standarized
Currently developed
A LAN connected WAN using
A HAN residential LAN used communication digital device typically deployed home usually small number personal computer accessory printer mobile computing device
An important function sharing Internet access often broadband service cable TV DSL provider
A SAN dedicated network provides access consolidated block level data storage
SANs primarily used make storage device disk array tape library optical jukebox accessible server device appear like locally attached device operating system
A SAN typically network storage device generally accessible local area network device
The cost complexity SANs dropped early level allowing wider adoption across enterprise small business environment
A CAN made interconnection LANs within limited geographical area
The networking equipment switch router transmission medium optical fiber copper plant cabling etc
almost entirely owned campus tenant owner enterprise university government etc
For example university campus network likely link variety campus building connect academic college department library student residence hall
A part computer network infrastructure provides path exchange information different LANs
A backbone tie together diverse network within building across different building wide area
For example large company might implement backbone network connect department located around world
The equipment tie together departmental network constitutes network backbone
When designing network backbone critical factor take account
Normally backbone network capacity greater individual network connected
Another example backbone network set WANs tie together network connected
A MAN large computer network usually span city large campus
A WAN computer network cover large geographic area city country span even intercontinental distance
A WAN us communication channel combine many type medium telephone line cable air wave
A WAN often make use transmission facility provided common carrier telephone company
WAN technology generally function lower three layer
An network single organization build interconnect office location production site head office remote office shop share computer resource
A VPN overlay network link node carried open connection virtual circuit larger network Internet instead physical wire
The data link layer protocol virtual network said tunneled larger network case
One common application secure communication public Internet VPN need explicit security feature authentication content encryption
VPNs example used separate traffic different user community underlying network strong security feature
VPN may performance may defined service level agreement SLA VPN customer VPN service provider
Generally VPN topology complex
A GAN network used supporting mobile across arbitrary number wireless LANs satellite coverage area etc
The key challenge mobile communication handing user communication one local coverage area next
In IEEE Project involves succession terrestrial
Networks typically managed organization
Private enterprise network may use combination intranet extranets
They may also provide network access single owner permit virtually unlimited global connectivity
An set network control single administrative entity
The intranet us protocol tool web browser file transfer application
The administrative entity limit use intranet authorized user
Most commonly intranet internal LAN organization
A large intranet typically least one web server provide user organizational information
An intranet also anything behind router local area network
An network also administrative control single organization support limited connection specific external network
For example organization may provide access aspect intranet share data business partner customer
These entity necessarily trusted security standpoint
Network connection extranet often always implemented via WAN technology
An connection multiple computer network via common routing technology using router
The largest example internetwork
It global system interconnected governmental academic corporate public private computer network
It based networking technology
It successor ARPANET developed
The Internet also communication backbone underlying WWW
Participants Internet use diverse array method several hundred documented often standardized protocol compatible Internet Protocol Suite addressing system administered
Service provider large enterprise exchange information address space BGP forming redundant worldwide mesh transmission path
A overlay network typically running internet accessible specialized software
A darknet anonymizing network connection made trusted peer sometimes called friend using
Darknets distinct distributed network anonymous publicly shared therefore user communicate little fear governmental corporate interference
process selecting network path carry network traffic
Routing performed many kind network including network
In packet switched network routing directs transit logically addressed source toward ultimate destination intermediate
Intermediate node typically network hardware device
also forward packet perform routing though specialized hardware may suffer limited performance
The routing process usually directs forwarding basis maintain record route various network destination
Thus constructing routing table held router important efficient routing
There usually multiple route taken choose different element considered decide route get installed routing table sorted priority Most routing algorithm use one network path time
technique enable use multiple alternative path
Routing narrow sense term often contrasted assumption structured similar address imply proximity within network
Structured address allow single routing table entry represent route group device
In large network structured addressing routing narrow sense outperforms unstructured addressing bridging
Routing become dominant form addressing Internet
Bridging still widely used within localized environment
application hosted computer network member user network help network operate
The example network service
Network service DNS give name people remember name like better number like ensure equipment network valid IP address
Services usually based defines format sequencing message client server network service
Depending installation requirement usually measured telecommunication product
The parameter affect typically include
The following list give example network performance measure network one type viz
ATM There many way measure performance network network different nature design
Performance also modelled instead measured
For example often used model queuing performance network
The network planner us diagram analyze network performs state ensuring network optimally designed
occurs link node carrying much data deteriorates
Typical effect include new connection
A consequence latter two incremental increase lead either small increase network actual reduction network throughput
use aggressive compensate packet loss tend keep system state network initial load reduced level would normally induce network congestion
Thus network using protocol exhibit two stable state level load
The stable state low throughput known
Modern network use technique try avoid congestion collapse
These include protocol original reduction device
Another method avoid negative effect network congestion implementing priority scheme packet transmitted higher priority others
Priority scheme solve network congestion help alleviate effect congestion service
An example
A third method avoid network congestion explicit allocation network resource specific flow
One example use Transmission Opportunities CFTXOPs standard provides existing home wire power line phone line coaxial cable
For Internet address subject congestion control detail
ability provide maintain acceptable level face challenge normal consists provision policy adopted prevent monitor access misuse modification denial computer network resource
Network security authorization access data network controlled network administrator
Users assigned ID password allows access information program within authority
Network security used variety computer network public private secure daily transaction communication among business government agency individual
monitoring data transferred computer network
The monitoring often done surreptitiously may done behest government corporation criminal organization individual
It may may legal may may require authorization court independent agency
Computer network surveillance program widespread today almost Internet traffic could potentially monitored clue illegal activity
Surveillance useful government maintain recognize monitor threat activity
With advent program program technology software law government posse unprecedented ability monitor activity citizen
However many expressed concern increasing surveillance citizen may lead society limited political personal freedom
Fears led numerous lawsuit
The group hacked government website protest considers draconian surveillance
paradigm uninterrupted protection data traveling two communicating party
It involves originating party data intended recipient decrypt dependency third party
encryption prevents intermediary discovering tampering communication
encryption generally protects
Examples encryption include radio
Typical communication system include encryption
These system guarantee protection communication communicating party
Examples system
Some system example LavaBit SecretInk even described offering encryption
Some system normally offer encryption turned contain subverts negotiation communicating party example
The encryption paradigm directly address risk communication endpoint poor quality
also address relates thing identity end point time quantity message sent
Users network administrator typically different view network
Users share printer server workgroup usually mean geographic location LAN whereas Network Administrator responsible keep network running
A le connection local area thought set arbitrarily located user share set server possibly also communicate via technology
Network administrator see network physical logical perspective
The physical perspective involves geographic location physical cabling network element interconnect via transmission medium
Logical network called architecture map onto one transmission medium
For example common practice campus building make set LAN cable building appear common subnet using technology
Both user administrator aware varying extent trust scope characteristic network
Again using architectural terminology community interest private administration usually enterprise accessible authorized user
employee
Intranets connected Internet generally limited connection
An extension intranet allows secure communication user outside intranet
business partner customer
Unofficially Internet set user enterprise content provider interconnected ISP
From engineering viewpoint set subnets aggregate subnets share registered space exchange information reachability IP address using
Typically name server translated IP address transparently user via directory function DNS
Over Internet communication
When money sensitive information exchanged communication apt protected form mechanism
Intranets extranets securely superimposed onto Internet without access general Internet user administrator using secure VPN technology

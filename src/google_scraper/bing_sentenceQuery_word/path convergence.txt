Both Russia United States industrialized nation
Can think cultural norm share
state nation transition beginning stage industrialization highly industrialized nation societal pattern emerge eventually creating global culture
Early convergence theorist believed even country polar opposite view economic development like communist capitalist nation develop along path
Some promoter convergence theory Russian dissident human right activist nuclear physicist advocated development convergence theory way lessen tension Russia United States
In convergence theory closely related
This theory state nation develop take path industrialization similar one Western nation took
Both convergence theory modernization theory examined link economic development societal change
Those supported theory thought phenomenon would due part technological development
From see throughout history nation become industrialized interdependent become
The interdependent become similar cultural norm become
Think nation Fortune company
In order company function need develop network supplier distributor order successful
The also said u
Technology industrialization changed u biggest change become
In word depend others thing like growing food building shelter
Just technology industrialization led u develop network dependent upon others standard living survival nation image grow food make clothes
There would time finer thing life like using SodaStream watching TV
Convergence theory also known effect
Convergence theorist believe entering era nation industrialized interdependent similar culture
They believe lead fewer war
According convergence theorist Third World country also increase standard living decrease rate poverty
In word catch industrialized nation hence name effect
An example would People Republic China went one poorest country world world highest GDP according source
Get FREE access day create account
Detractors convergence theory noted early theorist failed examine possibility advancement technology nothing economic social development
Recent convergence theorist address issue clarifying belief
They noted industrialized nation develop similarity aspect area use similar technology daily life individual
Developing country People Republic China India great example recent convergence theory practice
Both country experienced rapid economic technological growth
However growth significantly changed cultural identity
Daily life India People Republic China United States still varies greatly even enjoying similarity availability Western brand restaurant McDonald Starbucks
However traditional value taste still dominant India People Republic China
For instance India controversial caste system influence hiring practice job placement
Furthermore Hinduism predominant religion India
A part Hindu religion belief cow eaten therefore McDonald India carry beef
In China McDonald tends carry different item American counterpart retaining many cultural staple like rice beef vegetable sometimes packed known Rice McWrap
Let review main point lesson
theory explores concept nation transition highly industrialized nation develop similar cultural trait
closely related
Beliefs theory state Recent convergence theory noted industrialized nation alike aspect area
Though industrialized nation similar technology use often retain unique culture

A general form specifies unique location
A path point file system location following directory tree hierarchy expressed path component separated delimiting character represent directory
The delimiting character commonly character colon though may use different
Paths used extensively represent relationship common modern operating system essential construction URLs
Resources represented either
Multics first introduced hierarchical file system directory separated
Around Unix introduced slash character directory separator
In first version Microsoft DOS released
support file directory
Also major portion utility command packaged came IBM command line syntax used slash character prefix
For example run command wide list format option
This use slash still found command interface Windows
By contrast Unix us dash character command line switch prefix
When directory support added version kept switch prefix character backwards compatibility
Microsoft chose backslash character directory separator look similar slash character
An path point location file system regardless current
To must include
By contrast path start given working directory avoiding need provide full absolute path
A considered relative path based current working directory
If working directory file result file addressed name
note also used reference root current user library current working directory respectively
When filesystems filename extension mounted
character changed example
note prefix may number boot volume AppleShare home directory Japanese Korean version Windows may often display character character instead directory separator
In case code backslash drawn character
Very early version replaced backslash glyph display make possible display program understood character square bracket replaced well see
Although even first version Windows supported character set Yen sign modern version Windows support Won sign much software continue display backslashes found ASCII file way preserve backwards compatibility
derivative UNIX us UNIX path internally
However preserve compatibility software familiarity user many portion GUI switch typed user internally switch back displaying filename entered user also changed inverse translation happen
The Microsoft Windows short specifies common syntax describe location network resource shared file directory printer
The UNC syntax Windows system generic form Microsoft often refers
Some Microsoft Windows interface also allow require UNC syntax share access rather URL
The UNC syntax extended optional component denote use SSL port number WebDAV URL becomes When viewed remotely SharedFolder may name different program server see opening
Instead SharedFolder name consists arbitrary name assigned folder defining sharing
Some Microsoft Windows interface also accept Long UNC Microsoft Windows us following type path In version Windows prior Windows XP APIs accept Long UNC could accept character
The allows path name character long
Since UNCs start two backslashes backslash also used string escaping result extreme case escaped string regular expression matching UNC begin backslashes string regular expression require escaping
This simplified using C Python regular expression literal Perl
Most system use similar syntax
allows treating path beginning two slash manner though case system must treat multiple slash single slash
Many application system example use resource definition like service name The following worked example discus behavior would appear terminal terminal application window Attached current working directory cwd One want change current working directory At moment desired represented short absolute path directory Given relative path directory wanted following may typed change current working directory bobapples Two dot point upwards indicate one dot represents current directory
Both component complex relative path alone first component relative path represents
Using refer file current working directory sometimes usefully distinguish resource found default directory mean example view specific version instead one installed system
Contrary popular belief accepts slash thus Unix example work
But many application Windows interpret slash purpose treat invalid character thus require enter backslash notably shell often called terminal typically run terminal window
Note many shell available Windows allow slash
In addition indicate single root instead root current disk
Indicating file disk current one requires prefixing drive letter colon
No ambiguity ensues colon valid character filename thus one file called A current directory
UNC name path starting support slash
The following example show path backslashes used match common syntax This path point file name located directory turn located root directory drive
This path refers file called located parent directory current directory drive
This path denotes file called located directory turn located directory located current directory current drive since example give
This rather simple path point file named located current directory since path lack current drive since drive specification present
This path refers first
This example us path containing slash directory separator
The command redirects content file command
A path containing forward slash often need surrounded double quote disambiguate
CD drive letter Files work root drive letter directory
This appears treat forward slash
For example work Also root folder would treated If relative path directory name specified forward slash get following error For setting environment variable sometimes necessary provide path contain space instance defined C cause script halt encounter space path name
To get name Windows assigns directory substitution environment variable use directory listing command option one level target directory
For instance following get eight character name directory directly root

Convergence coming together two different entity context computing technology integration two different technology single device system
A good example convergence communication imaging technology mobile device designed make call take picture two unrelated technology converge single device
Convergence considered new trend technological capability recently established allow cheaper widespread implementation
The simple concept convergence allows multiple task performed single device effectively conserve space power
For example rather carrying separate device like cell phone camera digital organizer technology converges single device smartphone
Another good example surfing Internet TV HDTV

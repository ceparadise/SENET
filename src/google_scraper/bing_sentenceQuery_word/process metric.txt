Schedule Variance Any difference scheduled completion activity actual completion known Schedule Variance
Schedule variance Actual calendar day Planned calendar day Start variance Planned calendar day x
Effort Variance Difference planned outlined effort effort required actually undertake task called Effort variance
Effort variance Actual Effort Planned Effort Planned Effort x
Size Variance Difference estimated size project actual size project normally KLOC FP
Size variance Actual size Estimated size Estimated size x
Requirement Stability Index Provides visibility magnitude impact requirement change
RSI No changed No deleted No added Total Initial requirement

Productivity Project It measure output related process unit input
Project Productivity Actual Project Size Actual effort expended project
Productivity test case preparation Actual test Actual effort expended test case preparation

Productivity test case execution Actual number test case actual effort expended testing

Productivity defect detection Actual number defect review testing actual effort spent review testing

Productivity defect fixation actual defect actual effort spent defect fixation

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

The metric scale system measurement used metric system
Unlike customary system measurement United States metric scale unit based multiple
For example United States distance measurement one foot equal inch three foot equal one yard foot equal one mile
In metric scale centimeter equal one decimeter decimeter equal one meter meter equal one kilometer
Different metric scale exist different type measurement
The meter metric scale unit length gram metric scale unit mass weight divided force gravity liter metric scale unit volume
The unit metric scale prefix indicate magnitude measured unit relation base unit
These prefix include milli centi deci kilo unit
With unit prefix unit magnitude measurement expressed determined
For example millimeter meter milligram gram milliliter liter
A kilometer meter
In France commissioned Academy Science create simple measurement system metric system became compulsory France
By nation adopted metric system
The United States act related metric system Metric Study Act metric system remains recommended mandatory system measurement
Instead country
us
Customary System Measurements based English system weight measure country use
In United States product labeling retail product includes metric United States system especially product grocery store
Tech product computer smartphones example state screen size inch storage speed spec metric unit
The metric unit established metric scale standardized length mass volume also scientific measurement
For example ampere metric unit used indicate magnitude electrical current candela used quantify magnitude light intensity
These unit also expressed prefix
One advantage metric scale easier user perform calculation
For instance easily accomplish conversion kilometer meter divide
In United States convert mile foot divide
Not conversion factor difficult remember conversion often requires calculator
United States scientist engineer use metric system scientist engineer part world use metric system English system

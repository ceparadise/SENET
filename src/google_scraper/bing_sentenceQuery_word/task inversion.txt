Let u first put priority inversion context Big Picture
come
In Operating System one important concept Task Scheduling
There several Scheduling method First Come First Serve Round Robin Priority based scheduling etc
Each scheduling method pro con
As might guessed Priority Inversion come Priority based Scheduling
Basically problem arises sometimes Priority based scheduling used OS
In Priority based scheduling different task given different priority higher priority task intervene lower priority task possible
So priority based scheduling lower priority task L running higher priority task H also need run lower priority task L would preempted higher priority task H
Now suppose lower higher priority task need share common resource say access file device achieve respective work
In case since resource sharing task synchronization needed several used handling scenario
For sake topic Priority Inversion let u mention synchronization method say mutex
Just recap mutex task acquires mutex entering critical section CS release mutex exiting critical section CS
While running CS task access common resource
More detail referred
Now say L H share common Critical Section CS
mutex needed CS
Coming discussion priority inversion let u examine scenario
L running CS H need run H preempt L H start running H relinquishes release control L resume start running L running CS H need run CS H preempt L H start running H relinquishes control L resume start running
L running CS H also need run CS H wait L come CS L come CS H enters CS start running Please note scenario show problem Priority Inversion even scenario
Basically long lower priority task running shared CS higher priority task preempt
But L running shared CS H also need run CS H wait L come CS
The idea CS small enough result H waiting long time L CS
That writing CS code requires careful consideration
In scenario priority inversion
reversal priority occur task running per design
Now let u add another task middle priority say Now task priority order L M In example M share Critical Section CS
In case following sequence task running would result Priority Inversion problem
L running CS H also need run CS H wait L come CS M interrupt L start running M run till completion relinquishes control L resume start running till end CS H enters CS start running
Note neither L H share CS Here see running M delayed running L Precisely speaking H higher priority share CS M H wait This Priority based scheduling work expected priority M H got inverted spite sharing CS
This problem called Priority Inversion
This heck Priority Inversion
In system priority based scheduling higher priority task face problem result unexpected
In general purpose OS result slower performance
In RTOS result severe outcome
The famous Priority Inversion problem happened Mars Pathfinder
If problem solution
For Priority Inversion well different solution Priority Inheritance etc
This going next article But inpatient referred time

In problematic scenario high priority indirectly lower priority task effectively inverting relative priority two task
This violates priority model high priority task prevented running higher priority task briefly low priority task quickly complete use resource shared high low priority task
Consider two task high low priority respectively either acquire exclusive use shared resource
If attempt acquire acquired becomes blocked relinquishes resource
Sharing resource case system typically involves relinquishing promptly higher priority task stay blocked excessive period time
Despite good design however possible third task medium priority represents priority task becomes runnable use
At point higher priority preempt causing able relinquish promptly turn causing highest priority unable run
This called higher priority task preempted lower priority one
In case priority inversion occur without causing immediate delayed execution high priority task go unnoticed eventually low priority task release shared resource
However also many situation priority inversion cause serious problem
If high priority task left resource might lead system malfunction triggering corrective measure resetting entire system
The trouble experienced Mars lander classic example problem caused priority inversion system
Priority inversion also reduce system
Low priority task usually low priority important finish promptly example might another activity
Similarly high priority task high priority likely subject strict time may providing data interactive user acting subject realtime response guarantee
Because priority inversion result execution lower priority task blocking high priority task lead reduced system responsiveness even violation response time guarantee
A similar problem called occur within EDF
The existence problem known since
Lampson Redell published one first paper point priority inversion problem
Systems UNIX kernel already addressing problem splx primitive
There foolproof method predict situation
There however many existing solution common one

This Find number inversion array
I guess mean O N log N since sorting complexity
The answer summarized follows Modify modify count inversion two sorted array run regular modified
Does make sense
Are maybe simpler solution
Is hard phone interview
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
It actually application algorithm familiar come solution quickly
Take example assume sorted array need combine two array get number total inversion
Since already number inversion need find number inversion caused array merging
Each time element inserted example inserted know many inversion first array element pair example
Then add get number inversion caused merging
You could also use counting approach array contains small number example like character array Basically keep count many time element appears
Then step number inversion th element generates equal sum element bigger come easily compute using count keeping
This domain element array
This definitely simpler opinion
As efficiency good small obviously
If faster approach since recursion

competitive programming question You number chore
You one chore time depend others
Suppose four task complete
For convenience assume task numbered
Suppose task depends task task task depends task
One possible sequence complete given task sequence task attempted task depends
The sequence would allowed task depends task task scheduled task
In example check exactly three possible sequence compatible dependency
In case N task numbered N dependency task
You calculate number way reorder N task sequence violate dependency
Task Dependency NA
I inferred following Then trial error listing possibility two separate part sequence I got possibility
However larger set data deduction would easy
What way calculate logically find number possibility integrated program
I tried represent question clearly possible visit link view question Q
No I high school student preparing programming competition I taken many course algorithm design might trivial question please excuse
It good question certainly trivial
This problem essentially counting number
A topological basically valid ordering completing task
According put comment mean hard actually compute large number task dependency
They expecting write program small number task give
You probably need
try possible order check valid count
Alternatively smart variation brute force enumerating possible topological ordering counting
Frequently type question asked competition You also take look
To run would make dependency graph input task count topological ordering using algorithm paper
I sure would finish time input data one way know would try

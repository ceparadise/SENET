Wise strategic use computer information technology give business competitive advantage help government agency serve client efficiently well
information system become critical organization strategy surrounding integral organization broader strategy
Because professional field typically demand educational program like Information Systems major traditionally enjoyed strong direct link field professional community
Information system field academic study began year first use computer information processing organization
As organization extended use information technology operational process decision support competitive strategy academic field also grew scope depth
During period growth change different name gained lost currency definition field enlarged
The simple term information system IS become commonly accepted generic term describe discipline
Still academic field go host label reflecting historical development various perspective emphasis among information system expert teacher
Here term As academic field Information Systems encompasses two broad area As information system expert would share broad responsibility develop implement manage infrastructure information technology computer communication data internal external system track new information technology help incorporate organization strategy planning practice support departmental individual information technology system
As science Computer Science primarily concerned discovering new knowledge strong foundation theory selected application domain
The field basis software engineering chemistry form basis chemical engineering physic basis electrical engineering
Some important topic science theory data structure algorithm programming language network operating system compiler database architecture artificial intelligence robotics graphic
The computer science program Saint Michael strong emphasis software development software engineering
To better understand emphasis consider following definition Engineering building useful product real people development solution technical problem within economic social technical constraint condition uncertainty

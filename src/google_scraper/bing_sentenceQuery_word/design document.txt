If embark task developing Master thesis Computer Science document may interest
The scope document narrow deal certain feature thesis development unique field Computer Science
For general information consult source Strunk White Turabian University guide thesis preparation
Before get heart matter ask background skill required successfully complete thesis Computer Science
The next section list skill expected posse
While hard fast rule guarantee background skill required complete thesis Computer Science indicator
Here list indicator
Most thesis Computer Science consist two distinct part writing significant program writing paper describes program wrote
The intent document guide two thing
Of course need taken certain course read certain book journal article otherwise perform basic research begin writing program thesis
If thesis involve writing program skip section
Presumably thesis topic time start developing program implement demonstrate idea topic
You learned write program previous course usually program write thesis involved program written
Thus important use good software engineering technique
The requirement document explains program
Often requirement quite vague
For example system must fast system must
You want write set requirement serve contract specifying expected program
What requirement document
Abstractly answer simple statement valid input program statement corresponding output
Your software operate data derive computed data
The requirement document clearly state input data output data
The requirement document tell program perspective
The specification document explains requirement precisely requirement document
It restates requirement point view developer
The specification explicitly precisely stated
They statement design test
Essentially specification define function set possible data input data output program
The preliminary design document explains going fulfill specification
It written write program include list algorithm use major data structure list major function step use develop program
Stepwise refinement information hiding concept used developing program producing detailed design document
Understanding comment code important
Comments help understand done
It backwards write code try explain
Basic rule include giving selection iteration statement well block sequential code
Additionally loop invariant need developed iteration statement
Data structure use also need explained
Additional document sometimes required program
These include user manual maintenance manual test suite
Often appear appendix thesis
The user manual describes user interface program
The maintenance manual describes change augment port program
The test suite offer validation program compute intended describing test procedure sample test input
Most likely others use program
Writing good user manual facilitate use program
The important thing write naive user
It best assume user program know nothing computer interface
A clear concise description one us program great value others well
You identify awkward misleading command correcting develop much usable product
Start requirement document remind program
If work lasting benefit someone want extend functionality code
A well maintenance manual assist explaining code
The maintenance manual grows specification preliminary design detailed design document
The manual show program decomposed module specifies interface module list major data structure control structure
It also specify effective scope change code
How guarantee program meet specification
Formal verification one proof technique difficult apply large program
You familiar verification technique use develop code others still going want see code give expected result sample test case
Thus develop test suite used show program work correctly variety condition specifying testing procedure used variety test case exercise component program
I believe program written read understood person experienced programming
The basic method facilitating human consumption program write good internal comment discussed
Much sophisticated method exist one system developed Don Knuth
The original system written Pascal system language written even program called used generate system programming language
Briefly benefit using system enables develop program logically without constraint imposed compiler provide excellent program documentation modularity track variable module automatically
An index variable module produced containing pointer variable module defined used
To learn system refer cited literature
Your thesis paper document work serve basis publishable paper
The common mistake made thesis student assume thesis easy write
Consequently postpone writing completed programming
By time produce acceptable copy find term two school slipped still graduated
Important advice start writing early ask thesis advisor feedback writing
Equally important
Plagiarism result expulsion school
You expected write paper copy someone else written
It okay use people idea even word must clearly reference work
Your paper describe
Everyone make spelling mistake spelling checker program available type error eliminated
Always run written work spelling checker ask someone else read
Also find someone correct grammatical mistake paper
If necessary hire someone English Department Language Institute correct work give advisor
Also use professional document preparation system example WordPerfect allows print document laser printer
There
thesis style file developed produce correct margin format plus automatically handle many detail preparation thesis
You begin writing paper first quarter enrolled thesis credit
You write thesis proposal evolves thesis
Writing good proposal important first step success
Proposals differ certain thing expected found every one
There need statement problem studied previous work problem software requirement goal study outline proposed work set milestone bibliography
The approach recommended program development carry development thesis paper
Here begin outline chapter
Although difficult specify included chapter thesis following outline fairly general
Your finished thesis must include title page signature page abstract bibliography
See University guide thesis preparation detail
Make sure follow margin format requirement exactly
You proud work want others know
One way show done quality work publish journal present conference
Thus write short page paper concisely explains new important
This paper submitted appropriate conference journal
The research done provide list conference journal submit work
Below quick list guideline discussed document
There several local requirement aware unnecessary problem completing thesis
Many procedure policy described document simply summarized
If simply follow suggestion outlined discussed paper well way successfully completing thesis requirement attainment Master Degree Computer Science Florida Institute Technology

term rule forming term particular field art science
Nomenclature system assignment name given organic compound
The principle naming vary relatively informal everyday speech internationally agreed principle rule recommendation govern formation use specialist term used scientific discipline
Naming thing part general human using aspect everyday people distinguish object experience together similarity difference observer name
The use name many different kind embedded different language connects nomenclature way human mentally structure world relation relates
study origin includes concerned human name including study place name derivation history use name revealed
The scientific need simple stable internationally accepted system naming object natural world generated many formal nomenclatural system
Probably best known nomenclatural system five code govern
The word nomenclature derived call Latin term refers list name word also indicate provider announcer name
The study proper known scope encompassing name language geographical cultural region
The distinction onomastics nomenclature readily clear onomastics unfamiliar discipline people use nomenclature academic sense also commonly known
Although two field integrate nomenclature concern rule convention used formation name
Same thing may given different name different thing may given name due social political religious cultural motivation
Closely related similar thing may considered separate hand considerably different thing might considered due contextual reason example closely related mutually intelligible language versus language favored separate language respectively seen context resulting mutually unintelligible speech variety differ considerably structure considered language due
Names provide u way structuring world way mirror represent object experience
Elucidating connection language especially name noun meaning way perceive world provided rich field study
Relevant area study include distinction proper name proper noun relationship name referent meaning structure language
Modern scientific taxonomy described Formal scientific nomenclatural classification system exemplified
All system established purpose
The scientific classification system anchor organism within internationally accepted classification category
Maintenance system involves formal rule nomenclature periodic international meeting review
This modern system evolved
Folk taxonomy illustrated Western tradition horticulture gardening
Unlike scientific taxonomy folk taxonomy serve many purpose
Examples horticulture would grouping plant naming group according property us nature life cycle culinary use growth habit wild cultivated plant whether managed whether considered nuisance
Folk taxonomy generally associated way rural indigenous people use language make sense organise object around
frame interpretation either utilitarianists like maintain name classification reflect mainly material concern intellectualists like hold spring innate mental process
The literature classification reviewed
Folk classification defined way member language community name categorize plant animal whereas refers hierarchical structure organic content cultural function biological classification ethnobiologists find every society around world
Ethnographic study naming classification animal plant society revealed general principle indicate man conceptual linguistic method organising biological world hierarchical way
Such study indicate urge classify basic human instinct
The level moving least inclusive In almost culture object named using one two word equivalent kind genus particular kind specie
When made two word name usually consists noun like adjectival second word help describe first therefore make name whole specific example
The meaning noun used common name may lost forgotten common name extended two word much conveyed organism use appearance special property
These binomial like name family surname like another adjectival Christian forename name specifies Simpson say
It seems reasonable assume form scientific name call derived simple practical way constructing common name use Latin universal language
In keeping utilitarianist view author maintain ethnotaxonomies resemble complex web resemblance neat hierarchy
A name label
Names identify class thing single thing either uniquely within given
Names given example name even
It name noun building block nomenclature
The word name possibly derived hypothesised word
The distinction name noun made extremely subtle although clearly noun refers name function within context language rather label object property
Human presented used categorised many way depending language culture
In culture Indonesia one exception customary individual given least two name
In Western culture first name given birth shortly thereafter referred given simply
In England prior Norman invasion small community generally used single name person identified single name either personal name
As population increased gradually became necessary identify people giving rise name like John butcher Henry Sutton Roger son Richard naturally evolved John Butcher Henry Sutton Roger Richardson
We know additional name variously occasionally natural tendency accelerated Norman tradition using surname fixed hereditary within individual family
In combination two name known personal name simply name
There many exception general rule Westerners often insert third name given surname Chinese Hungarian name family name preceding given name female often retain maiden name family surname combine using hyphen maiden name surname husband East Slavic nation insert patronym name derived given name father given family name Iceland given name used patronym matronym name derived given name mother surname rarely used
sometimes called name informal name used mostly friend
The distinction proper name denote unique entity
common name used general sense reference class object

Many proper name obscure meaning lack apparent meaning way ordinary word mean probably practical reason consist refer group even inflected
committee
like cabbage refer physical body observed least one sens like love hate refer abstract object
In English many abstract noun formed adding suffix adjective verb
happiness serenity concentration
like stand place noun
The capitalization noun varies language even particular context journal often common name
Distinctions may made particular kind name simply using suffix Greek ὄνομα ónoma
So example name body water name meaning
The entire field could described chrematonymy name thing
Toponyms name given place feature particular district region etc
This could include planet country city town village building etc
divided specialist branch hodonymy name street road like name water body oronomy name mountain
Toponymy popular appeal historical interest significance
However work etymology toponym found many place name descriptive honorific commemorative frequently meaning meaning obscure lost
Also many category name frequently interrelated
For example many derived personal name Victoria many name planet star derived name character many personal name derived name nation like Wood Bridge
In biological science least nomenclature regarded part though distinct taxonomy
defined study including principle procedure rule classification ordering object classification group based similarity difference
Doing taxonomy entail describing naming nomenclature strict scientific sense branch taxonomy concerned application scientific name taxon based particular classification scheme accordance agreed international rule convention
Identification determines whether particular organism match taxon already classified named classification must precede identification
This procedure sometimes referred determination
The precision demanded science accurate naming object natural world resulted variety international nomenclatural code
Although system rapidly adopted publication respectively long time international consensus concerning general rule governing
The first botanical code produced zoological code cultivated plant code
Agreement nomenclature symbol gene emerged
Over last hundred year number identified astronomical object risen hundred billion discovered every year
Astronomers need universal systematic designation unambiguously identify object using assigning name interesting object relevant naming important interesting feature object
The system naming describing science general
It maintained
The rule naming printed two publication available A third publication contains recommendation use association fourth defines large number technical term used chemistry
Similar compendia exist association
These book supplemented shorter recommendation specific circumstance published time time
These system accessed
The classic English translation includes appendix Appendix C detailing problem nomenclature

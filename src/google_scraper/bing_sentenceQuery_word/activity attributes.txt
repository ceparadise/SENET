In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Get FREE access day create account
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

My district starting school two week earlier year
I thinking I could use extra day I gained AP test
I want activity beginning school year engage student introduce computer science
To find activity I course performed Internet search
I noticed First Day Activities CSTA blog post Leigh Ann August
That I titled post First Day Activities Revisited
In post Leigh Ann describes first day activity follows After paper airplane built I engage student discussion process asking question Does order gave direction matter
What difficult thing able talk
Would helpful get feedback process progressing far
Hint subtle reminder writing program piece compiling go along rather trying
I refer back activity throughout year common experience I frame part code compile run refactor process
Baker Franke responded Leigh Ann post first day activity One first day activity I done past year one Dean Johnson Fort Atkinson High School Wisconsin suggested
You bag candy pas group
I allow student group
The condition I place group group must four fewer student
I tell student dump candy onto desk
The first question I ask student What characteristic candy
We short discussion characteristic student suggest
Then I student group think characteristic use sort candy
I write piece paper sort candy
After group sorted candy group share characteristic
I repeat process
The group third time
I group turn write ups
I referred back activity discussing attribute relation class object
Last week I attended Crafton Hills College Yucaipa CA
As professor discussing definition computer science I thought another activity I could first day using reference discussed
I would student work pair computer science
After finished pair would share definition
Using reference workshop I would student go online summarize definition different source compare contrast definition definition looked
Then discus found
One possible first day activity I found Twitter Robots Game
Stuart Wray Senior Lecturer Royal School Signals Blandford England describes game maze blog http He board every six player six robot piece number
The six player divided two team
Each player writes move onto
One person roll dice determine robot start first executes move
The others follow numeric order
For robot owner read move move sheet another player executes move
A robot move one square forward backward instruction turn left right without move direction
If another robot square robot whose turn move occupied location stationary robot moved one space way
The player continue move robot using move sheet robot reach exit square
The first team robot exit square win
Wray say game point student relationship game programming
The move blindly executed like computer execute code without thinking
I looking first day activity
What first day activity successful
Myra Deister CSTA Representative Thank Myra
I ready first day wo filling book card passing book going classroom procedure year blah
I also may throw icebreaker activity I credit Barb Ericson student write name hobby one thing fun piece paper
Then crumple throw around room
After toss everyone pick one
Then person starting read person paper read person next read
Posted Susan Recoon Cool Activity
I also enjoyable
First day class really memorable
I also experience share
Haha
Thanks sharing

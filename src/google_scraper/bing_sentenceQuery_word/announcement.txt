arlier week First Daughter Ivanka Trump President Department Education invest million grant funding annually expand access STEM computer science education public school
Tech company followed immediately additional
As advocate STEM CS education I thrilled commitment coming highest level federal government
But given administration track record race poverty education human right announcement viewed skepticism
It impossible overstate importance computer science education building future workforce providing economic opportunity
Technology massive driver economy computing knowledge becoming foundational knowledge needed across occupation sector
When group student shut pathway fastest growing occupation becomes civil right issue equity issue
So clearly increasing access CS course public school important first step
But committed training diverse future STEM computing workforce critical economy got take holistic approach
The publicly available detail initiative remain murky
But Million dollar question Will investment actually benefit underrepresented student color
To get bottom applauding announcement asking several critical question This White House memo creating new source funding reallocates fund existing budget
We need understand whether existing grant program cut order fund initiative specifically affect existing grant program provide resource Title I school district improve teacher preparation narrow gap access quality teaching address achievement gap facing student color
In teleconference Trump signaled gender would prioritized initiative give even passing mention racial disparity leaving u assume talking white woman Sure one example one offered
Here important relevant stats The specific program yet concretized
That fine understandable
Department Education grant project normally subject public comment period allowing crucial input expert stakeholder talking Trump White House unclear past norm guide administration process
Three hundred million dollar significant investment
But need know computer science education strategy activity prioritized
It unclear much funding form new investment grant opposed simply quantifying existing grant school district software donation volunteer technical support
Beyond investment education tech industry must also address culture
Until bias disparity recruitment hiring promotion leadership pay addressed amount investment pipeline make tech workforce le male White
And without clear pathway tech job rest workforce continue lose economic opportunity wealth creation simply based color skin gender zip code
Achieving access every student regardless gender race income school zip code important first step expanding opportunity STEM computing education
To achieve though got pay close attention closing racial socioeconomic gap course availability focusing school teacher student greatest need
Yet simply making course available student actually first step student must also opportunity benefit course
This mean initiative must specifically aim increase underrepresented group course provide adequate introductory ensure student success course provide course curriculum would allow student rigorous class including Advanced Placement course lead success higher education workforce
For year Summer Math Science Honors SMASH Academy run STEM CS program underrepresented high school student color
We observed documented barrier rigorously experimented factor lead persistence STEM CS education among SMASH scholar
Access hugely important many factor impacting student outcome ranging access technology stereotype computing exposure role model income inequality
Here number insight effective strategy preparing SMASH student success STEM computing All say path preparing student particularly underrepresented student succeed persist STEM CS complicated nuanced important
The funding must utilized effective way meaningless best harmful worst
We also separate announcement political context
In better world STEM CS education could issue SMASH scholar underrepresented student directly impacted Trump Administration policy
They family affected Muslim ban live fear deportation traumatized administration condoning White supremacist terrorized school community rise hate crime left without recourse change guidance campus sexual assault
Computer science access funding never compensate destructive divisive impact policy
As Reshma Saujani vital piece This White House Computer Science announcement begin address real challenge creating STEM CS pathway student
It come close countering inequity facing student community color
And certainly compensate fear terror administration policy inflicted purport help
Students life lived vacuum
If administration interested helping create real STEM computer science opportunity student building diverse future workforce lot work done

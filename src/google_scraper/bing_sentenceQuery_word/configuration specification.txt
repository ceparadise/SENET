In definition computer program expected
It informal case considered blueprint user manual developer point view formal case definite meaning defined mathematical programmatic term
In practice successful specification written understand application already although software system often carefully specified prior application development
Specifications important external interface must remain stable
In system engineering specification document clearly accurately describes essential technical requirement item material service including procedure determined requirement met
Specifications help avoid duplication inconsistency allow accurate estimate necessary work resource act negotiation reference document engineering change provide documentation configuration allow consistent communication among responsible eight primary function Systems Engineering
They provide precise idea problem solved efficiently design system estimate cost design alternative
They provide guidance tester verification qualification technical requirement

In computing world people talk computer configuration referring technical specification tech spec computer
These spec typically include processor speed amount RAM hard drive space type video card machine
While many advanced specification could list know four mentioned computer geek grant acceptance conversation

You need computer make full use ResNet connection
See current requirement recommendation computer operating system
The following configuration recommended student intend keep computer four year without major upgrade solid state drive storage drive use traditional hard drive technology recording data magnetic disk meaning moving part
This make reliable faster le prone data loss dropping carrying laptop around
The downside solid state technology still expensive traditional hard drive technology space still limiting factor
If solid state drive purchased recommend also purchasing external hard drive data storage
Small lightweight computer reasonable processing power high build quality become popular last couple year suitable academic work
However many computer lack Ethernet port forcing rely wireless
If choose purchase We Below minimum required specification Windows computer used network
It recommended use computer campus meet specification
Computers meet minimum requirement receive limited support
The following configruation recommended student intend keep computer four year without major upgrade All current laptop offering Apple wired Ethernet port
As ResNet wireless coverage guaranteed common room purchase USB Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter use bedroom
Only iMac Mac Pro feature upgradable memory
If purchasing following computer able upgrade replace memory purchase
ResNet recommends maximizing memory configuration prior purchase Below minimum required specification Macintosh computer used network
It recommended use computer campus meet specification
Computers meet minimum requirement receive limited support
There minimum hardware requirement running Linux Unix
If get run congratulation
You must ensure operating system software kept date
Security update come Linux distribution daily
It responsibility stay top update ensure conformance importantly keep machine getting broken
Some common pitfall Linux machine configuration overlooked
A thing watch Additionally must configure firewall IPTables prevent unwanted connection
Linux available many different flavor known distros
A popular one Ubuntu hailed popular Linux distros today
It easiest install use Linux user versatile enough well
Recommended beginner advanced Linux user
A build Ubuntu making use clean user interface Linux Mint used operating system behind Windows OS X Ubuntu
Mint make use traditional user interface PC switcher may find useful
Gentoo throw head first Linux knowledge build system ground
Recommended intermediate advanced Linux user want learn lot run customized operating system
One longest running distribution Debian still active development release slowly Linux distros
It tends used server rather desktop
The commercial version Linux
You pay unlike many others come support
The open source free version SUSE Novell
Another commercial Linux distribution come support
Recommended Linux beginner

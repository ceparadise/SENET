Sorry advance question sound dumb As far I know building algorithm using dynamic programming work way As far I know I said everything dynamic programming
I mean dynamic programming give expressing recurrence relation turning code
So special dynamic programming
What give vague method approaching certain kind problem
Dynamic programming give way think algorithm design
This often helpful
Memoization method give turning recurrence relation code
Memoization relatively simple idea best idea often
Dynamic programming give structured way think running time algorithm
The running time basically determined two number number subproblems solve time take solve subproblem
This provides convenient easy way think algorithm design problem
When candidate recurrence relation look quickly get sense running time might instance often quickly tell many subproblems lower bound running time exponentially many subproblems solve recurrence probably wo good approach
This also help rule candidate subproblem decomposition
For instance string S defining subproblem prefix S suffix S substring S might reasonable number subproblems polynomial n defining subproblem subsequence S likely good approach number subproblems exponential n
This let prune search space possible recurrence
Dynamic programming give structured approach look candidate recurrence relation
Empirically approach often effective
In particular pattern recognize common way define subproblems depending type input
For instance If input n one candidate way define subproblem replacing n smaller integer n
n n
If input S candidate way define subproblem include replace S prefix S replace S suffix S replace S substring S
Here subproblem determined choice j
If input string
If input T one candidate way define subproblem replace T subtree T pick node x replace T subtree rooted x subproblem determined choice x
If input pair x recursively look type x type identify way choose subproblem
In word one candidate way define subproblem replace x x x subproblem x subproblem
You also consider subproblems form x x
And
This give useful heuristic looking method come list candidate way define subproblems
In word looking problem statement looking input come handful candidate way define subproblem
This often helpful
It tell recurrence relation particular choice define subproblem often hard work corresponding recurrence relation
So often turn design dynamic programming algorithm structured experience
You write scrap paper list candidate way define subproblems using heuristic
Then candidate try write recurrence relation evaluate running time counting number subproblems time spent per subproblem
After trying candidate keep best one able find
Providing structure algorithm design process major help otherwise algorithm design intimidating huge space possible approach without structure unclear even get started
Your understanding dynamic programming correct question justified
I think additional design space get kind recurrence call dynamic programming best seen comparison schema recursive approach
Let pretend input array A sake highlighting concept
Here idea make problem smaller solve smaller version derive solution original one
Schematically f A f A A g translates solution
Partition input several smaller part solve problem combine
Schematically two part f A f A f A
Shortest pairwise distance plane Consider way partitioning problem smaller problem pick best
Schematically two part f A best f A f A c
Edit distance problem
The application best every step reduces search space considerably
In sense know statically going top bottom make decision dynamically
The lesson learning dynamic programming try possible partitioning well required correctness still efficient using memoization
Dynamic Programming allows trade memory computation time
Consider classic example Fibonacci
Fibonacci defined recurrence Fib n
If solve using recursion end O call Fib since recursion tree binary tree height n
Instead want calculate Fib use find Fib use find Fib etc
This take O n time
DP also provides u basic technique translating recurrence relation solution relatively straightforward generally involve using dimensional matrix frontier matrix number parameter recurrence relation
These well explained text DP
Here another slightly different way phrasing dynamic programming give
Dynamic programming collapse exponential number candidate solution polynomial number equivalence class candidate solution class indistinguishable sense
Let take example problem finding number increasing subsequence length k array A lenght n
It useful partition set subsequence equivalence class two subsequence belong class length end index
All possible subsequence belong exactly one O equivalence class
This partitioning preserve enough information define recurrence relation size class
If f give number subsequence end index length f j A j A f j f n This recurrence solves problem time O

I keep hearing especially StackOverflow people generating webpage content dynamically
Does mean generating content anytime design time client side definition
In word relates web development definition dynamic
This mean generating HTML code PHP python etc
Instead hosting static HTML page generate HTML representative current state
As popular word people use mean many different thing
Static page really exist anymore
Any site care dynamic form
As result term got recycled mean number thing Everything involves part server transmit file harddisk
It refers possibility generation complete web page based content known available time scaffolding web page created
A dynamic web page give new information view maybe
For example static webpage always information dynamic web page content change depending specific variable like user logged etc
Values hard coded code form website
The value come number source including database content created user scraped website number place
Static content changed request dynamic content may changed depends time request parameter etc
Static content usually stored file like html cs image script etc
Dynamic content generated
Generation process usually us two part page template contains page markup special format placeholder dynamic part data obtained external source like database web service etc
Special application combine template data get final html content responded request
Dynamic content definition change gmail data different mine person u receive email regularly time atleast
A dynamic web page kind web page prepared fresh information content layout individual viewing
It static change time ex
news content user ex
preference login session user interaction ex
web page game context parametric customization
Ajax combine client server side dynamic data
Dynamically used mean content result generated fly
ahead time
generation follows kind process script function invoked
cached
using kind lookup case dynamic method object
statically

I heard many term like Dynamic binding Static binding Dynamic linking Static linking Dynamic loading
All I know term vocabulary dynamic mean runtime
But Dynamic Static
According dictionary dynamic something keep changing Happen runtime equal Something keep changing
I see point people using dynamic mean Happen runtime
Dynamic linking program dynamically linked number shared library modify library main program provided change interface
So yes library might keep changing
An example upgrade Linux typically get new version many system library
Dynamic binding work programming language support dynamic binding function call bound function body dynamically based argument function called upon

Can someone tell use algorithm trace question solved one
Thanks Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
An algorithm always take best immediate local solution finding answer
Greedy algorithm find overall globally optimal solution may find solution instance problem

Problems solved Greedy Algorithm two property Essentially Greedy Algorithms solve combinatorial problem property
For detail consult
Solve optimization problem caching subproblem solution memoization rather recomputing
Dynamic Programming algorithm often used optimization examine previously solved subproblems combine solution give best solution given problem
Now problem solved Dynamic Programming Algorithm necessary condition An optimal policy property whatever initial state initial decision remaining decision must constitute optimal policy regard state resulting first decision

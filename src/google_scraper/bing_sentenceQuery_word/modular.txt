Modular programming process subdividing computer program separate
A module separate software component
It often used variety application function component system
Similar function grouped unit programming code separate function developed separate unit code code reused application
programming OOP compatible modular programming concept large extent
Modular programming enables multiple programmer divide work debug piece program independently
Modules modular programming enforce logical boundary component improve maintainability
They incorporated interface
They designed way minimize dependency different module
Teams develop module separately require knowledge module system
Each every modular application version number associated
This provides developer flexibility module maintenance
If change applied module affected subroutine changed
This make program easier read understand
Modular programming main module many auxiliary module
The main module compiled executable EXE call auxiliary module function
Auxiliary module exist separate executable file load main EXE run
Each module unique name assigned PROGRAM statement
Function name across module unique easy access function used main module must exported
Languages support module concept IBM Assembler COBOL RPG FORTRAN Morpho Zonnon Erlang among others

design design approach subdivides system smaller part called module independently created used different system
A modular system characterized functional partitioning discrete scalable reusable module rigorous use modular interface making use industry standard interface
Besides reduction cost due le customization shorter learning time flexibility design modularity offer benefit augmentation adding new solution merely plugging new module exclusion
Examples modular system modular building
Earlier example include system system
Evolution also result modular design specie homologous module sharing approximately form function appear different organism
Computers use modularity overcome changing customer demand make manufacturing process adaptive change see
Modular design attempt combine advantage high volume normally equal low manufacturing cost
A downside modularity depends extent modularity low quality modular system optimized performance
This usually due cost putting interface module
There use modular design automobile although always case
All company comprise automobile manufacturing industry chosen manufacture using replaceable part instead even merely interchangeable part
Almost automobile part manufactured make model specific allows pricing limit innovation promotes premature scrappage due part unavailability
Not firm standard accepted industry standard also utilized
Finally standard even within model time
Modular design seen certain building
Modular building also modular home generally consist universal part module manufactured shipped build site assembled variety arrangement
Modular building added reduced size adding removing certain component
This done without altering larger portion building
Modular building also undergo change functionality using process adding removing component
For example building built using modular part wall frame door ceiling window
The interior partitioned divided wall furnished desk computer whatever else needed functioning workspace
If office need expanded redivided accommodate employee modular component wall panel added relocated make necessary change without altering whole building
Later office broken rearranged form space another type building using modular component originally formed office building
The new building refurnished whatever item needed carry desired function
Other type modular building offered company like Allied Modular include machine enclosure building many application
Many misconception held regarding modular building
In reality modular construction viable method construction quick turnaround fast growing company
Industries would benefit include healthcare commercial retail military housing
In introduced first rectangular color picture tube introduced modular brand
In opened first research development branch outside United States Israel management Moses Basin
In Motorola sold television business Matsushita parent company Panasonic
Modular design computer hardware thing
car refrigerator furniture
The idea build computer easily replaceable part use standardized interface
This technique allows user upgrade certain aspect computer easily without buy another computer altogether
This idea also implemented provides platform manufacture create module smartphone customised end user
A computer one best example modular design
Typical module include
All part easily interchangeable long user us part support standard interface
Similar computer modularity tool developed leverage modular design snap together interoperable module create circuit

My question around rolling hash function
It intuitive understand get xi without mod however mod sure still get right answer
Is mathematical theroem anyone could quote would help understand
So get whats guarantee correct even introducing mod Q Pretty sure basic mod arithmetic theorem missing
What missing identity b Q Q b Q Q
The video actually way around kicking term highest power multiplying It turn really make difference clearly always possible regardless whether modular arithmetic used
Going back wrote though
Without modular arithmetic division R possible dividend multiple R carefully constructed
With modular arithmetic division R possible R Q chosen R Q therefore R modular multiplicative inverse modulo Q divided
As bonus dividing R becomes multiplication easier integer division even constant

I read describes integer arithmetic circuit
The one thing describe operation modulus
How modular arithmetic done circuit
Can someone point resource describe modular step
In general everything describe pseudocode convert circuit
So modular arithmetic hand circuit
More point concrete idea modular arithmetic modulus Addition You already know add two number
Assuming number answer lie enough check whether result least subtract
Subtraction This similar addition
The idea
Multiplication Here basic idea compute result ab divide keep remainder
You possibly optimize modular reduction along way
Division This complicated probably better implemented microcode software
Suppose want compute
If prime assume b
We compute modular reciprocal b using multiply
If composite situation slightly complicated since b always inverse
In case first compute GCD g b b
There quotient b case proceed
Powering This quite complicated better implemented microcode software
Here idea use algorithm reducing modulo every step
Discrete logarithm Given g find
This complicated enough probably implemented hardware

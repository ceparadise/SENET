During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information

French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

The elective also include course outside CS department student whose interest cross departmental boundary would like interdisciplinary work
For detail specific class check course ranking site old class webpage official course evaluation
Course ranking site student comment official registrar data course difficulty instructor quality
Class webpage previous quarter often contain handout old assignment give good feel class material
Most CS class accessible via subdomain course number subdomain
For example page found
You find official course evaluation Axess Student Course Section Evaluations
When planning course load good idea take account difficulty class also type assignment
Taking class programming assignment large final project probably best idea
Typically balanced schedule includes mix programming class problem set class
More tip available
The information page kept much possible always good idea verify match specific since definitive source information matter
These requirement set approved School Engineering
Changes requirement must approved School Engineering Office Student Affairs Huang one quarter prior student last quarter
For student winter quarter senior year
More instruction form available
Using AP Credit satisfy math science requirement must also Office Student Affairs
To receive thisapproval take unofficial transcript Huang
The math science engineering fundamental requirement biocomputation track differ listed
Please see biocomputation specific
CS major may use Math AP credit satisfy calculus requirement
For information refer Calculus section
The undergradute curriculum requires two CS math class
These class give student necessary mathematical fundamental successful computer science Stanford beyond
Two additional math elective required CS major
The elective combination class approved set course listed first page
The current elective list includes class Math
together count one math elective
Because significant overlap material covered certain class combination counted towards math requirement
may used combination satisfy Math elective requirement
Students applying towards program sheet either math elective track requirement also apply program sheet
CS major must take class class
Mixing class different series acceptable
Physics lab required CS major
In general almost college level first year physic class cover mechanic E M awarded transfer credit count towards physic requirement
So want take physic Foothill College local community college home summer usually fine
The School Engineering approves requirement might wise check ahead time planning
AP credit also satisfy physic requirement
For information refer Physics section
The science elective one perhaps two class bring total science unit least
The list approved elective includes School Engineering plus
A AP Chemistry exam count unit science elective credit
This year also list class counted towards science elective
cover topic coverage faster pace
Note also possible take rather taking
It also strongly recommended take even considerable amount prior programming experience particularly know
This ensure necessary foundation advanced work expected later CS class

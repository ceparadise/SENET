As quality process model discussed paper need elaborate quality modeling technique important essence quality process model
In existing framework created understanding quality line quality modeling technique quality model result application technique clearly drawn
This report concentrate quality process modeling technique quality process model clearly differentiate two
Various framework developed help understanding quality process modeling technique one example Quality based modeling evaluation framework known framework argued provide set well defined quality property procedure make objective assessment property possible
This framework also advantage providing uniform formal description model element within one different model type using one modeling technique In short make assessment product quality process quality modeling technique regard set property defined
Quality property relate technique discussed To ass quality framework used illustrate quality dynamic essential modeling organisation DEMO business modeling technique
It stated evaluation framework DEMO modeling technique revealed shortcoming
One particular include quantifiable metric express quality business modeling technique make hard compare quality different technique overall rating
There also systematic approach quality measurement modeling technique known complexity metric suggested Rossi et al

Techniques Meta model used basis computation complexity metric
In comparison quality framework proposed quality measurement focus technical level instead individual model level
Authors Cardoso Mendling Neuman Reijers used complexity metric measure simplicity understandability design
This supported later research done Mendling argued without using quality metric help question quality property model simple process modeled complex unsuitable way
This turn lead lower understandability higher maintenance cost perhaps inefficient execution process question
The quality modeling technique important creating model quality contribute correctness usefulness model
Earliest process model reflected dynamic process practical process obtained instantiation term relevant concept available technology specific implementation environment process constraint
Enormous number research done quality model le focus shifted towards quality process model
Quality issue process model evaluated exhaustively however four main guideline framework practice
These quality framework metric related quality aspect empirical survey related modeling technique pragmatic guideline
Hommes quoted Wang main characteristic quality model grouped group namely correctness usefulness model correctness range model correspondence phenomenon modeled correspondence syntactical rule modeling also independent purpose model used
Whereas usefulness seen model helpful specific purpose hand model constructed first place
Hommes also make distinction internal correctness empirical syntactical semantic quality external correctness validity
A common starting point defining quality conceptual model look linguistic property modeling language syntax semantics often applied
Also broader approach based semiotics rather linguistic done Krogstie using quality framework known SEQUAL
It defines several quality aspect based relationship model knowledge Externalisation domain modeling language activity learning taking action modeling
The framework however provide way determine various degree quality used extensively business process modeling empirical test carried According previous research done Moody use conceptual model quality framework proposed Lindland evaluate quality process model three level quality identified From research noticed quality framework found easy use useful evaluating quality process model however limitation regard reliability difficult identify defect
These limitation led refinement framework subsequent research done
This framework called SEQUEL framework Krogstie Refined Krogstie Jørgensen included three quality aspect
Dimensions Conceptual Quality framework Modeling Domain set statement relevant correct describing problem domain Language Extension set statement possible given grammar vocabulary modeling language used
Model Externalization conceptual representation problem domain
It defined set statement problem domain actually made
Social Actor Interpretation Technical Actor Interpretation set statement actor human model user tool interact model respectively conceptual representation problem domain contains
Finally Participant Knowledge set statement human actor involved modeling process believe made represent problem domain
These quality dimension later divided two group deal physical social aspect model
In later work Krogstie et al
stated extension SEQUAL framework fixed limitation initial framework however limitation remain
In particular framework static view upon semantic quality mainly considering model modeling activity comparing model static domain rather seeing model facilitator changing domain
Also framework definition pragmatic quality quite narrow focusing understanding line semiotics Morris newer research linguistics semiotics focused beyond mere understanding model used affect interpreter
The need dynamic view semiotic quality framework particularly evident considering process model often prescribe even enact action problem domain hence change model may also change problem domain directly
This paper discus quality framework relation active process model suggests revised framework based
Further work Krogstie revise SEQUAL framework appropriate active process model redefining physical quality narrow interpretation previous research
The framework use Guidelines Modeling GoM based general accounting principle include six principle Correctness Clarity deal comprehensibility explicitness System description model system
Comprehensibility relates graphical arrangement information object therefore support understand ability model
Relevance relates model situation presented
Comparability involves ability compare model semantic comparison two model Economic efficiency produced cost design process need least covered proposed use cost cutting revenue increase
Since purpose organization case maximization profit principle defines borderline modeling process
The last principle Systematic design defines accepted differentiation diverse view within modeling
Correctness relevance economic efficiency prerequisite quality model must fulfilled remaining guideline optional necessary
The two framework SEQUAL GOM limitation use used people competent modeling
They provide major quality metric easily applicable
The use metric related quality aspect process model trying bridge gap use two framework modeling mostly theoretical empirical test carried support use
Most experiment carried relate relationship metric quality aspect work done individually different author Canfora et al
study connection mainly count metric example number task split maintainability software process model Cardoso validates correlation control flow complexity perceived complexity Mendling et al
use metric predict control flow error deadlock process model
The result reveal increase size model appears reduce quality comprehensibility
Further work Mendling et al
investigates connection metric understanding While metric confirmed regarding effect also personal factor modeler like competence revealed important understanding model
Several empirical survey carried still give clear guideline way evaluating quality process model necessary clear set guideline guide modeler task
Pragmatic guideline proposed different practitioner even though difficult provide exhaustive account guideline practice
In tip process modeling summarized many technical definition rule provided teach create process model effective primary mission maximizing shared understanding process
Most guideline easily put practice label activity rule suggested practitioner analyzed empirically
From research
value process model dependent choice graphical construct also annotation textual label need analyzed
It found result better model term understanding alternative labelling style
From earlier research way evaluate process model quality seen process model size structure expertise modeler modularity affect overall comprehensibility
Based set guideline presented Process Modeling Guidelines
This guideline us style well guideline number element model application structured modeling decomposition process model
The guideline follows still though limitation use Validity problem relate content process model way content organized represented
It suggest way organizing different structure process model content kept intact pragmatic issue must included model still left
The second limitation relates prioritizing guideline derived ranking small empirical basis relies involvement process modeler
This could seen one hand need wider involvement process modeler experience also rise question alternative approach may available arrive prioritizing guideline

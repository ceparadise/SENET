A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory

Learn without computer programming language

As begin writing real code one first thing must familiarize variable close cousin constant
A variable according name something allows value vary
In programming use variable store data run program
A variable contrasted constant whose value allowed change
In programming use constant store information know never going change
Even though variable constant may sound different semantically reality quite similar
We start studying constant look variable variable easier understand understood constant
My name Erik I think fair say constant never ever change
The absolute zero temperature also constant never change either
The number second one hour constant well never change always second hour
A constant purpose computer programming consists two thing name value
The name clearly illustrate constant le
The value actual value constant example absolute zero number second hour
In programming book name constant uppercase letter
This allows u clearly identify constant soon run code thus able distinguish variable written using lower case letter
A constant created using const reserved word followed constant data type followed constant name finally followed sign value
Let create constant see look like
What would appropriate name constant example
Names variable constant always programmer suggestion For worry meaning int uint
They data type explain later
When picking name constant variable want expressive order reduce risk ambiguity also absolutely fine use abbreviation long name take whole screen
For example NBR nbr common abbreviation number one see lot
There another rule pick name name must consist alphanumerical character
well underscore
You use underscore separate word become legible
In programming term initialize two constant
When initialize constant variable two thing Constants useful want set value repeat many location inside program
If use constant rather wrote several different location program wherever wanted refer absolute zero ever wanted change different number would change multiple location rather one
According Murphy law saying anything go wrong go wrong
This usually recipe disaster often even forgot change one value could lead strange error run program
By declaring constant allows u easily change value constant time run program change code one location opposed many reduces risk introducing error code
Variables similar constant main difference constant change assigned value variable oftentimes
We define variable similar fashion define constant instead using reserved word const use var
Let introduce concept called declaration
Declaration thought initialization without giving variable value
When declare variable simply inform computer intention use variable program computer allocate memory
Sometimes may prefer give variable value immediately language typically older language actually forced declare variable beginning code regardless code intend use
In modern language best practice indicate preferable declare initialize variable close possible first use concept declaration significant anymore used
Still educational purpose let declare variable designed store current temperature That variable available use code change value many time like
In fact variable value often changed many time program sometimes even million time
Let say programming teacher asked write program simulates rolling dice time end sum roll present number screen
Your teacher instructed keep track progress using variable
How many variable might need
In case would need one variable keep track sum one keep track many time rolled dice
We might therefore start initializing variable start program yet rolled dice hence sum Remember initialize variable declare give type name well give value
We would also initialize variable yet rolled dice
Each time program roll dice would add number displayed dice variable
After first dice roll might second might third might etc
The point always keep track total sum roll name indicates
Also time rolled dice would increment stop running program reached
It noted program stop running variable constant respective value lost
That typically program print information screen otherwise output save result run program preserve result
Just like may able describe word English certain type personal name number etc variable constant computer programming language
For example English might classified number whereas Steve Elon Larry Mark might classified name
Computers use similar type require bit granularity
We therefore familiarize two common data type programming integer string
Integers simply number without decimal
Integer variable take negative positive value referred signed integer
Signed refers fact minus sign front
Integer variable take positive value referred unsigned integer
When initialized wrote We picked unsigned integer type written uint know dice roll sum never negative
The reason picking unsigned integer choose roll dice many many time unsigned integer contain twice large number signed integer
The explanation simple signed integer unsigned integer allocated space memory signed integer however half capacity minus sign half unsigned integer capacity minus sign
Whether declare integer variable signed unsigned depend circumstance although time probably end using signed integer give flexibility
When learning programming theory however dealing large number worth noting difference signed unsigned integer
In example must use signed integer written int since must allow negative cash flow
We initialize signed integer variable following way The bit smallest unit information stored computer memory
A bit take one two value
An integer variable stored memory using one bit typically bit modern computer
The bit allocated integer higher largest value
The general formula many value integer take n equal number bit
This mean integer take two different value integer take four different value integer take value etc
The string second data type get know
Strings programming basically said equal text plain English
Here example string note use keyword string indicate declaring string All variable string variable set equal text surrounded quote
The quote fact one requirement string
Without quote would string
Whether use double quote single quote considered equivalent purpose book Pete equivalent Pete
We know properly refer left sign learned called either variable constant
This begs obvious question far right sign
The answer literal
In example say Pete string literal integer literal
A literal anything written directly code example text number
Literals show many location code right sign
Both integer string would somewhat uninteresting perform operation
By operation point referring arithmetic integer
adding subtracting dividing multiplying string concatenation string
joining two string together
A example operation performed integer follow We start initializing two unsigned integer data type uint number minus sign front
We purchase ice cream reduce accordingly
Note simply applying basic algebra
Our variable value
Let say get lucky find street proceed donate half wallet charity Our variable value
Let turn attention string operation
In section discus concatenation
Concatenation act combining two string
For example concatenated two string Programming class would end Programming class
Here concatenate two string value Erik Linde
As see simply use sign want concatenate string
Observe empty space inserted two string

OK let talk constant Variables
What constant
Well something fixed like school starting A variable something varies
It change according situation
For example Monday running late class leap bicycle get Wednesday get lift friend
Computer language built constant Variables made three group Data information knowledge
Data number picture symbol anything else context
If I say number mean thing
It number
If I say information refers hour day morning
If still snoring bed I tell late class start still duvet
That knowledge
Moving Data Types broken number logic character
OK first number Data Types
There two category first integer Data Types
These whole number either positive negative zero
Real Data Types number decimal form use currency measurement like g packet crisp ticket see band
Next Boolean logical Data Types based choice way make logical decision based set choice
Here example Boolean Data type command If AND class start
AND I bed print Uh oh
Bad news
However one choice return negative answer outcome different based logic question answer
For instance If OR Monday AND I done homework print Uh oh
Detention wait
If Monday done homework nothing printed
Hooray
Lastly character Data Types
These come string sequence like song lyric made letter space punctuation hold combination letter number symbol
All Data Types combined become Data entity structured set rule command either Variables range value constant value fixed

I taking CS course frankly I idea lecturer talking regard abstract data type algebra
It something I readily able find solution web I thought maybe someone community would greater insight undestanding problem
Stack Queue notation certainly bit odd mean real term understand general behaviour queue stack first first v first last
Abstract Data Types used behavior type must without specifying implementation
You define type set axiom rule describe condition must hold every moment
said ADTs useful tool describe behavior queue
But well leaving Djikstra known humor aside I think least one real application ADT
Assertions allow specify type work formal compilable runnable language opposed natural language documentation
In methodoloy often written predicate must hold execution method general operation type source language form
Frameworks support assertion automatic check every predicate hold
This way code violates one assertion know bug
So sense seen form unit testing specifying test case would empirical testing methodology specifying precondition invariant type must fit would theoretical testing methodology
Although used mainstream software development far I know checking assertion performance hit used testing
From purely theoretical point view ADTs abstraction allows u reason behavior type regardless specific implementation
If like formalism like I nothing better developer give list theorem rather ambiguous babble describing code supposed

The data type value variable context attribute tell kind data value
Most often term used connection static typing variable programming language like Java C etc type variable known compile time
Data type include storage classification like integer floating point value string character etc
Data type define particular characteristic data used software program inform compiler predefined attribute required specific variable associated data object
A software program may create many variable object correspond different program completion aspect
For example payroll program may include employee variable name Security number contact information wherein variable contain different data type
A Social Security number variable consists character creating integer data type variable whereas employee name variable solely comprised alpha character creating character data type variable
Each variable initialized data type coding inform compiler expected variable data
Initialization also necessary data type different characteristic require preallocated space memory

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

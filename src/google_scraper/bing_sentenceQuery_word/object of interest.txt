In instance
Objects abstraction
They hold data way manipulate data
The data usually visible outside object
It changed using mechanism usually called
Suppose bank account bank account current balance also thing done
These field however directly accessible
There method like
Most application object change object interface
Banks usually impose
Suppose dollar account
If client special agreement bank take money account withdraw maximum dollar
He might agreement bank borrow money bank pay fee
In case might able withdraw dollar dollar
So withdraw method lot check described
The account manager might see account differently might method set maximum amount taken account set fee interest rate customer pay money borrowed
As object instance class certain thing class
It perhaps compared object class
Two apple one red bigger green smaller
On hand It easy compare different object
A green apple much common steel wrench

For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I mind particular object
Given image taken camera I want check whether image contains instance object
For instance let say object bathroom sink
There many kind bathroom sink tend share common element shape size color function
There also significant variation lighting pose
Given image I want know whether image contains bathroom sink
How I
What would appropriate
Is research topic
Of course easy use Google Images obtain many example image known contain bathroom sink whatever object I looking might could used training sort machine learning algorithm
This suggests maybe combination computer vision plus machine learning might promising approach I sure exactly specific might look like
If one several image particular sink object possibly use feature algorithm match object
You investigate OpenCV project includes many possibly patented algorithm
You get idea work
If specialize matching previously known instance particular object might appropriate
Additionally much research specializing facial recognition possibly find work
Another project interest
I know though reliably identify anything seems rely sort recognition semantics search well must name object sketch
You read If want recognize generic sink concept many multiple generic concept bordering strong er AI
There lot machine learning project I sure useful practical demonstrate cutting edge possibly practical unless spend lot time research made giant GPU neural network successfully trained recognize cat presumably learning sort ability conceptualize abstract idea cat look like
Related work
This cutting edge practical pointing trying recognize generic thing Google working hard recognize generic cat lot work
There multiple approach taken account
Some mentioned
From want I think apply combination technique get good result
In opinion start blob matching affine invariant followed keypoint feature matching inside blob verify result
I think approach give reasonable result
Once preliminary result definitely move onto complicated algorithm using machine learning etc

An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

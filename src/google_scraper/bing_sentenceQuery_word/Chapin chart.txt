Become computer programmer lesson My passion academic life computer programming
Ever since I took AP computer science junior year college I knew going career
I enjoyed much I became teacher assistant class next year
I went tutor many student took skill way college
I understand different people learn I worked many people many different learning pattern
I enjoy knowing teach something I passion
software engineer experience autonomous vehicle trading cybersecurity
I also currently attending top computer science Masters program Georgia Tech specializing machine intelligence fill gap knowledge
I know firsthand difficult learn programming whether total newbie budding intermediate I overcame challenge guide overcome
I also year tutoring experience surely come handy
I teach C I took lesson pas
I currently enrolled bachelor science computer science focus
This second year college
College first experience programming though
I began learning skill I grade
This began learning html moving cs
After I decided I would gain knowledge field python
In total I programming around year
In two year I computer science degree Michigan State
I finishing bachelor degree Computer Science New York University
Hello perspective student
I software developer Columbia SC area
I professional developer since passion coding
What make learning software development Not I work industry everyday I know simply technical jargon easy understand
Below list skill I teach
You also learn
Take Care I look forward working
Skills SQL basic HTML Basics Wordpress AngularJS Basics Linux Basics Entity Framework WEB API C Basics Although I statistic major programming big part curriculum concentration within statistic computer learning
I taken fair share Computer science course Carnegie Mellon University even statistic assignment often require heavy programming
My current job sole web developer growing company includes front back end development well database management
Zero travel time great busy schedule
Typically priced lower local lesson
Online student stick lesson long local student

Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph
In note look
They include

Leesville SC I Christian woman successfully three daughter year subject high school also two girl grade year
I experience tutoring elementary Lexington SC My computer experience go back early
I learned type year old programming code year old
I began Apple II computer migrated toward PC platform completing high school
In Lexington SC I started college Commercial Art class short completion I discovered I could get BFA Computer Art Design
Computer art become passion mine I wanted know
So I changed Degrees
I created graphic design Lexington SC I German native lived England almost five year I teacher different Secondary Schools moving US
I wide range experience teaching language including German French English well Batesburg SC The secret knowledge reading becoming proficient reader
I tell new student read begin understand subject
I tutoring year
The last year I tutored supplemental education Meet locally

Draft May The fascinating history evolution structured flowchart usually called Diagrams structograms go back
As graduate student I got idea attending ACM organized talk New York Michael Jackson structured programming
If GOTOs avoided line old flowchart avoided well
Fifteen minute sketching led first idea sequence conditionals iteration
Returning Stony Brook fellow graduate student Isaac Nassi shaped idea based knowledge structured programming principle
Together wrote original paper quickly
So sent unrefereed ACM SIGPLAN Special Interest Group Programming Languages Notices appeared August
Nassi Shneiderman SIGPLAN Notices August
Since referenced thousand time spawned dozen software implementation taught dozen textbook required national standard country
In Germany widely used known Struktogramme standardized DIN November INFORMATION PROCESSING FLOWCHART SYMBOLS
It exciting see idea spread others extended sometimes abused influence
I think appeal simplicity originality ease extending embedding
For visually oriented user provides compact overview program show relationship nicely
On hand may consume paper code harder scan detail
I believe helpful early stage program design sketching modular design
For people aid guiding thinking nested conditional structure visual way decision table
Note unfortunately many citation
Some recent web reference include The EASYCODE family evolved many year several company
Early version include EasyCODE CASE Tool Editor Advanced Nassi Shneiderman Charts ANSC EasyCODE BKR Programming Maintenance Development Documentation Using method structure diagram document logic flow program EasyCODE keep every source code fit
EasyCODE ideal engineering existing source code documentation
It handle incredible variety different programming language COBOL FORTRAN Basic Pascal Oracle SQL
In heart EasyCODE still powerfull graphical editor using structure diagram method create display software
Today EasyCODE support programming language according developer one common tool documentation maintenance purpose
For developer especially Embedded Field EasyCODE offer various extension quality insurance
With around sold license EasyCODE become important development tool
Please visit information free trial version Easy designed modular manner used graphic software development form structured chart
Easy always show strength requirement become complex maintenance development project performed post documentation needed rapidly
Microsoft Visio includes template SourceCoder analyzes profile Delphi source code giving developer quantitative code measurement enabling quickly pinpoint problematic area
SourceCoder automatically creates structograms

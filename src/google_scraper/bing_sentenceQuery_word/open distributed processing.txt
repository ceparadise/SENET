A goal challenge pursued computer scientist practitioner distributed system however goal fallen favour industry distributed system different conventional system difference partial system failure partial upgrade simply papered attempt transparency see
also refers use distributed system solve computational problem
In problem divided many task solved one computer communicate message passing
The word term distributed system distributed programming originally referred computer network individual computer physically distributed within geographical area
The term nowadays used much wider sense even referring autonomous run physical computer interact message passing
While single definition distributed system following defining property commonly used A distributed system may common goal solving large computational problem user perceives collection autonomous processor unit
Alternatively computer may user individual need purpose distributed system coordinate use shared resource provide communication service user

Reasons using distributed system distributed computing may include Examples distributed system application distributed computing include following Many task would like automate using computer type would like ask question computer produce answer
In task called
Formally computational problem consists together instance
Instances question ask solution desired answer question
Theoretical computer science seek understand computational problem solved using computer efficiently
Traditionally said problem solved using computer design produce correct solution given instance
Such algorithm implemented run computer program read problem instance performs computation produce solution
Formalisms used abstract model sequential computer executing algorithm

The discussion focus case multiple computer although many issue concurrent process running single computer
Three viewpoint commonly used In case distributed algorithm computational problem typically related graph
Often graph describes structure computer network problem instance
This illustrated following example
Consider computational problem finding coloring given graph
Different field might take following approach While field parallel algorithm different focus field distributed algorithm lot interaction two field
For example graph coloring originally presented parallel algorithm technique also used directly distributed algorithm
Moreover parallel algorithm implemented either parallel system using shared memory distributed system using message passing
The traditional boundary parallel distributed algorithm choose suitable network run given network lie place boundary parallel distributed system shared memory message passing
In parallel algorithm yet another resource addition time space number computer

If decision problem solved using polynomial number processor problem said class
The class NC defined equally well using PRAM formalism Boolean machine simulate Boolean circuit efficiently vice versa
In analysis distributed algorithm attention usually paid communication operation computational step
Perhaps simplest model distributed computing synchronous system node operate lockstep fashion
During node parallel receive latest message neighbour perform arbitrary local computation send new message neighbor
In system central complexity measure number synchronous communication round required complete task
This complexity measure closely related network

Before task begun network node either unaware node serve coordinator leader task unable communicate current coordinator
After coordinator election algorithm run however node throughout network recognizes particular unique node task coordinator
The network node communicate among order decide get coordinator state
For need method order break symmetry among
For example node unique comparable identity node compare identity decide node highest identity coordinator
The definition problem often attributed LeLann formalized method create new token token token lost
Coordinator election algorithm designed economical term total transmitted time
The algorithm suggested Gallager Humblet Spira general undirected graph strong impact design distributed algorithm general influential paper distributed computing
Many algorithm suggested different kind network undirected ring unidirectional ring complete graph grid directed Euler graph others
A general method decouples issue graph family design coordinator election algorithm suggested Korach Kutten Moran
In order perform coordination distributed system employ concept coordinator
The coordinator election problem choose process among group process different processor distributed system act central coordinator
Several central coordinator election algorithm exist
So far focus distributed system solves given problem
A complementary research problem property given distributed system

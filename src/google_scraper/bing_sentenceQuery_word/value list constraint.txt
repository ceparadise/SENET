In wherein stated form
Constraints differ common language specify step sequence step execute rather property solution found
This make constraint programming form
The constraint used constraint programming various kind used
A B true
others
Constraints usually embedded within programming language provided via separate
Constraint programming expressed form embeds constraint
This variant logic programming due Jaffar Lassez extended specific class constraint introduced
The first implementation constraint logic programming
Instead logic programming constraint mixed
Programming language support constraint include functional programming imperative programming
Mostly constraint implemented imperative language via separate library existing imperative language
Constraint programming embedding constraint host language
The first host language used language field initially called
The two paradigm share many important feature like logical variable
Today implementation include one library constraint logic programming
The difference two largely style approach modeling world
Some problem natural thus simpler write logic program natural write constraint program
The constraint programming approach search state world large number constraint satisfied time
A problem typically stated state world containing number unknown variable
The constraint program search value variable
Temporal concurrent constraint programming TCC temporal concurrent constraint programming MJV variant constraint programming deal time
Languages programming follow one two approach typical example refinement model typical example perturbation model
The refinement model general restrict variable single value lead several solution problem
However perturbation model intuitive programmer using mixed imperative constraint language
The constraint used constraint programming typically specific domain
Some popular domain constraint programming Finite domain one successful domain constraint programming
In area like constraint programming often identified constraint programming finite domain
All example commonly solved SMT solver
Finite domain solver useful solving often based one approximation
The syntax expressing constraint finite domain depends host language
The following program solves classical puzzle constraint logic programming The interpreter creates variable letter puzzle
The operator used specify domain variable range set value
The constraint mean two variable take value zero
When interpreter evaluates constraint reduces domain two variable removing value
Then constraint considered reduce domain simply stored
The last constraint specifies digit assigned letter must hold letter replaced corresponding digit
From constraint solver infers
All stored constraint involving variable M awakened case constraint remove value domain remaining variable
Constraint propagation may solve problem reducing domain single value may prove problem solution reducing domain empty set may also terminate without proving satisfiability unsatisfiability
The literal used actually perform search solution
Constraint programming often realized imperative programming via separate library
Some popular library constraint programming

A sequence several variable grouped together single name
Instead writing program many variable define single variable access member etc
More importantly put expression variable inside square bracket like
This allows u deal arbitrarily large data set using single small piece code
One way create list enclosing several value separated comma square bracket So example variable whose value string
You also change value item list print entire list As see treated variable value changed
Next try predict final state visualized example compare actually running code
If try ask Python index exist give error In example length first index maximum possible index
Asking index anything larger give kind error
To determine number item list call function list
Look used following example
It common use write code work list length like example next exercise
At point might noticed operation list lot like string passed function get length use extract individual item
Lists string indeed related Python
The one major difference individual character string changed
For reason list called type string see little information lesson
From type may remember possible use merge two string together
You thing list Similarly use multiplication symbol extend list repetition
This useful creating new list desired length
To solve next exercise use one operator introduced loop
To get last item list use More generally return th item end list Python handle internally translating
This shortcut notation work string
palindrome first last letter r second letter etc
Write function take string input return string palindrome otherwise
The function saw also applied list number return largest number list
Likewise function return sum element list
It common like previous exercise loop every value list
Python allows shortcut perform type operation usually called
Specifically L list code Here visualized example printing element list For loop work string try

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

I trying solve following problem related I list L item sorted order importance important
Each item multiple tag assigned combination tag different item may tag tag tag
Now I make batch list L distribution item according tag subject following Each batch fixed size B Each tag range item batch distribution ranging minimum maximum
So B contain minimum item tag item tag maximum item item
We start picking item top L keep filling batch reach final distribution satisfies constraint
If say L item make batch size go number item list pick item make desired distribution
Remember item picked list count tag assigned go
I thinking solution first I make list item corresponding specific tag
I pick minimum desired item particular tag list
So I pick item tag list item tag irrespective whether item contain tag
This way I ensure criterion tag satisfied
But max part tag definitely go overboard
How I recursively keep replacing item batch remaining item L make final desired distribution
Any solution would great
Or existing algorithm get right direction approach problem
I know question bit wordy probably bit confusing tried explain well I course problem might lot interesting I suppose
Let repeat understanding problem I understand sketch candidate solution approach
If I misunderstood problem might need revise question clarify
The problem You n item want divide batch B item
Presumably n multiple B
Each item set tag subset T T denotes set possible tag
For batch given function f T N want ensure candidate tag T least f item batch tag
The question identify valid division batch one exists
One candidate solution formulate integer linear programming problem
Let j denote variable item placed batch j otherwise
Now write constraint x correspond problem description
We get j j j B j f j
Here denotes set item tag
You use integer linear programming solver search solution problem
If I understand problem quite right I hope see basic idea solution hopefully able come appropriate tweak address misunderstanding I might problem looking solve

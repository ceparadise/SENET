discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

often shortened process lead original formulation problem
Programming involves activity analysis developing understanding generating verification requirement algorithm including correctness resource consumption implementation commonly referred algorithm target
written one programming language
The purpose programming find sequence instruction automate performing specific task solving given problem
The process programming thus often requires expertise many different subject including knowledge specialized algorithm formal
Related task include maintaining implementation build system management derived artifact computer program
These might considered part programming process often term used larger process term reserved actual writing source code
combine technique software development practice
Programmable device existed least far back AD programmable via peg play various rhythm drum pattern could produce entirely different weave changing program series card hole punched
However first computer program generally dated mathematician published calculate sequence intended carried
In invented concept storing form
Later plugboard added Type I Tabulator allowed programmed different job late programmed control panel similar way first
However concept introduced program data stored manipulated way
crucial role computer programming beginning first computer programmer woman quotation needed
Computer programming considered many assumed coding process trivial mechanical work could given woman
Soon female became involved intellectual process originally done male planner
In computer company like began make computer
While could could
Companies became need solve varied complex problem
This began new appreciation programmer increased demand service went hand hand rise salary This boost status pay computer programmer attracted lot men computer programming
language early program written particular machine often notation
soon developed let programmer specify instruction text format ADD X TOTAL abbreviation operation code meaningful name specifying address
However assembly language little different notation machine language two machine also different assembly language
allow programmer write program term le bound underlying hardware
They harness power computer make programming easier allowing programmer specify calculation entering formula directly
first widely used language functional implementation came many language soon developed particular aimed commercial data processing computer research
Programs mostly still entered using punched card
See
By late became inexpensive enough program could created typing directly computer
developed allowed change correction made much easily punched card
Whatever approach development may final program must satisfy fundamental property
The following property among important In computer programming refers ease human reader comprehend purpose operation source code
It affect aspect quality including portability usability importantly maintainability
Readability important programmer spend majority time reading trying understand modifying existing source code rather writing new source code
Unreadable code often lead bug inefficiency
A study found simple readability transformation made code shorter drastically reduced time understand
Following consistent often help readability
However readability programming style
Many factor little nothing ability computer efficiently compile execute code contribute readability
Some factor include The aspect indent line break color highlighting often handled content aspect reflect programmer talent skill
Various also developed intent resolve readability concern adopting approach code structure display
IDEs aim integrate help
Techniques like enhance readability
The academic field engineering practice computer programming largely concerned discovering implementing efficient algorithm given class problem
For purpose algorithm classified using express resource use execution time memory consumption term size input
Expert programmer familiar variety algorithm respective complexity use knowledge choose algorithm best suited circumstance
The first step formal software development process requirement analysis followed testing determine value modeling implementation failure elimination debugging
There exist lot differing approach task
One approach popular analysis
Many programmer use form various stage formal software development integrated together short cycle take week rather year
There many approach Software development process
Popular modeling technique include Analysis Design Architecture
The Unified Modeling Language notation used OOAD MDA
A similar technique used database design Modeling
Implementation technique include imperative language
It difficult determine popular modern programming language
Methods measuring programming language popularity include counting number job advertisement mention language number book sold course teaching language overestimate importance newer language estimate number existing line code written language underestimate number user business language COBOL
Some language popular particular kind application language regularly used write many different kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large engineering application development
Many application use mix several language construction use
New language generally designed around syntax prior language new functionality added example add C Java add memory management result loses efficiency ability manipulation
Debugging important task software development process since defect program significant consequence user
Some language prone kind fault specification require compiler perform much checking language
Use tool help detect possible problem
Normally first step debugging attempt reproduce problem
This task example parallel process unusual software bug
Also specific user environment usage history make difficult reproduce problem
After bug reproduced input program may need simplified make easier debug
For example bug compiler make crash parsing large source file
However simplification test case line original source file sufficient reproduce crash
Such simplification done manually using approach
The programmer try remove part original test case check problem still exists
When debugging problem GUI programmer try skip user interaction original problem description check remaining action sufficient bug appear
Debugging often done like
Standalone debugger like also used often provide le visual environment usually using
Some text editor allow GDB invoked provide visual environment
Different programming language support different style programming called
The choice language used subject many consideration company policy suitability task availability package individual preference
Ideally programming language best suited task hand selected
ideal involve finding enough programmer know language build team availability compiler language efficiency program written given language execute
Languages form approximate spectrum language typically faster execute whereas language abstract easier use execute le quickly
It usually easier code language one
book writes Many computer language provide mechanism call function provided
Provided function library follow appropriate convention method passing function may written language
Computer programmer write computer software
Their job usually involve

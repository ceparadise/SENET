This noob question I wan na know different encoding type difference ie
ASCII etc
Reasons many I believe main point How many character need display encode
If live US example could go pretty far ASCII
But many county need character like etc
If SO ASCII try read text ASCII encoded text see weird character place
Think also China Japan Thailand exotic countires
Those weird figure photo may seen around world might letter pretty picture
As difference different encoding type need see specification
Here something
I familiar
Here information difference
used need encode binary data need stored transferred medium designed deal textual data
If ever made somesort email system PHP probably encountered
Is short To support computer program user interface localization many different language
Programming language still mainly consist character found ASCII encoding althought possible example Java use encoding variable name source code file usually stored something else ASCII encoded text example encoding
In short Always different people trying solve problem specific point view even without point view even possible result may quite different
Quote Joel unicode article link Because byte room eight bit lot people got thinking gosh use code purpose
The trouble lot people idea time idea go space
Thanks Joachim tchrist info discussion
Here two article I read
Both link page I linked earlier
I forgotten stuff Joel article since I last read year back
Good introduction subject I hope
Mark Davis go little deeper
The real reason many variant came along late
In The Beginning memory storage expensive using sometimes bit memory store single character considered excessive
Thus pretty much text stored using bit per character
Clearly bit enough memory represent character human language
It barely enough represent character used language even possible
Therefore many different character encoding designed allow different language English German Greek Russian encode text bit per character
After single text file usually even single computer system ever used single language right
This led situation single mapping character number kind
Many different incompatible solution produced real central control existed
Some computer system used others used precisely one many variation EBCDIC one many derivative big list encoding hardly heard
Finally Unicode Consortium stepped task produce single mapping together auxiliary data useful outside bound answer
When Unicode consortium finally produced comprehensive list character computer might represent together number encoding scheme encode binary data depending concrete need character encoding scheme already widely used
This slowed adoption Unicode encoding considerably
These day want represent text best bet use one encoding represent Unicode character
together suffice use case cover almost others
And clear encoding encode valid Unicode character
But due fact encoding might ideal use case
Unless need able interact legacy system handle encoding rarely reason choose anything else day
The main reason able show character
When internet infancy noone really planned ahead thinking one day would people using country language around world
So small character set good enough
Gradually revealed limited thus demand bigger character set

Cleartext transmitted stored subjected meant encrypted
As cleartext require order displayed
In simplest form cleartext rendered read word processor text editor
However cleartext subjected special format Word WordPerfect
Any text read computer appropriate program without need decryption considered cleartext
The term cleartext sometimes confused
Plaintext special instance cleartext meant encrypted prior transmission storage result decryption received retrieved data
In information technology text sequence character word form encoded format
Text differs encoded data graphic image program sometimes said binary code actually format

In computing used represent repertoire kind system
Depending context corresponding resulting code space may regarded natural electrical etc
A character encoding used transmission textual
Character set character map codeset related identical term
Early character code associated optical electrical could represent subset character used written language sometimes restricted upper case letter numeral punctuation
The low cost digital representation data modern computer system allows elaborate character code represent character used many written language
Character encoding using internationally accepted standard permit worldwide interchange text electronic form
Early binary repertoire include encoding Chinese character
Common example character encoding system include American Standard Code Information Interchange
introduced used encode letter character via series long short press
Representations character encoded using Morse code varied length
The encoding created patented modified Donald Murray standardized CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet No
code introduced Army Signal Corps late
encoding scheme used IBM early computer example computer well associated peripheral
BCD extended existing simple numeric encoding include alphabetic special character mapping easily encoding already widespread use
It precursor EBCDIC
introduced encoding scheme used encode letter numeral symbol device code using
usually abbreviated EBCDIC encoding scheme developed
The limitation set soon became apparent number method developed extend
The need support different language including family East Asian script required support far larger number character demanded systematic approach character encoding rather previous ad hoc approach
In trying develop universally interchangeable character encoding researcher faced dilemma one hand seemed necessary add bit accommodate additional character hand user relatively small character set Latin alphabet still constituted majority computer user additional bit colossal waste expensive computing resource would always zeroed user
The compromise solution eventually found developed Unicode break assumption dating back telegraph code character always directly correspond particular sequence bit
Instead character would first mapped universal intermediate representation form abstract number called
Code point would represented variety way various default number bit per character code unit depending context
To encode code point higher length code unit unit solution implement escape sequence would signal subsequent bit parsed higher code point
Terminology related code unit The Latin character set used English European language though Greek character set used Greek language
The character repertoire abstract set one million character found wide variety script including
Other symbol musical notation also included character repertoire
Both Unicode standard character repertoire
As new character added one standard standard also add character maintain parity
The code unit size equivalent bit measurement particular encoding Consider letter abc followed represented
That string contains To express character Unicode hexadecimal value prefixed string
The range valid code point Unicode standard inclusive divided identified number
Characters range plane called BMP
This plane contains character
Characters range plane called
The following table show example code point value A code point represented sequence code unit
The mapping defined encoding
Thus number code unit required represent code point depends encoding parallel standard together constitute modern unified character encoding
Rather mapping character directly octet separately define character available corresponding natural number number encoded series natural number code unit finally unit encoded stream octet
The purpose decomposition establish universal set character encoded variety way
To describe model correctly requires precise term character set character encoding
The term used modern model follow A full set abstract character system support
The repertoire may closed
addition allowed without creating new standard case ASCII series may open allowing addition case Unicode limited extent
The character given repertoire reflect decision made divide writing system basic information unit
The basic variant alphabet broken letter digit punctuation space arranged simple linear sequence displayed order read
But even alphabet pose complication regarded either part single character containing letter diacritic known precomposed character separate character
The former allows far simpler text handling system latter allows combination used text
pose similar problem
Other writing system Arabic Hebrew represented complex character repertoire due need accommodate thing like bidirectional text joined together different way different situation
A CCS map character code point represents one character
For example given repertoire capital letter A Latin alphabet might represented code point character B
Multiple coded character set may share repertoire example IBM code page cover repertoire map different code point
A CEF mapping code point facilitate storage system represents number bit sequence fixed length
practically computer system
For example system store numeric information unit directly represent code point unit larger code point say million could represented using multiple unit
This correspondence defined CEF
Next CES mapping code unit sequence octet facilitate storage file system transmission network
Simple character encoding scheme include compound character encoding scheme switch several simple scheme using compressing scheme try minimise number byte used per code unit
Although simpler CES system working Unicode use either ASCII map Unicode code point sequence octet map Unicode code point sequence word
See detailed discussion
Finally may supply additional information select particular variant character particularly regional variant Unicode character
An example attribute xml lang
The Unicode model us term historical system directly assign sequence character sequence byte covering CCS CEF CES layer
Historically term character encoding character map character set synonymous standard would specify repertoire character encoded stream code unit usually single character per code unit
But term related distinct meaning due effort standard body use precise terminology writing unifying many different encoding system
Regardless term still used interchangeably nearly ubiquitous
A usually mean encoding regard suite encoding covering different script many character share code page
code page suite Windows based IBM DOS based see detail
Most encoding referred code page encoding see byte size
IBM Character Data Representation Architecture CDRA designates coded character set identifier variously called charset character set code page CHARMAP
The term code page occur Unix Linux charmap preferred usually larger context locale
Contrasted character encoding map abstract character
A character set parlance character encoding CCS
encoding term sometimes used characterize old character encoding ambiguity sense
Most use context refers encoding fail cover Unicode code point generally using somewhat different character repertoire several code point representing one Unicode character versa see

Some source refer encoding preceded Unicode
All Windows code page usually referred legacy antedate Unicode unable represent possible Unicode code point
As result many character encoding method use need backward compatibility archived data many computer program developed translate data encoding scheme form data

What difference LZW Huffman coding text compression
I read I able distinguish
encoding rather encoding since many different variant Huffman coding different algorithm
Choose block length usually one byte
For possible value block choose bit string bit string prefix another one known code
This choice either fixed like JPEG Huffman code principle adaptive often fixed standard code adaptive chosen according actual text compressed
Each block encoded bit string result concatenated
The name proper refers optimal choice code given distribution value block
Huffman code satisfy following optimality property source compressed consists
copy distribution block length tends infinity average number bit used encode one copy entropy source
Here idea separate input bit instead bit choose longer block piece piece consists earlier piece plus additional bit end
For example input partitioned
The idea encode piece referring earlier piece including additional bit
For example number piece empty piece previous example could encoded
There many different variant encoding
In particular practice keep earlier piece memory specific encoding pair p b encoding earlier piece new bit
encoding optimal ergodic source expected length compressed stream tends entropy
Both lossless data compression algorithm
I would say main difference Huffman coding static technique based given estimated probability know priori produce code

Typically share text file without worrying underlying detail text stored
However share text file people work language download text file across Internet share text file computer system may need choose encoding standard open save file
When someone else open text file Microsoft Word another program perhaps computer system software language different language used create file encoding standard help program determine represent text readable
What appears text screen actually stored numeric value text file
Your computer translates numeric value visible character
It using encoding standard
An encoding standard numbering scheme assigns text character character set numeric value
A character set include alphabetical character number symbol
Different language commonly consist different set character many different encoding standard exist represent character set used different language
The encoding standard saved text file provides information computer need display text screen
For example Cyrillic Windows encoding character Й numeric value
When open file contains character computer us Cyrillic Windows encoding computer read numeric value display Й screen
However open file computer us different encoding computer display whatever character corresponds numeric value encoding standard computer us default
For example computer us Western European Windows encoding standard character original file displayed É rather Й Western European Windows encoding value map É
To avoid problem encoding decoding text file save file Unicode encoding
Unicode accommodates character set across language commonly used among computer user today
Because Word based Unicode Word automatically save file encoded Unicode
You open read file computer system regardless language text
Likewise use system save file encoded Unicode file include character found Western European alphabet Greek Cyrillic Arabic Japanese character
If open file text appears garbled question mark box Word may accurately detected encoding standard text file
You specify encoding standard use display decode text
For Microsoft Office Word first two step click click

If choose encoding standard save file Word encodes file Unicode
Usually use default Unicode encoding support character language
If document opened program support Unicode choose encoding standard match target program
For example Unicode enables create Traditional Chinese language document system
However document opened Traditional Chinese language program support Unicode save document Chinese Traditional encoding
When document opened Traditional Chinese language program text displayed properly
Because Unicode comprehensive standard saving text encoding may result character longer displayed
For example document encoded Unicode contain Hebrew Cyrillic text
If document saved Cyrillic Windows encoding Hebrew text longer displayed document saved Hebrew Windows encoding Cyrillic text longer displayed
If choose encoding standard support character used file Word mark red character save
You preview text encoding standard choose save file

If receive message state Text marked red save correctly chosen encoding try choose different encoding select check box
When allow character substitution Word replaces character displayed closest equivalent character encoding chose
For example three dot replace ellipsis straight quotation mark replace curly quotation mark
If encoding chose equivalent character character marked red character marked red saved character question mark
If document opened program wrap text one line next include hard line break document selecting check box specifying whether want line break delineated carriage return CR line feed LF box

Can I know exact difference Unicode ASCII
ASCII total character extended set
Is size specification Unicode character
ASCII defines character map number
Unicode defines le character similarly map number though number currently assigned reserved
Unicode superset ASCII number meaning ASCII Unicode
For example number mean Latin capital
Because Unicode character generally fit one byte numerous way storing Unicode character byte sequence
Understanding ASCII Unicode created first place helped understand actually work
As stated answer ASCII us bit represent character
By using bit maximum distinct combination
Which mean represent character maximum
The last bit used avoiding error
This relevant year ago
Most ASCII character printable character alphabet abc ABC etc
The others tab etc
See binary representation character ASCII See full ASCII table
ASCII meant English
Because center computer industry USA time
As consequence need support accent mark etc
aka
Some clever people started using bit bit used parity encode character support language support French example
Just using one extra bit doubled size original ASCII table map character character
And
The name ASCII extended bit bit could referred extended ASCII ASCII
As pointed comment thing yet easy way refer trick
There many variation ASCII table example
ASCII Extended solves problem language based Latin alphabet others needing completely different alphabet
Greek
Russian
Chinese like
We would needed entirely new character set rational behind Unicode
Unicode contain every character every language sure contains gigantic amount character
You save text hard drive Unicode
Unicode abstract representation text
You need encode abstract representation
That come play
pretty good job explaining basic us ASCII set first character
That handy mean ASCII text also valid
Mnemonics Note This obvious case
We seven slot available filled either
Each two combination
If seven spot combination
Think combination lock seven wheel wheel two number
Source
ASCII code point
It fit single byte value tended used character
With incompatible choice causing disaster
Text encoded one code page read correctly program assumes guessed another code page
Unicode came solve disaster
Version started code point commonly encoded bit
Later extended version million code point
The current version using available million code point
That fit bit anymore
Encoding common came around used Microsoft Apple operating system example
And language runtimes like Java
The spec came way map million code point
An encoding called variable length encoding one code point take either byte
The original code point take byte added one take
Another variable length encoding common used operating system tool code point take byte original ASCII code take byte rest take
The length encoding take byte code point
Not often used since pretty wasteful
There one like widely ignored
An issue encoding order byte depend machine created text stream
So add mix
Having different encoding choice brings back code page disaster degree along heated debate among programmer UTF choice best
Their association operating system default pretty much draw line
One definition BOM Byte Order Mark special codepoint zero width space beginning text stream indicates rest stream encoded
It indicates UTF encoding endianess neutral text rendering engine
Unfortunately optional many programmer claim right omit accident still pretty common
ASCII code position allocated graphic character control character control code
Unicode code position
About currently allocated character many code point made permanently noncharacters
used encode character ever code point yet assigned
The thing ASCII Unicode They character code
The first code position Unicode defined meaning ASCII except code position ASCII control character defined denoting control character name corresponding ASCII name meaning defined Unicode
Sometimes however Unicode characterized even Unicode standard

This slogan mainly try convey idea Unicode meant character code way ASCII though character repertoire ASCII hopelessly insufficient universal use opposite using different code different system application different language
Unicode defines character Each character code number specific range
These code number presented using different transfer encoding internally memory Unicode character usually represented using one two quantity per character depending character range sometimes using one quantity per character
ASCII Unicode two character encoding
Basically standard represent difference character binary written stored transmitted read digital medium
The main difference two way encode character number bit use
ASCII originally used seven bit encode character
This later increased eight Extended ASCII address apparent inadequacy original
In contrast Unicode us variable bit encoding program choose encoding
Using bit let use character expense larger file fewer bit give limited choice save lot space
Using fewer bit
ASCII would probably best encoding large document English
One main reason Unicode problem arose many extended ASCII program
Unless using prevalent page used Microsoft software company likely encounter problem character appearing box
Unicode virtually eliminates problem character code point standardized
Another major advantage Unicode maximum accommodate huge number character
Because Unicode currently contains written language still room even
This includes typical script like English even script like Arabic
Chinese Japanese many variant also represented within Unicode
So Unicode replaced anytime soon
In order maintain compatibility older ASCII already widespread use time Unicode designed way first eight bit matched popular ASCII page
So open ASCII encoded file Unicode still get correct character encoded file
This facilitated adoption Unicode lessened impact adopting new encoding standard already using ASCII
Summary Taken From ASCII defines character Unicode contains repertoire character
java provides support Unicode support world wide alphabet
Hence size char java byte
And range
ASCII American Standard Code Information Interchange common format text file computer Internet
In ASCII file alphabetic numeric special character represented binary number string seven
possible character defined

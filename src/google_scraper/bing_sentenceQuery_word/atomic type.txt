Atomic data data element represent lowest level detail
For example daily sale report individual item sold would atomic data rollups invoice summary total invoice aggregate data
The word atomic data based atom chemistry physic smallest particle characterized chemical element
In natural philosophy atom indestructible building block universe
In light atomic data smallest data detail come complete meaning
In field computer science specifically computer programming atomic data refers data type whether action object longer broken smaller unites
In word data type longer divisible changeable always whole
In general data type classification specific type information property
Depending programming language used whether C Java Assembly Language information varies
Generally three type data
They integer data type whole number fraction component floating point data type contain decimal point character refers readable text
Another atomic data Boolean data type refers two value
Atomic data type common set property include class name total data size byte order referring bit arranged reside memory precision refers significant part data offset location significant data within entire data padding identifies data significant
In different programming language atomic data type different manifestation
For instance structure query language SQL atomic function either completes operation totally return original state interruption like power failure occur
In system based Unix operating system atomic data type changed
In another language like Lisp atomic data type refers basic unit code executes
Relational database best example atomic data stored retrieved form larger set called aggregate data
There need manage access data describe represent property object whether real imaginary computer system
A database essence record keeping system one example object referred term item information
An object could client corporation many characteristic
Data inside database structured separate unassociated atomic data item contains relevant information
The database structure called relationship query executed combine atomic data aggregate data report generate statistical analysis organization draw profile many different aspect
Atomic data come several source
It come table come different table within database
The internet teeming atomic data traversing information superhighway every single second
Search engine use special code called crawler spider index atomic data later used ranking page user type keywords search engine

In Effective Java book state The language specification guarantee reading writing variable atomic unless variable type JLS
What atomic mean context Java programming programming general
Here example example often clearer long explanation
Suppose variable type
The following operation atomic operation Indeed variable written using two separate operation one writes first bit second one writes last bit
That mean another thread might read value see intermediate state
Making operation atomic consists using synchronization mechanism order make sure operation seen thread single atomic
splittable part operation
That mean thread operation made atomic either see value assignment assignment
But never intermediate value
A simple way make variable volatile Or synchronize every access variable Or replace AtomicLong Atomic operation mean operation appears instantaneous perspective thread
You need worry partly complete operation guarantee applies
It something appears rest system occur instantaneously fall categorisation computing process
To quote linked article Atomicity guarantee isolation concurrent process
Additionally atomic operation commonly definition either successfully change state system apparent effect
So instance context database system one commits meaning push changeset update relational database change either submitted none event failure way data become corrupt consequential lock queue next operation different write read fact
In context variable threading much applied memory
Your quote highlight need expected behaviour instance
In ancient philosophy atom ultimate unit matter complex view material reality based
In computer programming atomic describes unitary action object essentially indivisible unchangeable whole irreducible
Here usage In Structured Query Language atomic function one either complete return original state power interruption abnormal end occurs
In Unix operating system atomic operation one change take place time setting mask receiving signal change mask
In programming language including Lisp atom basic unit executable code data
An operation processor simultaneously read location write bus operation
This prevents processor device writing reading memory operation complete
Atomic implies indivisibility irreducibility atomic operation must performed entirely performed
Just found post helpful
An operation acting shared memory atomic completes single step relative thread
When atomic store performed shared memory thread observe modification
When atomic load performed shared variable read entire value appeared single moment time
If several thread executing method code guarantee thread calling either read
On hand code long thread calling could read random value statement guaranteed atomic JVM could write first bit last bit two operation thread might observe

In operation set operation appears rest system occur without interrupted
Atomicity guarantee
It relevant
Additionally atomic operation commonly either successfully change state system apparent effect
In concurrent system process access shared object time
Because multiple process accessing single object may arise situation one process accessing object another process change content
This example demonstrates need linearizability
In linearizable system although operation overlap shared object operation appears take place instantaneously
Linearizability strong correctness condition constrains output possible object accessed multiple process concurrently
It safety property ensures operation complete unexpected unpredictable manner
If system linearizable allows programmer reason system
Atomicity often enforced whether hardware level building protocol software level using
Thus atomic operation necessarily occur instantaneously
The benefit come system behaves operation occurred instantly separated pause
This make system consistent
Because implementation detail may ignored user except insofar affect performance
If operation atomic user also need understand cope sporadic extraneous behaviour caused interaction concurrent operation nature likely hard reproduce debug
Linearizability first introduced
It encompassed restrictive definition atomic atomic operation one interrupted concurrent operation usually vague operation considered begin end
An atomic object understood immediately completely sequential definition set operation run parallel always appear occur one inconsistency may emerge
Specifically linearizability guarantee system operation operation individually preserve invariant system whole
A concurrent system consists collection process communicating shared data structure object
Linearizability important concurrent system object may accessed multiple process time programmer need able reason expected result
An execution concurrent system result ordered sequence completed operation
A sequence made object set process
An invocation thought start operation response signaled end operation
Each invocation function subsequent response
This used model use object
Suppose example two thread A B attempt grab lock backing already taken
This would modeled thread invoking lock operation thread receiving response one successful one
A history one invocation immediate response invocation response considered take place instantaneously
A sequential history trivial reason real concurrency previous example sequential thus hard reason
This linearizability come
A history σ linear order completed operation In word Note first two bullet point match operation appear happen order
It last point unique linearizability thus major contribution Herlihy Wing
Let u look two way reordering locking example
Reordering B invocation A response yield sequential history
This easy reason operation happen obvious order
Unfortunately match sequential definition object match semantics program A successfully obtained lock B subsequently aborted
This another correct sequential history
It also linearization
Note definition linearizability precludes response precede invocation reordered since original history response invocation reorder wish
Hence original history indeed linearizable
An object opposed history linearizable valid history use linearized
Note much harder assertion prove
Consider following history two object interacting lock This history valid point A B hold lock moreover reordered valid sequential history without violating ordering rule
Therefore linearizable
However serializability B unlock operation may moved A original lock valid history assuming object begin history locked state While weird reordering sensible provided alternative mean communicating A Linearizability better considering individual object separately reordering restriction ensure multiple linearizable object considered whole still linearizable
This definition linearizability equivalent following This alternative usually much easier prove
It also much easier reason user largely due intuitiveness
This property occurring instantaneously indivisibly lead use term alternative longer linearizable
In example linearization point counter built linearization point first successful update
The counter built using locking considered linearize moment lock held since potentially conflicting operation excluded running period
Processors used implement
The ability temporarily inhibit ensuring currently running also suffices
These instruction used directly compiler operating system writer also abstracted exposed bytecodes library function language Most include store operation atomic respect memory
These include store string operation
Should high priority interrupt occur portion store complete operation must completed interrupt level returned
The routine process interrupt must access memory changed
It important take account writing interrupt routine
When multiple instruction must completed without interruption CPU instruction temporarily disables interrupt used
This must kept instruction interrupt must avoid unacceptable response time interrupt even losing interrupt
This mechanism sufficient environment since CPU interfere process regardless whether interrupt occur
Further presence uninterruptible operation present security risk potentially chained create
The provide simple atomic read writes incrementing decrementing guaranteed atomic
More complex atomic operation available provides
The provides instruction used implement atomic memory access using implemented processor track memory access specific address
However context switch occurs call documentation note fail indicating operation retried
The easiest way achieve linearizability running group primitive operation
Strictly independent operation carefully permitted overlap critical section provided violate linearizability
Such approach must balance cost large number benefit increased parallelism
Another approach favoured researcher yet widely used software industry design linearizable object using native atomic primitive provided hardware
This potential maximise available parallelism minimise synchronisation cost requires mathematical proof show object behave correctly
A promising hybrid two provide abstraction
As critical section user mark sequential code must run isolation thread
The implementation ensures code executes atomically
This style abstraction common interacting database instance using annotating method Transactional ensure enclosed database interaction occur single
Transactional memory go step ensuring memory interaction occur atomically
As database transaction issue arise regarding composition transaction especially database transaction
A common theme designing linearizable object provide interface either operation succeeds completely fails nothing
database refer principle
If operation fails usually due concurrent operation user must retry usually performing different operation
For example To demonstrate power necessity Linearizability consider simple counter different process increment
We would like implement counter object multiple process access
Many common system make use counter keep track number time event occurred
The counter object accessed multiple process two available operation
We attempt implement counter object using Our first attempt see following implementation using one Shared Register among process
The naive implementation read Register R This simple implementation linearizable demonstrated following example
Imagine two process running accessing single counter object initialized value finished writing new value back register may become suspended meanwhile second process running The second process finished running first process continues running left In example two process invoked increment command however value object increased instead
One increment operation lost result system linearizable
The example show need carefully thinking implementation data structure Linearizability effect correctness system
To implement Linearizable Atomic Counter object modify previous implementation Process P use Register R Each process Increments Reads according following algorithm This implementation solves problem original implementation
In system increment operation linearized write step
The Linearization point increment operation operation writes new value Register R The Read operation linearized point system value returned Read equal sum value stored Register R This trivial example
In real system operation complex error introduced extremely subtle
For example reading value memory may actually implemented two read two memory location
If process read first bit read second bit value memory get changed neither original value new value value
Furthermore specific order process run change result making error difficult detect reproduce
Most system provide atomic instruction read memory location compare value expected one provided user writes new value two match returning whether update succeeded
We use fix counter algorithm follows Since occurs appears occur instantaneously another process update location guaranteed fail
Many system provide atomic instruction read memory location unconditionally writes new value old value plus one return old value
We use fix counter algorithm follows Using increment always better requires fewer memory reference one shown even though Herlihy earlier proved better certain algorithm ca implemented using
So equivalent instruction may better choice one one
Another approach turn naive algorithm preventing thread disrupting using
Once fixing counter algorithm This strategy work expected lock prevents thread updating value released
However compared direct use atomic operation suffer significant overhead due lock contention
To improve program performance may therefore good idea replace simple critical section atomic operation done counter instead way around unfortunately significant improvement guaranteed algorithm easily become complicated worth effort

In used control access common resource multiple system operating system
A trivial semaphore plain variable changed example incremented decremented toggled depending condition
The variable used condition control access system resource
A useful way think semaphore used system record many unit particular resource available coupled operation adjust record
avoid unit required become free necessary wait unit resource becomes available
Semaphores useful tool prevention race condition however use mean guarantee program free problem
Semaphores allow arbitrary resource count called semaphore restricted value called used implement
The semaphore concept invented found widespread use variety
It also used control mechanism controller example computer
Suppose library identical study room used one student time
Students must request room front desk wish use study room
If room free student wait desk someone relinquishes room
When student finished using room student must return desk indicate one room become free
In simplest implementation clerk front desk know number free room available know correctly student actually use room signed return done
When student request room clerk decrease number
When student release room clerk increase number
The room used long desired possible book room ahead time
In scenario front desk represents counting semaphore room resource student represent
The value semaphore scenario initially room empty
When student request room granted access value semaphore changed
After next student come drop
If someone request room resulting value semaphore would negative forced wait room freed count increased
If one room released several student waiting method used select one occupy room like FIFO flipping coin
And course student need inform clerk releasing room really leaving otherwise awkward situation student process leaving room packing textbook etc
another student enters room leave
When used control access resource semaphore track resource free keep track resource free
Some mechanism possibly involving semaphore may required select particular free resource
The paradigm especially powerful semaphore count may serve useful trigger number different action
The librarian may turn light study hall student remaining may place sign say room busy room occupied
The success protocol requires application follow correctly
Fairness safety likely compromised practically mean program may behave slowly act erratically even single process act incorrectly
This includes Even process follow rule may still occur different resource managed different semaphore process need use one resource time illustrated
Counting semaphore equipped two operation historically denoted P V see alternative name
Operation V semaphore operation P
The value semaphore number unit resource currently available
The P operation resource protected semaphore becomes available time resource immediately claimed
The V operation inverse make resource available process finished using
One important property semaphore value changed except using V P operation
A simple way understand P V operation Many operating system provide efficient semaphore primitive unblock waiting process semaphore incremented
This mean process waste time checking semaphore value unnecessarily
The counting semaphore concept extended ability claim return one unit semaphore technique implemented
The modified V P operation follows using square bracket indicate operation appear indivisible perspective process However remainder section refers semaphore unary V P operation unless otherwise specified
To avoid semaphore associated process usually semantics
If process performs P operation semaphore value zero process added semaphore queue execution suspended
When another process increment semaphore performing V operation process queue one removed queue resume execution
When process different priority queue may ordered priority highest priority process taken queue first
If implementation ensure atomicity increment decrement comparison operation risk increment decrement forgotten semaphore value becoming negative
Atomicity may achieved using machine instruction able semaphore single operation
In absence hardware instruction atomic operation may synthesized use
On system atomic operation ensured temporarily suspending disabling hardware
This approach work multiprocessor system possible two program sharing semaphore run different processor time
To solve problem multiprocessor system locking variable used control access semaphore
The locking variable manipulated using command
Consider variable boolean variable
accessed marked true
Thus semaphore
One imagine stoplight signal train station
In case signal green one enter train station
If yellow red color train station accessed
Consider system support ten user
Whenever user log P called decrementing semaphore
Whenever user log V called incrementing representing login slot become available
When user wishing log must wait login request enqueued onto FIFO queue used ensure request enqueued order
Whenever becomes greater login slot available login request dequeued user owning request allowed log
In one process producer generates data item another process consumer receives us
They communicate using queue maximum size subject following condition The semaphore solution problem track state queue two semaphore number empty place queue number element queue
To maintain integrity may lower never higher actual number empty place queue may lower never higher actual number item queue
Empty place item represent two kind resource empty box full box semaphore maintain control resource
The binary semaphore ensures integrity state queue compromised example two producer attempting add item empty queue simultaneously thereby corrupting internal state
Alternatively could used place binary semaphore
The initially initially initially
The producer following repeatedly The consumer following repeatedly Below substantive example Note may much lower actual number empty place queue example case many producer decremented waiting turn filling empty place
Note always hold equality producer consumer executing critical section
The canonical name V P come initial word
V generally explained increase
Several explanation offered P including test try pas grab
Dijkstra earliest paper subject give passing meaning release meaning It also mention terminology taken used railroad signal
Dijkstra subsequently wrote intended stand short literally try reduce parallel term used case try decrease
In English textbook operation called respectively
In software engineering practice often called standard library us
Some text call match original Dutch initial
A essentially thing binary semaphore sometimes us basic implementation
The difference used
While binary semaphore may used mutex mutex specific thread locked mutex supposed unlock
This constraint make possible implement additional feature mutexes

How atomic operation work hood
Are atomic operation
I seeking description least common divisor atomic operation
What atomic operation share
Atomicity concept occurs several place I suspect thinking atomic operation code meaning
One fundamantal property Database transaction Atomicity see description property transaction
In case lot database cleverness lock almost certainly imply waiting two thread control two process want get data
When come line code I guess thinking declaration fictitious language one thread another Can say anything second thread print
We might accept either le happy get number high order byte low order byte conceptually would result integer assignment
Different programming language free define whatever semantics wish conceivable would accept whatever natural behaviour CPU work say bit int atomic long might something much cleverer CPU provide atomic operation I see much alternative kind waiting want fake atomicity eg
Java synchronized keyword
If talking atomic operation used synchronization mechanism mutexes semaphore etc supported OS single CPU machine hardware multi CPU
On single CPU machine instruction sequence made atomic sense interrupted middle
timer interrupt give switch another thread interrupt shut
This mean synchronization primitive written quite simply CPU enters kernel mode access interrupt control register
In multi core machine complex
Then instruction truly atomic across CPUs
This requires CPUs one executing atomic instruction flush relevant part cache RAM
This flushing make synchronization expensive architecture
The instruction take form Bit test set one operation
This enough implement simple mutex
Even two thread different executing test set operation time address one get result bit unset set
That thread one owns mutex
Depends atomic operation talking
If talking stuff test set instruction included popular ISAs I think

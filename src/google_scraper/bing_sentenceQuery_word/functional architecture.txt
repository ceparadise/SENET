concept
Two early important example The term architecture computer literature traced work Lyle Johnson Mohammad Usman Khan member Machine Organization department IBM main research center
Johnson opportunity write proprietary research communication time known Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
To describe level detail discussing luxuriously embellished computer noted description format instruction type hardware parameter speed enhancement level system architecture term seemed useful machine Subsequently Brooks Stretch designer started Chapter book Planning Computer System Project Stretch ed
Buchholz writing Computer architecture like architecture art determining need user structure designing meet need effectively possible within economic technological constraint
Brooks went help develop called line computer architecture became noun defining user need know
Later computer user came use term many way
The earliest computer architecture designed paper directly built final hardware form
Later computer architecture prototype physically built form TTL prototype tweaked committing final hardware form
As new computer architecture typically built tested computer architecture inside FPGA committing final hardware form
The discipline computer architecture three main subcategories There type computer architecture
The following type used bigger company like Intel count computer architecture The purpose design computer maximizes performance keeping power consumption check cost low relative amount expected performance also reliable
For many aspect considered includes instruction set design functional organization logic design implementation
The implementation involves integrated circuit design packaging power cooling
Optimization design requires familiarity compiler operating system logic design packaging
An instruction set architecture ISA interface computer software hardware also viewed programmer view machine
Computers understand Java programming language used
A processor understands instruction encoded numerical fashion usually
Software tool translate high level language instruction processor understand
Besides instruction ISA defines item computer available
memory
Instructions locate available item register index name memory addressing mode
The ISA computer usually described small instruction manual describes instruction encoded
Also may define short vaguely mnemonic name instruction
The name recognized software development tool called
An assembler computer program translates form ISA form
also widely available usually software program isolate correct malfunction binary computer program
ISAs vary quality completeness
A good ISA compromise programmer convenience easy code understand size code much code required specific action cost computer interpret instruction complexity mean space needed disassemble instruction speed computer larger disassemblers come longer disassemble time
For example ISAs like ISA subtracts one value value zero value return higher value inexpensive fast however ISAs like convenient helpful looking size ISA
Memory organization defines instruction interact memory memory interacts
During design software emulator run program written proposed instruction set
Modern emulator measure size cost speed determine particular ISA meeting goal
Computer organization help optimize product
For example software engineer need know processing power processor
They may need optimize software order gain performance lowest price
This require quite detailed analysis computer organization
For example SD card designer might need arrange card data processed fastest possible way
Computer organization also help plan selection processor particular project
Multimedia project may need rapid data access virtual machine may need fast interrupt
Sometimes certain task need additional component well
For example computer capable running virtual machine need hardware memory different virtual computer kept separated
Computer organization feature also affect power consumption processor cost
Once instruction set designed practical machine must developed
This design process called
Implementation usually considered architectural design rather hardware
Implementation broken several step For entire implementation process organized differently often referred
The exact form computer system depends constraint goal
Computer architecture usually trade standard power versus performance cost memory capacity latency amount time take information one node travel source throughput
Sometimes consideration feature size weight reliability expandability also factor
The common scheme depth power analysis figure keep power consumption low maintaining adequate performance
Modern computer performance often described IPC instruction per
This measure efficiency architecture clock frequency
Since faster rate make faster computer useful measurement
Older computer IPC count low
Simple modern processor easily reach near processor may reach three five IPC executing several instruction per clock cycle
Counting machine language instruction would misleading varying amount work different ISAs
The instruction standard measurement count ISA actual machine language instruction unit measurement usually based speed computer architecture
Many people used measure computer speed clock rate usually MHz GHz
This refers cycle per second main clock CPU
However metric somewhat misleading machine higher clock rate may necessarily greater performance
As result manufacturer moved away clock speed measure performance
Other factor influence speed mix speed available memory type order instruction program
There two main type speed latency throughput
Latency time start process completion
Throughput amount work done per unit time
guaranteed maximum response time system electronic event like disk drive finish moving data
Performance affected wide range design choice example processor usually make latency worse make throughput better
Computers control machinery usually need low interrupt latency
These computer operate environment fail operation completed specified amount time
For example brake must begin braking within predictable short time brake pedal sensed else failure brake occur
take factor account measuring time computer take run series test program
Although benchmarking show strength choose computer
Often measured machine split different measure
For example one system might handle scientific application quickly another might render video game smoothly
Furthermore designer may target add special feature product hardware software permit specific benchmark execute quickly offer similar advantage general task
Power efficiency another important measurement modern computer
A higher power efficiency often traded lower speed higher cost
The typical measurement referring power consumption computer architecture million instruction per second per watt
Modern circuit le power required per transistor number transistor per chip grows
This transistor put new chip requires power supply requires new pathway built power
However number transistor per chip starting increase slower rate
Therefore power efficiency starting become important important fitting transistor single chip
Recent processor design shown emphasis put focus power efficiency rather cramming many transistor single chip possible
In world embedded computer power efficiency long important goal next throughput latency
Increases publicly released refresh rate grown slowly past year respect vast leap power consumption reduction miniaturization demand
This led new demand longer battery life reduction size due mobile technology produced greater rate
This change focus greater refresh rate power consumption miniaturization shown significant reduction power consumption much reported Intel release dropped power consumption benchmark watt watt
Comparing processing speed increase GHz GHz seen focus research development shifting away refresh rate moving towards consuming le power taking le space

A architectural model identifies function interaction corresponding need
These function used reference different develop part enterprise
In way enterprise architect able create integrated organizational environment
When integrated software system need developed implemented number task corresponding responsibility normally divided The described work division reality much complex also involves actor outline involvement people different background creating software system enables organization reach business objective
A wide variety material produced different actor within system development process need exchanged understood multiple actor
Especially field software engineering many tool Tool CAME ACME Rapide method developed extensively used
Also transition software engineer step computer programmer step already highly formalized instance development
Setting strategic objective step corresponding search business opportunity weakness subject extensively discussed investigated hundred year
Concepts like commonly known extensively used context
These strategic input must used development good enterprise design step used software design implementation respectively
Recent study shown enterprise architecture developed number different method technique
Before method technique discussed detail definition given This definition emphasizes use architecture rich strategic information source improvement business process development needed information system
If defined maintained implemented effectively institutional blueprint assist optimizing interdependency interrelationship among organization business operation underlying IT support operation
Having read definition functional software architecture beginning entry see functional software architecture type enterprise architecture used rich reference development integrated information system
Naming functional software architecture encourages practitioner use strategic input
A formal mapping functional software architecture type therefore needed
In way formal use reuse enterprise architecture strategic input software architecture realized
As boundary enterprise extended becomes increasingly important common big picture needed business people IT system activity developed shared party involved
A functional software architecture breaking organization business function corresponding IT need
In way enterprise engineer provides rich schematic reference used software engineer development
The development functional software architecture done number combined method technique
Filling gap enterprise engineer software engineer use different combination method technique main objective
However objective reached combined method result clear rich functional software architecture developed used party
Optimizing internal external business process process reengineering one main objective enterprise time high external pressure
A involves value creating activity certain input output interconnected thereby jointly contribute final outcome product service process
Process reengineering cover variety perspective change organization
It concerned redesign strategic value adding process system policy organizational structure optimize process organization
Within area formal methodology method technique designed tested extensively used order offer organization reusable business process solution These method le suited modeling enterprise underlying process
So suited development information technology system needed effective efficient designed process
More important using time consuming enterprise methodology information software engineer use unclear result development efficiency enabling IT system
Before give answer question short description listed method given
provides template interconnected modeling construct encode business people IT aspect enterprise requirement
This done multiple perspective information view function view resource view organization view
These construct used structure facilitate design implementation detailed IT system
The division different view make clarifying reference enterprise software engineer
It show information need different enterprise functionality activity process operation corresponding resource
In way easily determined fulfill information need certain activity process
technique first developed modeling manufacturing system
It already used Airforce
Initially different notation model enterprise certain viewpoint
These functional data dynamic process analysis respectively
In past decade number tool technique integration notation developed incremental way
IDEF clearly show business process flow variety decomposed business function corresponding information input output actor
Like CIMOSA also us different enterprise view
Moreover IDEF easily transformed development system
positive characteristic make powerful method development functional software architecture
known tool model manufacturing system
They highly expressive provide good formalism modeling
The advantageous property simple representation state concurrent system transition capability model duration transition
Petri net therefore used model certain business process corresponding state transition activity output
Moreover Petri Nets used model different software system transition system
In way programmer use schematic coding reference
In recent year number attempt shown Petri net contribute development business process integration
One Model Blue methodology developed Chinese Research Laboratory outline importance model driven business integration emerging approach building integrated platform
A mapping Model Blue business view equivalent Petri Net also shown indicates research close gap business IT
However instead Petri Nets rather use Model Blue IT view derived business view transformation engine
broadly accepted modeling language development software system application
The called object oriented community also try use UML enterprise modeling purpose
They emphasize use enterprise object business object complex enterprise system made
A collection object corresponding interaction represent complex business system process
Where Petri Nets focus interaction state object UML focus business object
Sometimes called enterprise building block includes resource process goal rule metamodels
Despite fact UML way used model integrated software system argued reality business modeled software modeling language
In reaction object oriented community make business extension UML adapts language
UEML derived UML proposed business modeling language
The question remains business transformation right thing
It earlier said UML combination pure business method better alternative
EFD used modeling technique representation enterprise function corresponding interaction
Different business process modeled representation use function module trigger
A starting business process delivers different input different function
A process flowing function creates multiple output
Enterprise function diagram hereby give detailed representation business process corresponding function input output trigger
In way EFD many similarity diagram also represent hierarchical way business process combination function trigger
Difference EFD place business function organization hierarchical perspective outline downstream certain process organization
On contrary diagram show responsibility certain business function use arrow
Also clear representation input output every sub function
EFD possibly could used business software modeling language like UML
The major resemblance IDEF modeling tool indicates done
However research needed improve EFD technique way formal mapping UML made
complementary use IDEF UML contributed acceptance IDEF end
A similar study done EFD UML

Difference requirement context designing software system
Give example case
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Let elaborate
An example would A related system may The functional requirement relates system functionality
The requirement system
Typically requirement fall area A complete list available Wikipedia entry
requirement sometimes defined term metric something measured system make tangible
requirement may also describe aspect system relate execution rather evolution time
maintainability extensibility documentation etc
functional requirement main thing user expects software example application banking application application able create new account update account delete account etc
functional requirement detailed specified system design acquirement straight forward requirement system rather related usability way example banking application major requirement availability application available time possible
Functional requirement specifies function system system component must able perform
It documented various way
The common one written description document use case
Use case textual enumeration list well diagram describing user action
Each use case illustrates behavioural scenario one functional requirement
Often though analyst begin eliciting set use case analyst derive functional requirement must implemented allow user perform use case
Functional requirement system
It may A typical functional requirement contain unique name number brief summary rationale
This information used help reader understand requirement needed track requirement development system
already explained requirement
I add
requirement requirement functional requirement
This requirement specifies criterion used
requirement form overall property system whole particular aspect specific function
The system overall property commonly mark difference whether development project succeeded failed
requirement divided two main category Whether requirement expressed functional requirement may depend Ex
A system may required present user display number record database
This functional requirement
How update number need requirement
If number need updated real time system architect must ensure system capable updating displayed record count within acceptably short interval number record changing
References activity system must perform Functional requirement related technical functionality system
requirement requirement specifies criterion used judge operation system particular condition rather specific behavior
For example consider shopping site adding item cart browsing different item applying offer deal successfully placing order come functional requirement
Where performance system peak hour time taken system retrieve data DB security user data ability system handle large number user login come non functional requirement
I think client developer side regarding functionality user software developer client
requirement given client provided developer run system smoothly
safety security flexibility scalability availability etc

The methodical series step engineer use creating functional product process
The process highly part process often need repeated many time another entered though part get iterated number cycle given project may vary
process often iterative basic science mathematics engineering science applied convert resource optimally meet stated objective
Among fundamental element establishment objective criterion synthesis analysis construction testing evaluation
The step tend get articulated subdivided illustrated different way generally reflect certain core principle regarding underlying concept respective sequence interrelationship
One framing engineering design process delineates following stage
Others noting different author research literature textbook define different phase design process varying activity occurring within suggested model
A standard summary process European engineering design literature
In example key aspect concept evaluation prototyping subset extension one listed step
It also important understand well articulation process different terminology employed may varying degree overlap affect step get stated explicitly deemed high level versus subordinate given model
Various stage design process even earlier involve significant amount time spent locating information
Consideration given existing applicable literature problem success associated existing solution cost marketplace need
The source information relevant including existing solution
effective technique solution available market
Other source information include Internet local available government document personal organization vendor catalog individual available
Establishing design conducting sometimes termed deemed related activity one important element design process task often performed time feasibility analysis
The design requirement control design product process developed throughout engineering design process
These include basic thing like function attribute determined assessing user need
Some design requirement include hardware software parameter
In case carried schedule resource plan estimate next phase developed
The feasibility study evaluation analysis potential proposed project support process
It outline analysis alternative method achieving desired outcome
The feasibility study help narrow scope project identify best scenario
A feasibility report generated following Post Feasibility Review performed
The purpose feasibility assessment determine whether engineer project proceed
This based two criterion project need based achievable idea need within
It important engineer experience good judgment involved portion feasibility study
A concept study often phase project planning includes producing idea taking account pro con implementing idea
This stage project done minimize likelihood error manage cost evaluate potential success intended project
In event engineering issue problem defined potential solution must identified
These solution found using mental process idea generated
In fact step often termed Concept Generation
The following widely used technique Various generated idea must undergo step utilizes various tool compare contrast relative strength weakness possible alternative
The preliminary design design includes also called often bridge gap design conception detailed design particularly case level conceptualization achieved ideation sufficient full evaluation
So task overall system configuration defined project may provide early project configuration
This notably varies lot field industry product
During detailed design optimization parameter part created change preliminary design focus creating general framework build project
Blanchard Fabrycky describe The whats initiating conceptual design produce hows conceptual design evaluation effort applied feasible conceptual design concept
Next hows taken preliminary design mean allocated requirement

What common design computer system OS programming language DBMS
What common implementation computer system OS programming language DBMS
Thanks
I would get hung terminology
Google good definition Design search design noun plan drawing produced show look function working building garment object built made
verb decide upon look functioning building garment object typically making detailed drawing
Actual drawing sometimes exist think flowchart design I familiar typically written description
Implementation process putting decision plan effect execution
As specific question In context making question process followed beginning project requirement defined technology used resource needed organization component constructed
The next stage info step used begin constructing component
However especially Web application difference design implementation slightly change
The refers functionality application function executed backstage
The refers aesthetic decision Web app styling font image etc
The difference design implementation stem foolish idea people perpetuate approach building software like building bridge design bridge bunch construction worker implement
In reality software development design
Generally yeah understood people belong group
Some people consider requirement gathering part design others
The user interface necessarily exclusive output design phase even subscribing foolish concept
Many software platform UIs
library
The common element computer system use math move information around
That really thing common
Not project use database operating system
embedded software programmed assembly I would lump programming language considering OPs understanding subject run platform C compiler available
Some computer system even run analog system obscure specialized purpose
Not use microprocessor system older elevator controller built relay much simple computer system

For purpose project design mean visual graphical design site well implementation detail underlie
Your design document describe finished site look like make work
There alternative view design prove helpful
This view design clear detailed complete could principle mail team abroad could implement website without consulting client
The idea leave nothing implicit unspoken understanding party
An important part design set image picture want page look like perhaps common element logo navbar
You create mockups favorite editor tool Photoshop Pixlr Illustrator Power Point etc
Once done save export web image format GIF JPEG PNG upload folder named folder shared team account
Here set mockup image
If received necessary image text client logo history organization feel free use dummy image text
Hopefully fill coding
For focus layout page size alignment font color border
You use image design document picture really worth word describing page layout
The final product design phase webpage contains structured essay combination text image mockup page
The document webpage contain component Note form JavaScript application using JavaScript process form data
Do get confused
You know writing JavaScript code
Here seen still see course
Please note item must constructed entirely copied external website Web though modify code class material
Once fulfill minimum requirement code allowed get code web source attribution incorporate certain advanced component
image gallery transition count part minimum requirement
Now know design document read following section get detail part document
Your design say create clear complete concise
Design includes organization navigation site
What page
How connected
What sequence step user need take common task
For example user often visit site find next game describe path follow get information
In case requirement user find looking quickly easily solution site organizational navigational scheme allows
Important process informed knowledge user behavioral pattern studied
An excellent description design choice contain reference pattern learned reading
Design also cover layout appearance page
To guide process go back reading lecture note layout strategy
Think bit target audience remember may certain disability thus design accessibility issue mind see reading
Also remember every user precisely size screen think page layout flexible still look okay variety size
Document decision make
Do afraid specific design wo allowed change mind later
You may change mind coding document document submit along code
See
Rather duplicating code element site appear multiple page handle repetitious item using shared file JavaScript code shared file using SSI
Repetitious element include thing like Depending project achieving modularity may large task
Therefore implementation modularity shared partner since assigning one partner may result uneven work load
In professional setting many people may involved implementing website designed
To avoid stepping one another implementation must planned determining order part built time
Some part may built early allow testing subsequent part depend
We also need deadline various part management need know far team behind schedule software project almost never time
Finally need determine build part everything get built nothing get assigned two people
In project even though team two issue arise
Ideally good plan allow two teammate work independently without meet constantly discus page
call page I link
like
Thus design document must also include
The plan must cover following Our intention plan helpful make sure
A good way organize information create table column file name file description one line description deadline assigned person item
The organizational scheme similar example point clearly concrete name file
Your document saved file named uploaded folder folder team account
Use subfolder store mockup file
Make sure image saved Web format GIF PNG JPEG Photoshop proprietary format size big
Be sure submitted web page
It surprisingly common student submit work missing broken image missing CSS like
You practiced skill homework far use
Use following URL check submission If mockups large width height use attribute make fit page make link clicked show image new page
See due date
The lateness policy may turn hour late penalty
Please make change document submission deadline
While need make change design plan go separate document submitted end coding phase
Thus keep track change document
Your document include component described section
Your mockups reflect text description page close possible coded page eventually look like
We look well mockups convey purpose goal website well whether appropriate intended audience
For example one target audience child well color font image general layout speak audience cheerful bright overcrowded etc
Your writing formal clear concise
You make sure error spelling grammar punctuation mechanic writing
These example drawn earlier semester course somewhat different may helpful
Here example project featured
Notice design document close final website change described code submitted

Phase In established
This phase start requirement document delivered requirement phase map requirement architecture
The defines component interface behavior
The deliverable design document architecture
The design document describes plan implement requirement
This phase represents phase
Details computer programming language environment machine package application architecture distributed architecture layering memory size platform algorithm data structure global type definition interface many engineering detail established
The design may include usage existing component
The design phase summarized Table page
The architectural team expand upon information established requirement document
Using typical atypical scenario provided requirement document performance accomplished well complexity implementation
Obviously action done many time need done correctly efficiently
A seldom used action need implemented correctly obvious level performance required
The requirement document must guide decision process
An example seldom used action must done high performance emergency shutdown nuclear reactor
Analyzing necessary complexity allows many thing remain simple turn eventually lead higher quality product
The architecture team also convert typical scenario test plan
In approach team given complete requirement document must also indicate implementation team
A critical implementation priority lead task done right
If fails product fails
If succeeds product might succeed
At least confidence level team producing successful product increase
This keep implementation team focused
Exactly information conveyed skill based experience science based fundamental foundation
The importance priority setting become evident theory chapter presented later

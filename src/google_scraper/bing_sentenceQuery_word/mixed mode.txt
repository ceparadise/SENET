A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

Why Java running mode say version
When I see mean JVM truly load pure server mode
server mode mean mixed
Those different setting
Mixed mean JVM mix compiled interpreted code
You could optionally switch fully interpreted mode switch usually want
Server mode mean run
The general assumption VMs optimization done mind
So see mixed mode sign VM running
EDIT If want check really running try output At least Sun VM OpenJDK give hint
You might notice always run Server VM bit system
Both client server Hotspot compiler included Java Runtime Environment
By default client compiler enabled intense application run server compiler runtime option

I looking download list mixed mode assembly regular I assume
My project going use library compiled
I question Allways check msdn first
Mixed mode mean assembly run managed unmanaged code
Setups Windows Framework You kinda answered question My project going use library compiled
There way produce assembly pure IL
The final part creating assembly using reflection involves call
If pas portableExecutableKind argument create assembly
You avoid problem cause also passing

Needless say information hard Taken official What assembly
A assembly dynamic link library contains managed code native code particular processor architecture
Since contains native code loaded process match processor architecture compiled
Also see StackOverflow question
It even reference question

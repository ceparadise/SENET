An IPO chart simple effective tool programmer sometimes use designing documenting function
IPO stand input processing output IPO chart describes input processing output function
These item usually laid column input column show description data passed function argument processing column show description process function performs output column describes data returned function
For example Figure show ge price discount function saw Program
Ifpife IPO chart getRegularPrice discount function IPO Chart forthe get regular price Function IPO Chart forthe get regular price Function Function Input Processing Output An item Calculates item discount The Item discount regular price multiplying regular price Decision Structure

The pattern widely used approach describing structure information processing program process
Many introductory programming system analysis text introduce basic structure describing process
A sort process using model receives input user source computation input return result computation
In essence system separate environment thus defining input output one united mechanism
The system would divide work two category In word input may material human resource money information transformed output consumables service new information money
As consequence system becomes vulnerable misinterpretation
This theoretically contains data regard environment outside system yet practice environment contains significant variety object system unable comprehend exists outside system control
As result important understand boundary lie system environment beyond system understanding
This often various analyst would set boundary favouring point view thus creating much confusion
The view differ regard system thinking
One definition would outline system structure would Systems thinking art science making reliable inference behaviour developing increasingly deep understanding understanding underlying structure Alternatively also suggested system sense bonding remote object example trying connect crab ozone layer capital life cycle together
There five major category cited information system literature A system created result human interference
Examples would solar system well human body evolving current form A system created result human interference physically identifiable
Examples would various computing machine created human mind specific purpose
A system created result human interference physically identifiable
Examples would mathematical philosophical system created human mind specific purpose
There also social system allow human collectively achieve specific purpose
A system created human derived intangible purpose
For example family hierarchy human relationship essence create boundary natural human system
An organisation hierarchy created human specific purpose
For example company organises human together collaborate achieve specific purpose
The result system physically identifiable
There however significant link previous type
It clear idea human activity system HAS would consist variety smaller social system unique development organisation
Moreover arguably HASes include designed system computer machinery
Majority previous system would overlap
There several key characteristic come fundamental behaviour system

An IPO chart simply way describe business process information
Usually IPO chart precursor using software specific purpose
The chart three component write description component plain English code mathematical formula
Making IPO chart help understand expect get data gather process
You create simple table three box single row IPO chart
Leave room label box Input Process Output
If going track one kind data add additional row
If add row may find useful label row heading placed left first box
In input box describe whatever data want process
To give simple example could write Number hour worked
A complex example might Unique visitor website given month
Both example show data intend manipulate create usable conclusion business
In Process box describe intend data
For example Number hour worked might describe process data Multiply hour worked wage per hour
For website visitor example could write move email address unique visitor group email folder
The word process seem technical reality simply plan make input data useful
In Output box describe output want data processed
This practical result use
For hour worked data processing multiplying time hourly wage result output total money spent wage
For website visitor data processing email addressed placing folder result output send welcome email unique visitor
IPO chart come world information technology software designer use create complex software
You use IPO chart extremely complex process sophisticated aforementioned example
However keep IPO chart simple English solid understanding IPO process even execution complicated

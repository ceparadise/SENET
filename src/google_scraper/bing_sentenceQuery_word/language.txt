In together set rule specific
The formal language set symbol letter token string language may formed
The string formed alphabet called word word belong particular formal language sometimes called
A formal language often defined mean also called
The field study primarily purely aspect internal structural pattern
Formal language theory sprang linguistics way understanding syntactic regularity
In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning
The study interpretation formal language called
In mathematical logic often done term
In model theory term occur formula interpreted object within fixed compositional interpretation rule determine truth value formula derived interpretation term formula interpretation term formula becomes true

Foreign language learning attack time rather novel legislative way
A number state including Florida Kentucky New Mexico Texas recently introduced legislation would allowed high school student use computer programming course credit satisfy state current foreign language graduation requirement
In Oklahoma already fait accompli
Proponents bill argue allowing student choose computer science fulfill foreign language requirement better prepare workplace
But among important skill need student matter career considering able interact others around world
Substituting one century skill another actually hurt student help
Allowing computer science replace foreign language credit may actually hinder student ability get competitive college increasingly requiring student taken two three year foreign language high school
That sound like progress wo help student get better job
While computer coding type language important one academic educator linguistics computer science recognize coding comparable speaking another language requires interaction understanding another culture context
That conclusion even shared organization dedicated expanding participation computer science education making available school increasing participation woman underrepresented student color
The organization also advocate computer science part core curriculum high school nationwide alongside science technology engineering mathematics STEM course biology physic chemistry algebra
According state policy advocacy manager It math science anything
Computer science fit within discipline math science specifically strengthens math concept like geometry function variable well science concept experimentation
Additionally computer science breaking large problem working sequence critical thinking
Although use term programming language refer Java Python natural language
Spanish vocabulary word consistent grammatical sentence structure
In contrast typical computing language vocabulary word real work learning put word together build complex program
We agree
Programming language spoken signed language
They expression logic similar mathematical proof
As would much appropriate give student math credit successfully completing programming language course
Moreover decade research demonstrate benefit learning foreign language
Students study foreign language develop critical skill adaptability empathy communication relationship building skill applied technology field chooses pursue
It help one learn another culture enables one cross cultural bound easily appreciating understanding difference similarity
It enhances cognitive ability actually make one smarter enhancing math science even English language skill
Being able speak another language increasingly help people get job career
But take word
According Americans pervasive lack knowledge foreign culture foreign language threatens security United States well ability compete global marketplace produce informed citizenry
Business leader agree
A The World Work Jobs Pay Skills Billion People found worldwide percent job growth advanced market like going foreign national language skill competency
To sure computer science foreign language skill important
Keep foreign language requirement add computer science required course
If someone care issue share post friend colleague educator
If live one affected state send post state representative cover letter stating opposition legislation
And heard state may considering get touch ACTFL right away
We work together make language learning requirement education system help student succeed global scale

A used produce various kind
Programming language generally consist
Programming language used create implement specific
The earliest known programmable machine preceded automatic flute player described century
From early program used direct behavior machine
Thousands different programming language created mainly computer field many still created every year
Many programming language require computation specified form sequence operation perform language use form program specification form
desired result specified achieve
The description programming language usually split two component form meaning
Some language defined specification document example programming language specified Standard language dominant treated
Some language basic language defined standard extension taken dominant implementation common
A programming language notation writing specification computation
Some author restrict term programming language language express possible algorithm
Traits often considered important constitutes programming language include like define usually considered programming language
Programming language may however share syntax markup language computational semantics defined
example XML dialect
Moreover mostly used structuring document also contains Turing complete subset
The term sometimes used interchangeably programming language
However usage term varies among author including exact scope
One usage describes programming language subset computer language
In vein language used computing different goal expressing computer program generically designated computer language
For instance markup language sometimes referred computer language emphasize meant used programming
Another usage regard programming language theoretical construct programming abstract machine computer language subset thereof run physical computer finite hardware resource
emphasizes language much programming language language intended execution
He also argues textual even graphical input format affect behavior computer programming language despite fact commonly remark ignorance programming language concept reason many flaw input format
The earliest computer often programmed without help programming language writing program absolute
The program decimal binary form read toggled switch computer
Absolute machine language later termed
The next step development still closely tied specific computer
These served make program much relieved programmer tedious address calculation
The first written
An early programming language designed computer developed German
However implemented
proposed one first language ever developed
Unlike Short Code statement represented mathematical expression understandable form
However program translated every time ran making process much slower running equivalent
At developed early
A used automatically convert language machine code
The first code compiler developed computer University Manchester considered first programming language
The second autocode developed Mark called Mark Autocode
Brooker also developed autocode conjunction University Manchester
The version devised
Known EDSAC Autocode straight development Mercury Autocode adapted local circumstance noted object code optimisation diagnostics advanced time
A contemporary separate thread development developed University Manchester machine
In invented IBM
It first widely used functional implementation opposed design paper
It still popular language used program benchmark rank world
Another early programming language devised US called
It developed period
Hopper found business data processing customer uncomfortable mathematical notation early team wrote specification programming language implemented prototype
The compiler became publicly available early substantially complete
major influence design since direct descendant actual use time
The increased use language introduced requirement
These language varying degree provide facility assembly language language used perform task require direct access hardware facility still provide control structure
The period late brought development major language paradigm use Each language spawned descendant modern programming language count least one ancestry
The also saw considerable debate merit whether programming language designed support
famous letter published argued statement eliminated higher level programming language
The year relative consolidation
combined system programming
The United States government standardized system programming language derived intended use defense contractor
In Japan elsewhere vast sum spent investigating incorporated logic programming construct
The functional language community moved standardize Lisp
Rather inventing new paradigm movement elaborated upon idea invented previous decade
One important trend language design programming system increased focus use organizational unit code
Ada ML developed notable module system often wedded construct
The rapid growth created opportunity new language
originally Unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic
came used programming bytecode virtual machine became popular commercial setting promise popular time early
These development fundamentally novel rather refinement many existing language paradigm although syntax often based C family programming language
Programming language evolution continues industry research
Current direction include security reliability verification new kind modularity database integration Microsoft
computer programming language aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware detail
programming language based solving problem using constraint given program rather using written programmer
All programming language building block description data process transformation applied like addition two number selection item collection
These primitive defined syntactic semantic rule describe structure meaning respectively
A programming language surface form known
Most programming language purely textual use sequence text including word number punctuation much like written natural language
On hand programming language nature using visual relationship symbol specify program
The syntax language describes possible combination symbol form syntactically correct program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Since language textual article discus textual syntax
Programming language syntax usually defined using combination structure structure
Below simple grammar based This grammar specifies following The following example token sequence grammar
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning value complex type defined value If first line omitted program would trigger error compilation variable p would defined
But program would still syntactically correct since type declaration provide semantic information
The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The syntax programming language specified using grammar
Some language including Perl Lisp contain construct allow execution parsing phase
Languages construct allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis generally blur distinction parsing execution
In contrast Perl block may contain general computation C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The term refers meaning language opposed form
The static semantics defines restriction structure valid text hard impossible express standard syntactic formalism
For compiled language static semantics essentially include semantic rule checked compile time
Examples include checking every declared used language require declaration label arm distinct
Many important restriction type like checking identifier used appropriate context
adding integer function name call appropriate number type argument enforced defining rule called
Other form like may also part static semantics
Newer programming language like form data flow analysis part static semantics
Once data specified machine must instructed perform operation data
For example semantics may define expression evaluated value manner conditionally execute
The also known language defines various construct language produce program behavior
There many way defining execution semantics
Natural language often used specify execution semantics language commonly used practice
A significant amount academic research went allow execution semantics specified formal manner
Results field research seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia
A type system defines programming language classifies value expression manipulate type interact
The goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness program written language detecting certain incorrect operation
Any type system involves reject many incorrect program also prohibit correct albeit unusual program
In order bypass downside number language usually unchecked may used programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation different type
In typed language type system used program number language usually functional one relieving programmer need write type annotation
The formal design study type system known
A language specification every operation defines type data operation applicable implication applicable type
For example data represented many programming language dividing number string meaning rejected compiler
The invalid operation may detected program compiled static type checking rejected compiler compilation error message may detected program run dynamic type checking resulting
Many language allow function called exception handler written handle exception example always return result
A special case typed language language
These often scripting markup language one data commonly character string used symbolic numeric data
In contrast allows operation performed data generally considered sequence bit various length
language untyped include variety
In practice language considered typed point view verifying rejecting operation modern language offer degree typing
Many production language provide mean bypass subvert type system trading finer control program execution see
In expression type determined prior program executed typically
For example integer expression passed function expects string stored variable defined hold date
Statically typed language either
In first case programmer must explicitly write type certain textual position example variable
In second case compiler type expression declaration based context
Most mainstream statically typed language manifestly typed
Complete type inference traditionally associated le mainstream language
However many manifestly typed language support partial type inference example infer type certain limited case
Additionally programming language allow type automatically converted type example int used program expects float
also called determines operation run time word type associated rather
As language dynamically typed language require programmer write explicit type annotation expression
Among thing may permit single variable refer value different type different point program execution
However type automatically detected piece code actually executed potentially making difficult
example dynamically typed language
allows value one type treated another example treating number
This occasionally useful also allow kind program fault go undetected even
prevents
An attempt perform operation wrong type value raise error
Strongly typed language often termed
An alternative definition weakly typed refers language permit large number implicit type conversion
In JavaScript example expression implicitly convert number conversion succeeds even string letter
Such implicit conversion often useful mask programming error
generally considered orthogonal concept usage literature differs
Some use term mean even confusingly mean simply
Thus called strongly typed weakly statically typed
It may seem odd professional programmer C could weakly statically typed
However notice use generic pointer pointer allow casting pointer pointer without needing explicit cast
This extremely similar somehow casting array byte kind datatype C without using explicit cast
Most programming language associated core sometimes known library especially included part published language standard conventionally made available implementation language
Core library typically include definition commonly used algorithm data structure mechanism input output
The line language core library differs language language
In case language designer may treat library separate entity language
However language core library often treated part language user language specification even require library made available implementation
Indeed language designed meaning certain syntactic construct even described without referring core library
For example string literal defined instance class similarly expression block construct instance library class
Conversely contains multiple coherent subset suffice construct rest language library macro language designer even bother say portion language must implemented language construct must implemented part library
Programming language share property natural language related purpose vehicle communication syntactic form separate semantics showing related language branching one another
But artificial construct also differ fundamental way language evolved usage
A significant difference programming language fully described studied entirety since precise finite definition
By contrast natural language changing meaning given user different community
While also artificial language designed ground specific purpose lack precise complete semantic definition programming language
Many programming language designed scratch altered meet new need combined language
Many eventually fallen disuse
Although attempt design one universal programming language serf purpose failed generally accepted filling role
The need diverse programming language arises diversity context language used One common trend development programming language add ability solve problem using higher level
The earliest programming language tied closely underlying hardware computer
As new programming language developed feature added let programmer express idea remote simple translation underlying hardware instruction
Because programmer le tied complexity computer program computing le effort programmer
This let write functionality per time unit
proposed way eliminate need specialized language programming
However goal remains distant benefit open debate
took position use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless construct dismissed foolish
similarly dismissive idea
Hybrid approach taken
A language designer user must construct number artifact govern enable practice programming
The important artifact language
The specification programming language artifact language use agree upon whether piece valid language behavior shall
A programming language specification take several form including following An programming language provides way write program language execute one configuration hardware software
There broadly two approach programming language implementation
It generally possible implement language using either technique
The output may executed hardware program called interpreter
In implementation make use interpreter approach distinct boundary compiling interpreting
For instance implementation compile execute source line time
Programs executed directly hardware usually run several order magnitude faster interpreted software
One technique improving performance interpreted program
Here execution translates block going used machine code direct execution hardware
Although commonly used programming language fully open specification implementation many programming language exist proprietary programming language implementation available single vendor may claim proprietary language intellectual property
Proprietary programming language commonly internal single product proprietary language used internally within vendor others available external user
Some programming language exist border proprietary open example asserts proprietary right aspect programming language open implementation part system also CLR closed environment
Many proprietary language widely used spite proprietary nature example include
Some language may make transition closed open example originally Ericsson internal programming language
Thousands different programming language created mainly computing field
Software commonly built programming language
Programming language differ form human expression require greater degree precision completeness
When using natural language communicate people human author speaker ambiguous make small error still expect intent understood
However figuratively speaking computer exactly told understand code programmer intended write
The combination language definition program program input must fully specify external behavior occurs program executed within domain control program
On hand idea algorithm communicated human without precision required execution using interleaf natural language code written programming language
A programming language provides structured mechanism defining piece data operation transformation may carried automatically data
A us present language represent concept involved computation
These concept represented collection simplest element available called
process programmer combine primitive compose new program adapt existing one new us changing environment
Programs computer might without human interaction user might type
In case command simply program whose execution chained together
When language run command interpreter without compiling called
It difficult determine programming language widely used usage mean varies context
One language may occupy greater number programmer hour different one line code third may consume CPU time
Some language popular particular kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large scientific engineering application aerospace transportation military embedded application embedded application operating system
Other language regularly used write many different kind application
Various method measuring language popularity subject different bias measured proposed Combining averaging information various internet site claim ten popular programming language descending order overall popularity
There overarching classification scheme programming language
A given programming language usually single ancestor language
Languages commonly arise combining element several predecessor language new idea circulation time
Ideas originate one language diffuse throughout family related language leap suddenly across familial gap appear entirely different family
The task complicated fact language classified along multiple ax
For example Java language encourages organization concurrent language contains construct running multiple parallel

In broad stroke programming language divide classification distinguished
Traditionally programming language regarded describing computation term imperative sentence
issuing command
These generally called language
A great deal research programming language aimed blurring distinction program set instruction program assertion desired answer main feature
More refined paradigm include language hybrid paradigm
An much paradigm direct model underlying machine architecture
By purpose programming language might considered general purpose scripting language language language combination
Some general purpose language designed largely educational goal
A programming language may also classified factor unrelated programming paradigm
For instance programming language use keywords
Other language may classified

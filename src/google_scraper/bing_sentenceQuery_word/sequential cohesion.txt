The literary meaning word cohesion consistency organization different unit
In computer science software engineering cohesion refers level strength unity different component software program
It remained norm software engineering software program developed different function module module separate task associated
Cohesion software determines strength source code comprehended exploring associative principle type calculating method
The concept cohesion introduced capture feature program software engineering domain
This concept make easy determine module software program indicates rapidly perform different task assigned
Increased cohesion software program obtained identical operation performed different module inversely proportional decreased number module
This mean software program designed perform multiple task multiple module higher probability lower cohesion negatively affect overall performance effectiveness computing machine
Associative principle software cohesion refer relationship type software module corresponding action operation
These principle collectively constitute cohesion software program vary according different operational requirement
There seven associative principle formalized seven type software cohesion includes coincidental logical temporal procedural communicational sequential functional cohesion
Each cohesion type unique associative principle associated define action property software module
There certain property associated cohesion software engineering
For instance software constituted three different module similar term action overall cohesion software program increase
Similarly cohesion decrease module entirely different unique action associated
Furthermore cohesion software program also dependent upon type data process inversely proportional increased number data type
Cohesion software program analysis quantitative qualitative method

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I read seminal method statement require executed order passing parameter one next code smell example
Why good idea
A contrived example sequential cohesion Here exert Several kind cohesion normally considered le ideal exists routine contains operation must performed specific order share data step step make complete function done together
An example sequential cohesion routine given birth date calculates employee age time retirement
If routine calculates age us result calculate employee time retirement sequential cohesion
If routine calculates age calculates time retirement completely separate computation happens use data communicational cohesion
How would make routine functionally cohesive
You create separate routine compute employee age given birth date compute time retirement given birth date
The routine could call age routine
They functional cohesion
Other routine could call either routine routine
I think example actually
The input output happened related method could used independently
Other routine could call either routine routine
routine could call computePart method
Here example I think better demonstrates sequential cohesion
Where example coupling stage part inside object ca really use independently
They tightly coupled actually share data step step
I idea author mind
If set method required executed order passing parameter one next two possibility Static typing enforces correct ordering due parameter required return value
Static typing enforce ordering perhaps type recur several place value interchangeable
In view second case pretty bad either enforcement sequence tracking state within object error checking
As far possible I prefer coding error detected
The first case actually almost bad reason
OK ca get sequence wrong without getting error
But leave sequence incomplete
Or call method twice discarding result first call
There lot way creatively thing wrong static check wo detect
Of course OK state checking within class fine
But return data back caller require back call later
Why keep state already tracking
Also alternative
One use single call might mean supplying huge list parameter call another code smell
To avoid perhaps group parameter provide parameter block single call
Rather old parameter block probably prefer class
But data provided class via method call back started lot method one many parameter possibly needing sequence method
In opinion simple example
If look function notice contains function depends input output function
I know confusion regarding concept
I think big part problem choice word
Less ideal necessarily imply bad code
If look Ed Yourdon Larry Constantine original book Structured Design see author attribute subjective scale different level cohesiveness Note scale linear sequential close functional
The author also state highest three suggest simple inexpensive design
As see support claim code example good idea
The cohesion hierarchy useful straining gnat instance
There useful subtle distinction made high end spectrum
However distinction amount smell
When get lower end talk smell even stench worst case
The example contrived
We could modify example slightly instance making age calculation process set interval calculation require reading database table
Therefore functionality point view age calculation cohesive extension retirement calculation depends correct age calculation also functional
There still sequential dependency two calculation age MUST calculated retirement date
Hence one calculation must occur regardless called function
When ordering function call must imposed something must bear responsibility sequencing call
In conclusion
No code smell
Just something might improved little benefit

Conceptual model coupling Coupling low also loose weak high also tight strong
Some type coupling order highest lowest coupling follows A module refers subroutine kind
set one statement name preferably set variable name
In recent work various coupling concept investigated used indicator different modularization principle used practice
Tightly coupled system tend exhibit following developmental characteristic often seen disadvantage Whether loosely tightly coupled system performance often reduced message parameter creation transmission translation
marshaling message interpretation might reference string array data structure require le overhead creating complicated message message
Longer message require CPU memory produce
To optimize runtime performance message length must minimized message meaning must maximized
One approach decreasing coupling seek limit responsibility module along functionality coupling increase two class Low coupling refers relationship one module interacts another module simple stable interface need concerned module internal implementation see
Systems allow object communicate without know anything object implementation
Both system even allow object communicate object written language
Coupling term occur together frequently
Coupling refers interdependency module cohesion describes related function within single module
Low cohesion implies given module performs task related hence create problem module becomes large
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling make value larger coupled module

Location Levels Cohesion This material covered lecture February
As previously mentioned one way ass functional independence module find
You considering kind cohesion listed
It generally important determine level cohesion precisely
It somewhat important decide broader grouping low unacceptable cohesion moderate acceptable ideal cohesion high desirable cohesion
Modules low level cohesion highly undesirable modified replaced
Strategies given separate page
A module one supporting task meaningful relationship one another
give example module necessarily one implemented using software
supporting following task
The legendary one hope programmer told use subroutine told ideal length drew horizontal line every twenty line code put block module doubt creating module coincidental cohesion breaking one two rule along way
If discover best name find module Miscellaneous Functions sign module undesirably low level cohesion
There pretty much excuse inclusion module whose level cohesion low design system implemented using high level programming language
Again quoting A module one whose element contribute activity general category activity activity executed selected outside module
Keeping definition mind consider following example
Someone contemplating journey might compile following list What relates activity
They mean transport course
But crucial point journey person must choose specific subset mode transport
unlikely anyone would use particular journey
A logically cohesive module contains number activity general kind
To use module pick piece need
Thus logically cohesive module grab bag activity
The activity although different forced share one interface module
The meaning parameter depends activity used certain activity parameter even left blank although calling module still need use know specific type
As note later description module name like Do System probably module logically cohesive
Again module whose level cohesion low extremely difficult effectively implement test maintain avoided
A module one supporting task related time
somewhat dated example module supporting task argues activity related fact late night go bed
A module whose name Do All Startup Activities Do All Shutdown Activities might temporal cohesion
On hand higher level cohesion described next
Modules moderate cohesion acceptable ideal
Consider modifying note change might introduce design problem might best leave
A module one supporting different possibly unrelated activity control pass one activity next
give example module whose name might something like Prepare Holiday Meal This bit better temporal cohesion since know fixed linear ordering activity
However still much reason putting activity together one module
A module exhibit activity support use input output data access modify part data structure
give example module supporting activity presumably user specify one set activity occur module called
Another example would module providing interface stack supporting activity Push Pop Empty
test initialization new empty stack possibly operation initialization reading content file perform save writing content file
Note left kind linear ordering containment relationship level cohesion I imagine module would seem procedural cohesion communicational cohesion another module communicational cohesion procedural cohesion
For kind cohesion defined point module kind cohesion defined could argued also kind cohesion defined
Again quoting A module one whose element involved activity output data one activity serf input data next
give example module supporting following activity
presumably car input passed parameter task task
Modules high cohesion extremely desirable need changed except correct kind design problem
A module exhibit functional cohesion support activity needed execution one one task
give several example module name Location

Procedural cohesion say Sequential cohesion say part like assembly line
These definition ambiguous
Please Explain
In Sequential cohesion activity related output current activity input next activity procedural cohesion activity unrelated
Example Sequential Cohesion Let u take example getting data database
Below step task

Get result set sql command prepare result set return result set In example sequence followed activity result input next activity
If activity executed successfully next activity executed
Example Procedure Cohesion Let u take example module
create connection string
Open connection using SqlConnection class
Execute sql command suing SqlCommand
Get resultset using SqlDataReader In example record fetched database
We use SqlConnection SqlCommand SqlDataReader different term functionality
But make complete procedure get record database

I learning computer programming several place I stumbled upon concept cohesion I understand desirable software high cohesion mean
I Java C Python programmer learning book Primer mention cohesion without index could point link topic
I find wikipedia page computer science cohesion informative since say qualitative measure give real code example
High cohesion class well defined job
Low cohesion class lot job much common
Let take example You class add two number class creates window displaying result
This low cohesive class window adding operation much common
The window visual part program adding function logic behind
To create high cohesive solution would create class Window class Sum
The window call Sum method get result display
This way develop separately logic GUI application
An explanation Steve McConnell Cohesion refers closely routine class code routine
Classes contain described strong cohesion heuristic goal make cohesion strong possible
Cohesion useful tool managing complexity code class support central purpose easily brain remember everything code
Some way achieving Uncle Bob Classes
Each method class manipulate one variable
In general class
A class variable used method maximally cohesive
In general neither advisable possible create maximally cohesive class hand would like cohesion high
When cohesion high mean method variable class hang together logical whole
The notion cohesion strongly related notion coupling also principle based heuristic high cohesion named Single Responsibility Principle S SOLID
High cohesion software engineering concept
Basically say class supposed fully
Do overload function supposed whatever directly related appear code class either
Example quite subjective since also consider scale
A simple program modularized fragmented complex program may need level abstraction take care complexity

Email class
It contains data member cc bcc subject body may contain method saveAsDraft send discardDraft
But login since number email protocol implemented separately
Cohesion usually measured using one LCOM Lack cohesion metric original LCOM metric came Chidamber Kemerer
See example A concrete example If class example one private field three method three method use field perform operation class cohesive
Pseudo code cohesive class If class example three private field three method three method use one three field class poorly cohesive
Pseudo code poorly cohesive class The class one thing principle come Robert Martin one principle
The principle prescribes class one reason change
Staying close Single Responsibility Principle could possibly result cohesive code opinion two different thing
This example low cohesion But high cohesion implies function class supposed like named
And function job function
So following example high cohesion cohesion mean class method one defined job
name method class also
example write calculator name class calculator asdfghj
also consider create method task
subtract add etc programmer might use program future know exactly method
good naming reduce commenting effort also principle DRY repeat A general way think principle cohesion locate code along code either depend upon depends
Cohesion applied level composition class level
For instance package namespace ideally contain class relate common theme heavily dependent

keep dependency local
article probably informative Wikipedia case
The term cohesion originally used describe module source code qualitative measure well source code module related
The idea cohesion used variety field
For instance group people military unit may cohesive meaning people unit work together towards common goal
The essence source code cohesion source code module work together towards common well defined goal
The minimum amount source code needed create module output module
The interface well defined input flow interface output flow back interface
There side effect emphasis minimalism
A benefit functionally cohesive module developing automating unit test straightforward
In fact good measure cohesion module easy create full set exhaustive unit test module
A module may class object oriented language function functional language oriented language Much original work area measuring cohesion mostly involved work COBOL program IBM back cohesion definitely object oriented concept
The original intent research concept cohesion associated concept coupling came research characteristic program easy understand maintain extend
The goal able learn best practice programming codify best practice teach practice programmer
The goal good programmer write source code whose cohesion high possible given environment problem solved
This implies large application part source code body vary part level cohesion source code module class
Some time best get temporal sequential cohesion due problem trying solve
The best level cohesion functional cohesion
A module functional cohesion similar mathematical function provide set input get specific output
A truly functional module side effect addition output maintain kind state
It instead well defined interface encapsulates functionality module without exposing internals module person using module provide particular set input get particular output return
A truly functional module thread safe well
Many programming language library contain number example functional module whether class template function
The functional cohesive example would mathematical function sin cosine square root etc
Other function may side effect maintain state kind resulting making use function complicated
For instance function throw exception set global error variable C must used sequence function example Standard C library maintains internal state provides pointer must managed issue log log utility example function longer functional cohesion
I read Yourdon Constantine original book Structured Programming I first came across idea cohesion Meilir book Practical Guide Structured Systems Design much better job describing coupling cohesion
The Yourdon Constantine book seems bit academic
Steve McConnell book Code Complete quite good practical revised edition quite bit say good programming practice

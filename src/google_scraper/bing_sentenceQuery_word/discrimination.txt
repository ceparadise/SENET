Now senior Fort Worth Texas swept prestigious national competition scored tackling ovarian cancer
She discovered protein keep cell growing resistant chemotherapy drug cisplatin
Among five finalist age group female
Consider number In percent college freshman men planned major science engineering compared percent woman according National Science Foundation report
Some area science attract woman men biology social behavioral science
But computer science physic engineering overwhelmingly male
Nowhere disparity pronounced engineering computer science close behind
More twice many men woman attend graduate school computer science field four time many men enrolled engineering according report
It noted America whole outpaced competitor year come science math education
In math science exam given student world student placed math science compared country
It bad news engineering
While master degree awarded woman hovered percent slight dip level bachelor degree among woman climbed percent engineering doctorate percent awarded woman time past according professor civil environmental engineering University Colorado Boulder
The percentage woman class dismal said
Of student take freshman civil engineering class generally woman
In civil engineering really pathetic said
In environmental engineering closer percent
Right bat woman look around lot woman look like
Bielefeldt hunt explain fix yawning gender gap
Inherent difference gender explain say
Every year student write personal essay engineering mean pay close attention female student say
Some say find scarcity woman isolating others cite subtle discrimination
Frequently see woman relegated traditional role I build robot secretary group said
Unless assertive men take group
And female engineering major grade well men tendency underrate technical ability said
Women tend leave engineering higher grade point average men perceive technical skill sometimes different
And different reality
Bielefeldt landed engineering almost accident
She painfully shy high school student need summer job said shy walk mall
But engineering research program Iowa State University required simply filling application read talking required
So pounced
She spent summer researching water quality treating water sample chemistry lab stayed lab high school college
She loved hard science microbiology chemistry also bigger picture
You connected land think ramification pesticide use fertilizer use said
The broader environmental human health effect pretty compelling
That big picture aspect important many woman discovered
I often see female student say want engineering help people positive impact society environment
Women also lag behind computer science
Only percent software developer woman according Bureau Labor Statistics
And mean woman may missing incredible job opportunity said Maria Klawe president Harvey Mudd College
It going work place like Google Microsoft Facebook told NewsHour interview Judy Woodruff post tomorrow
It computer science medicine computer science art computer science language educational software
career pay really well flexible great opportunity combine career family
Plus add losing female perspective translates technology seeing market
If cut essentially half population going lot creative idea never make way technology people involved
look yet another area woman lagging patent
Only percent commercial woman according paper
And gap ca attributed fewer woman field
Even within field female engineer le likely male work development design patent originate according Rutgers paper lead author
And serious economic consequence Eliminating patenting shortfall would increase GDP per caput paper say
Retention another important part puzzle
Hunt also studied woman exit science engineering field
In field science found exit rate female engineer much higher scientific field
And male field woman likely leave data show
She also found reason leaving often linked pay promotion
Women engineering field harder time advancing compared field said
A lack female mentor subtle discrimination work condition men talk way woman found disrespectful also common factor
That sort thing offputting harder measure Hunt said
Madline Heilman psychology professor New York University expert gender stereotype think problem deeply rooted many realize
Women Heilman said seen communal caring emotional concerned others men intellectual rational logical
If ask someone describe man woman get remarkably similar response got year ago said
That residual role men woman played woman caretaker men worker
Those perception held reason stake maintaining role world
She take step farther
When woman excel job generally celebrated
In fact woman may penalized ambitious confident assertive
How fit science
The requirement well certain scientific field fit attribute woman considered Heilman said
And get ostracized sidelined seen unlikeable make unpleasant stay
At CU Boulder Bielefeldt colleague developed marketing campaign designed draw woman engineering field
They emphasize engineering creativity positive impact society teamwork
The university also outreach program sends college engineering student mentor younger student afterschool program
The farther better Bielefeldt said
If find interesting exciting early would tracked appropriate math science course
Just yesterday The White House Council Women Girls held Eisenhower Executive Office Building encourage girl get involved science engineering technology math
There made NBA NFL cheerleader science math background tackling issue high kick pair pom pom
They slated perform cheer Washington DC weekend
Here look appearance festival last year And NewsHour also growing Make Movement movement designed get kid hacking tweaking building cool thing garage backyard basement
A note warning Klawe though starting high school leaf four long year student get science
Her strategy capture attention soon enter college
You get intro computer science course absolutely fascinating fun creative said
And much fun ca believe really computer science
They done Harvey Mudd computer course designed woman mind
We kind student arrive saying I hate computer
But take computer science course first semester
And halfway semester I asking What think favorite course
And probably say
I hate computer I hate computing oh God greatest course ever
Stanford University University California Berkeley also make appealing woman
Still Bielefeldt said year trying different thing still struggle draw woman science
The important thing note long Bielefeldt said
The fact made tangible forward progress despite working long time puzzling depressing sure secret

One key area study determine whether gender bias discrimination woman exists Stanford Computer Science department
While hotly contested issue shortage woman computer science faculty spawned claim bias exists little solid evidence back claim
Although went study unsure expect hoped determine least whether people closest issue perceived gender bias
While specific statistic possible discrepancy funding salary office space respect afforded woman faculty compared men unavailable felt direct interview female many male computer science faculty would provide sufficient insight situation woman
never subject even noticed sort A Stanford Female PhD Student These word reflected general opinion many computer science faculty student interviewed male female
Although woman certainly minority CS faculty one interviewed attribute bias discrimination
As stated one female faculty member think people trying keep woman Computer Science faculty position
I think want go However statement greatly differ result produced Both MIT Stanford similarly low ratio female CS faculty yet interview conducted study MIT female faculty member nearly unanimously spoke blatant example wanton discrimination
Tenured woman faculty said department excluded significant role
Often accompanied claimed unfair difference salary space award resource men woman faculty despite woman made professional accomplishment equal male colleague
Most senior woman faculty study said felt excluded position power making job difficult le satisfying
In contrast junior woman faculty felt included supported department concerned difficulty combining family work
This interesting difference make appear though woman le accepted CS community get academia
In study found claim bias Stanford far common undergraduate feeling uncomfortable male dominated class graduate student entirely faculty level
It noted MIT study published many expert questioned validity criticized legitimacy
went far claim elementary standard scientific evidence fails prove gender discrimination Although unsure true state woman faculty MIT interview yielded sharply different result study
For one thing one claimed administration way practicing unfair treatment woman
As one female lecturer stated CS department gender issue
Women get opportunity anyone else
like people take seriously give chance One female professor asked whether exists discrimination woman faculty CS Stanford likewise stated department perfectly fair equitable whole completely supportive
individual may biased affect This seemed suggest woman worked excelled Computer Science male dominated field long learned accept even shrug male biased view
fact one excel found way deal
never heard complain
Even grad school woman know deal sexism stated male professor
While neither completely denies existence sexism likewise feel like way affected desire become faculty member
When faced question whether bias discrimination could possible cause current shortage female Computer Science faculty vast majority interviewee including every faculty member interviewed well almost every graduate student claimed
male faculty male applicant pool stated female professor involved hiring new faculty member
love see female faculty member qualified
going sacrifice quality department hire She recently interviewed woman faculty position ultimately offer job
qualified
We even consider fact One female graduate student claimed fault department unfairly excluding woman rather shortage woman attributable woman confident aggressive pursuing She felt people went far academia people went way get noticed
woman feel intimidated male faculty even men biased discriminatory
Quite contrary notion woman unfairly excluded interview even suggested woman advantage men
However view far common male student female
One male master student stated Stanford assuming equal competence probably asset female
Professors inclined seek many
If one came along probably get snapped Another male master student similar thought seems woman given bit leeway He felt men likely brushed aside excel study since male Computer Science student common
easier female everyone supportive helping woman achieve foal field whereas men In mind woman receive extra opportunity since department would want
However special treatment also negative effect
When asked whether professor would seek female research one female PhD student said varies professor
sure Stanford
At Brown professor tried attract female sometimes aggressively sacrificing She felt could create atmosphere resentment among female male peer turn could lead bias
However professor agreed special treatment like occur Stanford
As one female professor stated doubt anyone really chooses one gender
The difference individual far outweigh difference She went admit especially would see preferential treatment towards female faculty member age
Especially one work EE department
They expect male graduate Still though feel like woman excluded equal opportunity
While none faculty member felt discrimination woman Stanford present one professor discussed discriminated industry
Male businessmen show great deal resorted pretend secretary business transaction run smoothly
However feel environment different Stanford academic environment general
Even woman class eighty student fell discriminated mind situation
Not every student feel way though
While fact woman currently Computer Science imply explicit bias woman many female student felt subtle bias minority
time I enter CS room always looking around woman yet encounter woman field stated one female undergrad
She feel shortage creates uncomfortable environment
Another student agreed simply talk female faculty member female Through interview none woman men felt discrimination exists Computer Science Stanford
One woman soon receiving PhD made following comment time Stanford felt warm welcome working advisor
excellent experience working professor respectful treated differently guy working
After receiving overwhelming response discrimination Stanford report like one MIT still continue produced still claim bias exist
treat bigger issue really one professor stated
woman interested Computer Science without event
If man chooses CS normal
If woman chooses CS get Another professor feel way blow thing proportion hold huge convention discussing state woman She felt constant barrage report study small percentage woman CS alarmist effect making people think shortage must problem really problem
There time female humanity professor either

In recent year issue race prejudice dominated news report police brutality struggle civil right demand equality
Yet demand equality come different group different reason often undertaken protest practice racial discrimination
In simple term practice treating someone differently poorly color skin
For example interviewing two equally qualified applicant job one black white decided hire white person prefer work white people would engaged racial discrimination
This example might sound unfair illegal generally occurs lot might think
In case people intentionally mean discriminate unconscious reaction whereas time people intentionally discriminate
Regardless whether conscious unconscious best way combat unfair practice know racial discrimination look like understand work
Race racism far complex adequately explain single lesson important thing know call variation skin color concrete thing concept
In technical term one many idea theory people create give certain situation meaning
In case color person skin mean absolutely nothing social cultural context people created concept race explain one person different color another
The reason important understand social construct race foundation racial discrimination
For instance white Europeans arrived United States often justified taking land Native people promoting idea Indians white inferior deserving land white people
In fact many example American history race used justify poor treatment people one demonstrate complex erroneous nature racial discrimination
Less decade establishment first British colony Jamestown VA white Europeans brought African slave Southern colony tend crop
This began long period Africans brought United States forced work money
In case slavery black men woman child thought property people based belief race made inferior white people suited perform manual labor
In simplest term slave treated le human darker skin color

The American Civil War put end practice slavery United States end racial discrimination
Beginning around last decade century many state South enacted referred
Although amendment constitution stated people treated equally Jim Crow Laws allowed equal treatment
This mean public place like restaurant movie theater white black people could separated long receiving service
These law eventually overturned two race le legally integrated
The treatment World War II another important example racial discrimination
Following attack Pearl Harbor many Americans feared invasion Japanese became suspicious believing presence posed risk public safety
In response public fear US government forced held large facility many held year
The internment particularly troubling take place long ago involved huge number Americans imprisoned reason race people attacked Pearl Harbor
Slavery Jim Crow law internment camp example overt intentional act discrimination America past racial discrimination continues problem present
example law enforcement problem wherein officer may suspect person criminal activity particular race ethnicity
Other example racial discrimination much le obvious harder prove
For example since law place protect people discriminated race mean happen
There several court case fought recent past people refused thing like job apartment based color skin
act treating someone differently others color skin
This generally happens attachment certain meaning person race used justify discrimination
In century south example established keep separate white
In recent history racial discrimination seen imprisonment whereby suspicion criminal activity based race ethnicity

Previously I used following three tool quick assembly Olympia oyster PacBio data I posting quick overview make easier follow actually done without read three different notebook entry corresponding Jupyter notebook
When I say quick assembly I mean
The entire assembly process probably take hour computer I used seems fast
Here quick dirty done This us set default code analyzing PacBio data
Minimap accepts two FASTQ file need map FASTQ file
So multiple FASTQ sequencing file concatenate single file prior running minimap
This us concatenated FASTQ file PAF file output miniasm step
The code taken example provided miniasm documentation option available
The FASTA file needed minimap Step
Using default setting map FASTQ read back contigs PAF file created fist step
These mapping required Racon assembly Step
The output file FASTA file listed
In Steven suggested I try pipeline assembling Olympia oyster PacBio data
I followed pipeline described paper
This notebook entry contains initial minimap execution
Followed
Jupyter Notebook GitHub

In civilization minimap display rectangle even though civ actually played cylinder mean east west edge minimap touching
Sometimes minimap display calendar line uncomfortable position example I would like empire middle appears close edge minimap
I know exiting loading game minimap changed empire different better position far side
Is way somehow control
Unfortunately I believe possible
The fact minimap change reload probably way map handled start map centered revealed position map becomes revealed eventually actual edge map become visible
I betting Civ V keep track map started reload recenters map based revealed area starting position invariably result center game map center minimap greater whole world becomes explored By posting answer agree

I want get overview code would like use minimap VS Code
I find option set menu
I using VS Code
Feb vscode support minimaps
You switch function via preference
Just follow step On right pane see custom setting
There add following setting If first setting need surround curly bracket remove tailing comme
If already one please keep mind JSON need separate key value comma
Adding following also highlight map Additionally render block instead character better visualization Minimap You update version add user workspace setting opened

Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun
Not mention lucrative career opportunity
Computer Science The Profession Computer science discipline involves understanding design computer computational process
In general form concerned understanding information transfer transformation
Particular interest placed making process efficient endowing form intelligence
The discipline range theoretical study algorithm practical problem implementation term computational hardware software
A central focus process handling manipulating information
Thus discipline span advancing fundamental understanding algorithm information process general well practical design efficient reliable software hardware meet given specification
Computer science young discipline evolving rapidly beginning
As includes theoretical study experimental method engineering design one discipline
This differs radically physical science separate understanding advancement science application science field engineering design implementation
In computer science inherent intermingling theoretical concept computability algorithmic efficiency modern practical advancement electronics continue stimulate advance discipline
It close interaction theoretical design aspect field bind together single discipline
Because rapid evolution difficult provide complete list computer science area
Yet clear crucial area theory algorithm data structure programming methodology language computer element architecture
Other area include software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation
A professional computer scientist must firm foundation crucial area field likely knowledge one area discipline depending upon person particular area practice
Thus well educated computer scientist able apply fundamental concept technique computation algorithm computer design specific design problem
The work includes detailing specification analysis problem provides design function desired satisfactory performance reliable maintainable meet desired cost criterion
Clearly computer scientist must sufficient training computer science area able accomplish task must also firm understanding area mathematics science well broad education liberal study provide basis understanding societal implication work performed
Computer Science study principle application technology computing computer
It involves study data data structure algorithm process structure principle computer hardware software design methodology topic numerical analysis operation research artificial intelligence language design structure translation technique
Computer Science provides foundation knowledge student career objective wide range computing profession
The study efficient effective software development technique
Team work communication skill
An interest applying technology problem wide variety discipline
Computer Science concerned information much sense physic concerned energy devoted representation storage manipulation presentation information
Computer Science concerned study machine communication man machine application machine

It rectangular see game straight
You see bit horizon
At bottom view frame see much top view frame away
If carved frame held angle floor realize area floor see frame rectangular either
Is one familiar
In Computer Graphics field view often constrained called viewing frustum usually via Culling
The practical consideration rendering infinite scene even modern hardware restrictive enough almost every major rendering library performs form culling even ray tracing usually cull different manner
Culling process object scene get drawn
In common method rendering drawing fragment culling bounded near clipping plan far clipping plan viewing angle
Because viewing angle usually defined axis axese resulting shape Frustum
This commonly known Viewing Frustum even set directly instead stipulating clipping plane Field View
In openGL glfrustum call glu calculate frustum via gluPerspective call take plan field view Y ratio FoVx FoVy
Since viewing frustum represents player actually see maker felt would beneficial projected onto minimap player could identify within visible range
Additionally identified culling result viewing frustum culling result terrain
This representation viewing frustum minimap change move around
game
Under I mean see map angle
As result see MORE object top result see bigger peace map top side monitor

That mean terrain building unit displayed without taking account far away height flying bird
The display part area see right see object far away frame minimap trapezoid rectangle

I like add minimap feature app developed based QGIS
I know overview feature however quite different minimap
The minimap show basic feature canvas window map item
It like Overview show layer add
What looking minimap plugin overview provide
In addition brilliant suggestion Jakob plugin open new window showing basic map feature layer layer main window etc Similarly plugin also allows multiple window loaded
Hope help
There plugin called MirrorMap give extra map control layer shown

I following Visual Studio Code This take much room I still want use Minimap I editing single file single window
Is way Minimap enabled single file disabled Windowed mode
There way VS Code
Currently setting true false either always enables minimap always disables
Unfortunately shown also toggleMinimap command assign keybindings
You might find useful though used create toggle minimap command setting By posting answer agree

I unable understand characteristic path length CPL graph
In one definition written defined median mean shortest path length connecting vertex vertex
This I understand
Is right
Suppose node A B A reach B C different path
We consider two path AB AC
These two shortest path length A reach B C respectively
We take mean AB AC
Similarly calculate two mean B C like I calculated A
In end take median mean
Am I right
To get CPL definition first take average distance certain vertex vertex v w v w G After every vertex v V G calculate previously calculated
Let x distance vertex x V G connected graph The characteristic path length defined x V G x n v V G u V G x n n number vertex G sum range among pair vertex In graph theoretical term characteristic path length G dividied n By posting answer agree

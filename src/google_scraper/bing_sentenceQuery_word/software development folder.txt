Can anybody help locking folder Windows XP
By locking I mean If user try open particular folder file locked given error stating access granted
Also hiding file Windows XP
To hide folder simpily right click folder select property click check box called hidden
Your file hidden
Locking folder I believe requires third party software
I messed around one think name
Another way lock stuff people access compress folder using winzip winrar
You option password protect compressed file
hmn XP try double clicking computer right click folder file choose sharing security Then first frame Local sharing security make folder private reason however min eis greyed I researching
Thanks help
But still problem I ca Zip file everytime I wa lock
For hiding also I seen program like HideFoldersXP
They provide actual functionality folder hiding
Any comment help welcome
use hidefoldersxp
Thanks Q
Actually I forgot mention I write code purpose
I used Hide Folders XP given lot time figure done locking hiding
But get hint
Hi If want make folder inaccessible unbrowsable one NTFS file system right click choose property security tab select account account owner folder object click Deny checkbox full control account
All deny check box get checked automatically
Then click Now body even browse folder administrator take ownership folder access emergency even delete account want Loren Soth Hi If want make folder inaccessible unbrowsable one NTFS file system right click choose property security tab select account account owner folder object click Deny checkbox full control account

Then click Now body even browse folder administrator take ownership folder access emergency even delete account want Loren Soth agree loren file system specific computer NOT NTFS instead whats method case Hi Unless use party software proven resistent implementation cryptographic attack one implement AES RSA alike something proprietary ca real data security file system
Even NTFS security setting I described take boot CD USB Linux BartPE boot cd access NTFS protected file
Only native efficent solution actually Encrypted file system available NTFS make impossible access secured data absence matching user identitiy original OS hardware
Loren Soth want work home send one blank mail want work home send blank mail want work home send blank mail go find another forum spam
like P Not even little
If I Admin privs forum I squash
Quoted muhanena want work home send blank mail Kick person
To lock folder belonging NTFS partition use command
It used change permission reading writing allow deny full access
But ca used FAT partition
Please help anybody know FAT partition
Hi Although still military grade data protection might use Paragon Partition Manager set partition hidden make inaccessible OS access Part
Manager application
For sure bet employ party fly AES RSA encryptors
When considering data integrity think always data HDD captured foreign PC foreign OS Linux
And consider presence key logger root kit memory intruder malware working legitimately

learn share knowledge build career
I experimenting directory structure currently using one Webs store web application desktop store desktop application
The dev directory version controlled directory prod qe uat store respective current release
The project directory store related project item
What software development directory structure reason recommend structure
I following For reason help lot keep file grouped project keep inactive project one I currently working folder
I guess I get distracted otherwise
I big fan granular leaf top level I perform much better filesystem organized project
I much likely code directory think Hey spec
spec directory think Which project I want spec
To rearrange diagram That said organization office follows method seems support largish development environment
Personally I find really frustrating search mockups case directory one project specifically analyst spec separate Marketing model I digress standpoint separating concept probably make good deal sense
Just two cent
I store everything c directory window machine linux solaris environment
Below I learning code experiment snippet one directory project
After time project defunct I erase local storage code archived SVN
Source code multiple project module test r us code src folder module test b r us code src folder Main project file production us code src folder Documents tool us code src folder tool b us code src folder utility cleaning temporary build file
Project test tool visual studio Symbian makefile Makefile linux makefile

Difference test application tool application tool display something le useful test check whether work
Difference test main application test application contain whole functionality also test application might enable special define needed testing
Normally testing application reduced set main application without extra define
I usually use directory structure I tend group project three main directory Then inside folder I Also project maintained git repository doap file describing along usual stuff like README INSTALL NEWS AUTHORS LICENSE usually doc dir srcs dir optionally libs dir build file
If project connected doap file say something I create folder root project place related project
The exception two paragraph project atic written Delphi
Also source stored since I quickly create binary

If reminds something know I inspired apache software foundation organize project I lab research atic incubator doap file etc
Because I mostly java man day apache came mind
I tend prefer flatter directory structure would like recommend keeping simple possible
Remember least Windowsland limit command line length
Thus deep structure might spawn nasty build error
I use shorthanded name project toss relevant file directory one directory

So help u particularly technologically inclined written article explaining Key Computer Science Concepts easy understandable term
Read Carl fantastic article find need know algorithm data structure AI computer architecture concurrency computer security cryptography software development methodology
To make learning fun interesting list important computer science theory concept explained analogy minimal technical term
It like computer science degree program everyone get understand general concept
Important note Also check getting started programming
Say order download film collection online time
You want test method faster
The delivery take almost day arrive download completed minute earlier
Great
So tight race
What I order several movie like The Lord Rings Twilight The Dark Knight Trilogy etc
download movie online time
This time delivery still take day complete online download take day finish
For online shopping number purchased item input affect delivery time
The output constant

It important understand big O notation help analyze algorithm
Big O notation represents algorithm
Let assume O O n scenario example
Someone movie theater asks row sitting
You lazy count ask person front
You simply add person answer get current row number
Brilliant right
However person front exactly thing
Finally question reach row answer I row
From correct message incremented one row pas way person asked
Here another example known
A nurse carrying tray box cocoa cup containing smaller image holding thing turn contains even smaller version image
Here
If still get recursion Otherwise continue reading
Let assume leak water pipe garden
You take bucket sealing material fix problem
After see leak much bigger need plumber bring bigger tool
In meanwhile still using bucket drain water
After notice massive underground stream opened
You need handle gallon water every second
Buckets useful anymore
You need completely new approach solve problem volume velocity water grown
To prevent town flooding may need government build massive dam requires enormous civil engineering expertise elaborate control system
Big data describes data set large complex impossible manage conventional data processing tool
Every computer scientist programmer least know Imagine going hiking goal reach highest peak possible
You already map start thousand possible path shown map
You lazy simply time evaluate
Screw map
You started hiking simple strategy greedy
Just take path
After trip ended whole body sore tired look hiking map first time
Oh god
There muddy river I crossed instead keep walking upwards
A greedy algorithm pick never reconsiders choice
This time climbing another hill
You determined find path lead highest peak
However map provided foggy
To make trip easier downloaded hiking app track path taken measure current altitude
You climb hill
Each time take exact path lead highest peak ever recorded somewhere choose
You also randomly choose different starting point known
So linger around area reduce probability getting stuck
The hill climbing algorithm attempt find better solution generating
Each neighboring solution generated based best solution far
It Mount Everest biggest challenge ever faced
Your goal reach summit impractical climb Mount Everest
You one chance
You cautious
Instead always climbing upwards reducing chance taking wrong path
The higher climb lower probability move lower point explore
What equal
Eight
What
Nine
Wow calculate fast
You added one
So need recount remembered eight
Brilliant
The example describes yes memoization memorization approach dynamic programming store result previous computation future use
Pararth Shah wrote brilliant analogy long included
P v NP one popular important unsolved problem computer science field
Say I give multiplication question like x The answer
Easy solve right
What I reverse question x To solve assuming seen probably go possible number
We find easily
What I ask Could possibly
You answer right
Just divide
Multiplication easy
Finding original factor number hard
So P polynomial problem
Computer easily multiply super large number without spending significantly computer time small number
NP nondeterministic polynomial problem
Finding factor still fairly easy computer solve number
It impossible computer right
Here important part Are NP problem factorization also P problem multiplication discover efficient way solve NP problem
Are NP problem really hard solve need aha moment brilliant scientist
come efficient algorithm
Or maybe human dumb
Imagine exist machine life posse
They see u like see ant
Our level intelligence insignificant
Solving P v NP problem like solving
So P v NP problem important
If able prove mean solved easily within reasonable computer time
We able cure cancer break password etc
It
P v NP listed Clay Mathematics Institute
million awarded first correct solution
Computers work adding complexity top complexity
When drive car necessarily understand car engine work
The complex detail hidden
So computer turn binary code program
Here excellent video us domino visualize computer perform binary calculation basic fundamental level huge topic includes subfields like
Let say work secretary company A
You answer phone call arrange meeting typing document etc
You always task based priority
Every time phone ring stop whatever task working
Concurrency property program system allow task run time period
Eventually cope job much data entry task
You complain bos happily hire data entry clerk handle data entry task
Parallelism allows task run time provided machine capability
However implementation concurrency concept also introduces potential problem race condition
This happen allow concurrent transaction banking system race condition handled So handle situation
One really simple way mutual exclusion
Now whenever ongoing transaction system lock account involved transaction
This time moment transaction A occurs account locked
You withdraw money ATM
It unlocks transaction A completes
So mutual exclusion solves problem right
Yes nobody want get rejected ATM every time ongoing transaction
Let modify solution little bit
Now let set different priority level different type transaction
Say cash withdrawal request higher priority bank transfer
When withdraw money ATM transaction A bank transfer stop allow transaction B carry first higher priority
It resume transaction B completed
Binary semaphore simple
ongoing transaction
waiting
On hand counting semaphore allows process running time
Let say locker room manager spa
There locker
You keep track number key time receive hand key exactly know
If locker full others queue
Whenever someone done hand key first person queue
Deadlock another common issue concurrency system
Let use banking system analogy different scenario
Just keep mind access bank account locked whenever ongoing transaction
However since transaction completed access locked account
Both wait complete
Deadlock
Here real life example Let approach first
Let approach first
Hacking similar breaking house
Here popular hacking technique Try hundred thousand different key
An experienced burglar try commonly used key first
A attack usually start guessing commonly used password like abcdef etc
A couple moved next door
They really nice helpful
They often invite dinner
One day mentioned going vacation soon
They happily offered take care dog
You left spare key
Since heard news
Social engineering revealing private information
A burglar check every possible entry find easiest way weakness get
Maybe window left open know
A burglar pretend plumber unlock door
He fix leaking pipe everything look perfectly normal
After left discovered jewelry missing
A trojan horse malware program useful helpful run malicious code
Your door lock jammed call locksmith
He fix door lock secretly duplicate another key
A rootkit gain computer various way like social engineering disguise necessary file hard detect antivirus software
Here bookshop analogy
Imagine people visit little bookshop time
Your bookshop occupied others come
You ask leave seem coming group
They probably know
Most seem genuinely interested buy book
Some even ask book shelved
Someone counter pay penny
People keep coming hour
All look perfectly normal
At end day made one book sale
Remember guy pay penny
DDoS attempt bring site service visitor
Cryptography study application secure communication
Here widely used cryptographic protocol Say Alice Bob want send stuff
To make sure nobody see stuff lock box
They make identical symmetric key lock meet share key beforehand
Sharing identical key work fine among people
What Alice want exchange stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff
Alice use lock key shared Bob else Bob unlock box easily
Of course Alice share completely new different lock key Carl Alice want exchange stuff different people
She need keep manage different key
So Alice come brilliant solution
Now maintains key private key
She distribute padlock public key friend
Anyone close padlock encrypt key open decrypt
Now anyone send stuff Alice using padlock distributed Alice longer manage different key different people
If Alice want send something Carl ask Carl padlock public key use lock encrypt stuff send Carl
The basic principle everyone private key decrypt message provide sender public key message encryption
You figure need document requirement
Like waterfall way go back unless start
You move next phase current phase completed
You figure thing need beginning
Then continuously improve evolve collaborate adapt development go
Here popular implementation agile development methodology So graduated
You write good beautiful code hopefully everything perfect far
Let introduce software development methodology taught college
Next wonder suck estimating development time And methodology often implemented wrongly So go
Computer science nutshell
Feel free suggest new computer science theory concept add think important often confusing
Computer scientist like physicist programmer like engineer
Writing specific instruction dumb yet obedient machine
What mean
Imagine teach kid shower
The kid know follow instruction
So ask kid Oh wait The kid even remove clothes entering shower
That computer work
You tell computer exactly need
It know assume never think consequence
Getting zone like falling asleep
Imagine waking person close falling asleep second
Now spend time fall back sleep

Objects noun method verb
Objects like people
They living breathing thing knowledge inside thing memory inside remember thing
And rather interacting interact high level abstraction like right
Here example If I laundry object give dirty clothes send message say Can get clothes laundered I happen know best laundry place San Francisco
And I speak English I dollar pocket
So I go hail taxicab tell driver take place San Francisco
I go get clothes laundered I jump back cab I get back
I give clean clothes say Here clean You idea I
You knowledge laundry place
Maybe speak French even hail taxi
You pay one dollar pocket
Yet I knew
And know
All complexity hidden inside able interact high level abstraction

In collection used often
These may include configuration data documentation help data message template specification
In referred
A also collection implementation behavior written term language interface behavior invoked
For instance people want write higher level program use library make instead implementing system call
In addition behavior provided reuse multiple independent program
A program invokes behavior via mechanism language
For example simple C behavior library invoked using C normal
What distinguishes call library function versus another function program way code organized system
Library code organized way used multiple program connection code part program organized used within one program
This distinction gain hierarchical notion program grows large program
In case may internal library reused independent large program
The distinguishing feature library organized purpose reused independent program user need know interface internal detail library
The value library lie reuse behavior
When program invokes library gain behavior implemented inside library without implement behavior
Libraries encourage sharing code fashion ease distribution code
The behavior implemented library connected invoking program different
If code library accessed build invoking program library called
An alternative build executable invoking program distribute independently library implementation
The library behavior connected executable invoked executed either part process starting execution middle execution
In case library called loaded
A dynamic library loaded linked preparing program execution
Alternatively middle execution application may explicitly request module
Most although programmer also create custom library
Most modern provide library implement majority system service
Such library service modern application requires
As code used modern application provided system library
The earliest programming concept analogous library intended separate definition program
brought COMPOOL Communication Pool concept popular attention although adopted idea software
Following computer science principle Comm Pool purpose permit sharing System Data among many program providing centralized data description
also included primitive capability library system described inadequate library facility retrospect
Another major contributor modern library concept came form innovation
FORTRAN subprogram compiled independently compiler lacked
So prior introduction module FORTRAN subprogram impossible
Finally historian concept remember influential
Simula first language nearly identical modern concept used
The concept Simula also progenitor
Even developed originally Simula class could included library file added compile time
Libraries important program process resolve reference known library module
The linking process usually automatically done program search set library module given order
Usually considered error link target found multiple time given set library
Linking may done executable file created whenever program used
The reference resolved may address jump routine call
They may main program one module depending upon another
They resolved fixed relocatable address common base allocating runtime memory module referenced
Some programming language may use feature called whereby linker aware integrated compiler linker know external reference used code library never actually even though internally referenced discarded compiled application
For example program us integer arithmetic arithmetic operation exclude library routine
This feature lead smaller application file size reduced memory usage
Some reference program library module stored relative symbolic form resolved code library assigned final static address
process adjusting reference done either linker
In general relocation done individual library address memory may vary depending program using library combined
avoids reference absolute address therefore require relocation
When linking performed creation executable another object file known
In case linking usually done may also done
A also known one intended statically linked
Originally static library existed
Static linking must performed module recompiled
All module required program sometimes statically linked copied executable file
This process resulting file known program
A static build may need used desired
A file intended shared shared object file
Modules used program loaded individual shared object memory rather copied linker creates single monolithic executable file program
Shared library statically linked meaning reference library module resolved module allocated memory executable file created
But often linking shared library postponed loaded
Most modern shared library file format executable file
This offer two main advantage first requires making one loader rather two single loader considered well worth added complexity
Secondly allows executables also used shared library
Typical combined executable shared library format Unix Windows
In older environment stack based data local allowed shared library code significant restriction placed shared library code
Library code may shared memory multiple well disk
If virtual memory used process would execute physical page RAM mapped different address space process
This advantage
For instance system application often hundred kilobyte size loaded quickly majority code located library already loaded purpose operating system
Programs accomplish RAM sharing using lead complex flexible architecture using common virtual address Windows
These system make sure various trick like address space reserving slot shared library code great probability shared
A third alternative used successor
This allows code place significant restriction code placed shared
In case different version shared library cause problem especially library different version file name different application installed system require specific version
Such scenario known named Windows
Most modern operating system method eliminate situation use application specific private library
Dynamic linking linking performed program loaded executed rather executable file created
A dynamically linked library DLL dynamic shared object DSO system library intended dynamic linking
Only minimum amount work done executable file created record library routine program need index name number routine library
The majority work linking done time application loaded load time execution run time
Usually necessary linking program called dynamic linker linking loader actually part underlying
However possible exceedingly difficult write program us dynamic linking includes dynamic linker even operating system provides support dynamic linking
Programmers originally developed dynamic linking operating system starting MTS built late
Since shared library system change often system compute likely load address shared library system needed store information library executables
If every shared library loaded undergone process load predetermined address speed process dynamic linking
This optimization known macOS Linux
Disadvantages technique include time required precompute address every time shared library change inability use requirement sufficient virtual address space use problem alleviated adoption architecture least time
Loaders shared library vary widely functionality
Some depend executable storing explicit path library
Any change library naming layout file system cause system fail
More commonly name library path stored executable operating system supplying method find library based algorithm
If shared library executable depends deleted moved renamed incompatible version library copied place earlier search executable would fail load
This called existing many platform
The infamous Windows variant commonly known
This problem occur version library uniquely identified program reference library full unique identifier
The DLL hell problem earlier Windows version arose using name library guaranteed unique resolve dynamic link program
To avoid DLL hell later version Windows rely largely option program install private partial retreat use shared mechanism prevent replacement shared system DLLs earlier version
check determine proper place load DLLs implement DLLs check directory defined order
First Windows check directory loaded program directory set calling function System Windows directory current working directory finally directory specified PATH
Applications written framework since also check primary store shared dll file remove issue
used flexible system collecting list library number known location similar PATH concept system first start
Moving library around cause problem although user incur time cost first starting system
Most system search path specifying file system look dynamic library
Some system specify default path others dynamic loader
Some format specify additional directory search library particular program
This usually overridden although disabled setgid program user ca force program run arbitrary code root permission
Developers library encouraged place dynamic library place default search path
On downside make installation new library problematic known location quickly become home increasing number library file making management complex
Dynamic loading subset dynamic linking involves dynamically linked library loading unloading request
Such request may made implicitly explicitly run time
Implicit request made compile time linker add library reference include file path simply file name
Explicit request made application make direct call operating system API run time
Most operating system support dynamically linked library also support dynamically loading library via linker
For instance us API function based system including UNIX system use
Some development system automate process
Although originally pioneered dynamic linking reach used consumer late
It generally available form operating system early
During period OOP becoming significant part programming landscape
OOP runtime binding requires additional information traditional library supply
In addition name entry point code located within also require list object depend
This one OOP main advantage inheritance mean part complete definition method may different place
This simply listing one library requires service another true OOP system library may known vary system system
At time many developer worked idea program display running desktop computer would use service data storage processing
For instance program computer would send message minicomputer return small sample huge dataset display
RPC already handled task standard RPC system
Soon majority minicomputer mainframe vendor instigated project combine two producing OOP library format could used anywhere
Such system known supported remote access
Microsoft COM example system local use DCOM modified version support remote access
For time object library held status next big thing programming world
There number effort create system would run across platform company competed try get developer locked system
Examples include DOE PDO Microsoft number system
After inevitable cooling marketing hype object library continue used programming distributed information system
rough OOP equivalent older type code library
They contain describe characteristic define action involve object
Class library used create object characteristic set specific value
In OOP language like distinction clear class often contained library file like Java instantiated object residing memory although potentially able made separate file
In others like class library merely starting point includes entire state environment class instantiated object
Another solution library issue come using completely separate executables often lightweight form calling using RPC network another computer
This approach maximizes operating system code needed support library code used provide application support security every program
Additionally system require library exist machine forward request network
However approach mean every library call requires considerable amount overhead
RPC call much expensive calling shared library already loaded machine
This approach commonly used make heavy use remote call notably system
Code generation library generate transform
They used data access framework testing generate dynamic proxy object
They also used intercept field access
The system store file directory
The filename always start end suffix static library shared object dynamically linked library
Some system might multiple name dynamically linked library name name remaining name name might include major version library full version number example system would filename second major interface revision dynamically linked library
The file sometimes found library directory archive usable system
The system inherits static library convention library stored file use dynamically linked library suffix instead
Most library macOS however consist framework placed inside special directory called wrap library required file metadata
For example framework called would implemented bundle called either dynamically linked library file symlink dynamically linked library file
usually suffix although file name extension may identify dynamically linked library
library
The interface revision either encoded file name abstracted away using interface
Depending compiled file either static library representation dynamically linkable library needed compilation known
Unlike world us different file extension linking file one must first know regular static library import library
In latter case file must present run time

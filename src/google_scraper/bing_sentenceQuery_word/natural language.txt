field computer science artificial intelligence concerned interaction computer human natural language particular concerned programming computer fruitfully process large natural language data
Challenges natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding natural language generation
The history NLP generally started although work found earlier period
In published article titled proposed called criterion intelligence
The involved fully sixty Russian sentence English
The author claimed within three five year machine translation would solved problem
However real progress much slower found research failed fulfill expectation funding machine translation dramatically reduced
Little research machine translation conducted late first system developed
Some notably successful NLP system developed natural language system working restricted restricted vocabulary simulation written
Using almost information human thought emotion ELIZA sometimes provided startlingly interaction
When patient exceeded small knowledge base ELIZA might provide generic response example responding My head hurt Why say head hurt
During many programmer began write conceptual ontology structured information data

During time many written including
Up NLP system based complex set rule
Starting late however revolution NLP introduction algorithm language processing
This due steady increase computational power see gradual lessening dominance theory linguistics
whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged sort underlies approach language processing
Some machine learning algorithm produced system hard rule similar existing rule
However introduced use NLP increasingly research focused make soft decision based attaching weight feature making input data
The upon many system rely example statistical model
Such model generally robust given unfamiliar input especially input contains error common data produce reliable result integrated larger system comprising multiple subtasks
Many notable early success occurred field due especially work IBM Research successively complicated statistical model developed
These system able take advantage existing multilingual produced result law calling translation governmental proceeding official language corresponding system government
However system depended corpus specifically developed task implemented system often continues major limitation success system
As result great deal research gone method effectively learning limited amount data
Recent research increasingly focused algorithm
Such algorithm able learn data desired answer using combination annotated data
Generally task much difficult typically produce le accurate result given amount input data
However enormous amount data available including among thing entire content often make inferior result
In recent year flurry result showing technique achieving result many natural language task example language modeling parsing many others
Since statistical revolution late mid much Natural Language Processing research relied heavily
Formerly many task typically involved direct hand coding rule general robust natural language variation
The paradigm call instead using automatically learn rule analysis large typical example plural corpus set document possibly human computer annotation
Many different class machine learning algorithm applied NLP task
These algorithm take input large set feature generated input data
Some algorithm produced system hard rule similar system rule common
Increasingly however research focused make soft decision based attaching weight input feature
Such model advantage express relative certainty many different possible answer rather one producing reliable result model included component larger system
Systems based algorithm many advantage rule The following list commonly researched task NLP

In together set rule specific
The formal language set symbol letter token string language may formed
The string formed alphabet called word word belong particular formal language sometimes called
A formal language often defined mean also called
The field study primarily purely aspect internal structural pattern
Formal language theory sprang linguistics way understanding syntactic regularity
In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning
The study interpretation formal language called
In mathematical logic often done term
In model theory term occur formula interpreted object within fixed compositional interpretation rule determine truth value formula derived interpretation term formula interpretation term formula becomes true

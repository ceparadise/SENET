Students seeking
degree required take engineering prerequisite physic chemistry also take one le math course
However still need take semester science

need complete course rather four year
However
major required participate four semester independent work two junior year senior thesis count towards required course

major required perform one semester independent work count course
Both
student must complete computer science departmentals
Thus total course load relatively similar two option
Our experience employer graduate school care whether AB BSE understand distinction

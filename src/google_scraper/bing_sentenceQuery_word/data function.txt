In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
Computer program consist thousand line code like textbook thousand word
In way textbook divided chapter program divided related functionality using
In textbook specific concept covered basis
Similarly computer program specific functionality divided named
Programs usually integrate block code module already created project
The program us implemented function procedure module
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
BBC Simon Lumb describes function used programming In computer program often section program want repeat
Chunks instruction given name called
Algorithms broken procedure function
This save time call function required instead type whole instruction set
Programming language set also known function procedure
If programmer make one
Functions differ procedure function return value unlike procedure
However passed procedure function
In program drawing shape program could ask user shape draw
The instruction drawing square could captured
The algorithm action could set task If computer program set instruction could given name sequence would executed calling
A function could calculate VAT due good sold
The algorithm function could If computer program set instruction could given name would executed running calling function
In example function would called using The function would return value VAT used elsewhere

We seen one function already output message
To use function always write name followed parenthesis
The word basically mean input function
Then function action depending argument
When multiple argument function separate comma
For example give multiple argument print order space separating
We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error
For example requires least one input It important carefully read error get back code work
Python usually give helpful feedback went wrong
However sometimes need look around little bit diagnose problem example
Python say syntax error mean ca understand trying This exercise using function

Throughout book going using technique called We ca give complete definition term yet chapter introduce building block functional programming Basically mean function thing high school algebra teacher meant except function necessarily relate number
But essential idea like kind function described
In example name function function take called number number
In chapter going use computer explore function going use standard Scheme notation rest book
That chapter want separate idea function complexity programming language notation
For example real Scheme notation let write expression involve one function chapter use one time
To get chapter special computer interface first start running Scheme first chapter type tell Scheme read program using
If trouble loading program look Appendix A information
Then start program type You able carry interaction like following
In text printed type type printing As see different function different number argument
In example added two number took square root one number
However every function give exactly one result time use
To leave program type asks function
Experiment arithmetic function
Try different kind number including integer number decimal fraction
What try divide zero
Throughout chapter going let experiment function rather give long boring list one work
The boring list available reference page
Try These suggestion
Be creative type example
Not Scheme function deal number
A broader category argument including number also including English word like
Even meaningless sequence letter digit considered word
Try function accept word argument
What happens use number argument one
So far function fall one two category arithmetic function require number argument return number result word function accept word argument return word result
The one exception seen
What kind argument accept
What kind value return
The technical term kind data In principle could think almost anything type number contain digit
Such type legitimate sometimes useful also official type Scheme know
Types overlap example number also considered word
The technical term thing function accepts argument function
The name thing function return So domain word range number fact nonnegative integer
This example show range may exactly one standard data type nonnegative integer type Scheme
How talk domain range function
You could say example The function number domain number range
Or informally may also say take number argument return number
For function two argument language little le straightforward
The informal version still work take two integer argument return integer
But ca say The domain two integer domain function possible argument statement characteristic legal argument
By way making certain simplification chapter
For example Scheme function actually accept number argument two
But want go bell whistle start adding two number time
Here example illustrate domain function We going introduce data type function include type domain range
The next type bunch word enclosed parenthesis Do include punctuation character within sentence
Many function accept word domain also accept sentence
There also function accepts word sentence
Try example like sentence
Other important function used ask question
That range function contains two value one meaning true meaning false
Try numeric comparison function work word sentence
The question mark part name function
There also function whose domain range value
The two value true false called named George Boole developed formal tool used value mathematics
What good value
Often program must choose two option If number positive negative
Scheme function make choice based value
For experiment function
Its first argument must true false others anything
So far data type include number word sentence Booleans
Scheme several data type consider one
A used data
Here example The range nonnegative integer
But domain For example try using argument
If used computer programming language may seem strange use part computer data
Most language make sharp distinction program data
soon see ability treat function data help make Scheme programming powerful convenient
Try example Think carefully
You applying function sentence applying function function sentence
Other function used include whose domain integer whose domain everything
If reading book trying thing computer go along get work
Spend time getting used idea thinking
When done read ahead
The idea heart mathematics computer science
For example mathematician want think formally system number use function create integer
They say let suppose one number called zero let suppose given
By applying function repeatedly create
Functions important computer science give u way think simple English way think something happening something changing
A function embodies information taking something know returning something know
That computer They transform information produce new result
A lot mathematics taught school number seen function number
used function word sentence even function function
You imagine function transform information kind function French window function capital California
You done lot thinking function
You add two number make sense add two word number
Some function complicated domain acceptable value one argument depend specific value used one
The function example make sure tried positive negative number fractional well power
Part definition function always get answer whenever call function argument
The value returned function word change regardless anything else may computed meanwhile
One function explored chapter real function according rule one
The rule may seem restrictive indeed often convenient use name function loosely process give different result different circumstance
But see sometimes important stick strict definition refrain using process truly function
We hinted two different way thinking function
The first called Here function rule tell u transform information information
The function rule thing right
The actual thing word number whatever function manipulates
The second way thinking called In view function perfectly good thing
We use function argument another function example
Research college math student show second idea hard people worth effort see function function like make program much easier write
As homey analogy think carrot peeler
If focus attention want peeler represents process
We peeling carrot
We applying function carrot
It carrot count
But also think peeler thing right clean worry whether blade sharp enough
The big idea explored chapter although used lot Chapter function using result one function argument another function
crucial idea write large program defining bunch small function composing produce desired result
We start next chapter return real Scheme notation
In line following table left one piece information
Fill missing detail
What domain function
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
Make sure try lot case
Hint Think name
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
The following exercise ask function meet certain criterion
For convenience function chapter
List function chapter type return value always different type argument
List function chapter type return value sometimes different type argument
Mathematicians sometimes use term operator mean function two argument type return result type
Which function seen chapter satisfy definition
An operator possible argument
For example commutative
Which operator Exercise commutative
An operator possible argument
For example associative
Which operator Exercise associative
Certain punctuation character also used word let defer detail gotten know word function simpler example
Unless version Scheme complex number
Real mathematician say The domain Cartesian cross product integer integer
In order avoid mouthful use informal wording
Yes English word

In sequence program instruction perform specific task packaged unit
This unit used program wherever particular performed
Subprograms may defined within program separately used multiple program
In different programming language subroutine may called
The generic term sometimes used
The name suggests subroutine behaves much way computer program used one step larger program another subprogram
A subroutine often coded started called several time several place one execution program including subroutine branch back next instruction subroutine task done
credited invention concept termed contrasted
Subroutines powerful tool many includes support writing using
Judicious use subroutine example approach often substantially reduce cost developing maintaining large program increasing quality reliability
Subroutines often collected important mechanism sharing trading software
The discipline based subroutine attached object object
In method called executable program basically sequence subroutine call
The content subroutine body piece program code executed subroutine called invoked
A subroutine may written expects obtain one data value calling program replace formal parameter
The calling program provides actual value parameter called
Different programming language may use different convention passing argument The subroutine may return computed value caller provide various result value output parameter
Indeed common use subroutine implement purpose subroutine purely compute one result whose value entirely determined argument passed subroutine
Examples might include computing number
A subroutine call may also modifying reading writing creating halting program machine even delaying program execution specified time
A subprogram side effect may return different result time called even called argument
An example available many language return different number time called
The widespread use subroutine side effect characteristic language
A subroutine coded may one place perform task
This method allows direct implementation function defined recursive
A subroutine whose purpose compute one answer question sometimes called predicate
In language often subroutine called predicate since primarily determine success failure
For example type function subroutine main
usually include specific construct Some many distinguish function function subprogram provide explicit return value calling program subroutine procedure
In language function call normally embedded function may called
Procedure call either behave syntactically procedure may called explicitly invoked statement

Other language distinguish function subroutine
In strictly language subprogram mean various internal state program change
Functions always return result repeatedly called argument
Such language typically support function since subroutine return value use unless cause side effect
In subroutine may also simply called function confused different concept
A language usually translate procedure call return machine instruction according subroutine compiled separately program call
The instruction sequence corresponding call return statement called procedure
The advantage breaking program subroutine include Invoking subroutine versus using code imposes call mechanism
A subroutine typically requires standard code entry exit function usually saving return address minimum
The idea subroutine worked computing machine already existed time
The arithmetic conditional jump instruction planned ahead time changed relatively little special instruction used procedure call changed greatly year
The earliest computer microprocessor single subroutine call instruction
Subroutines could implemented required programmer use call series
Some early computer microprocessor subroutine call us dedicated hardware stack store return hardware support level subroutine nesting support recursive subroutine
Machines mid use saved instruction counter first memory location called subroutine
This allows arbitrarily deep level subroutine nesting support recursive subroutine
The one first computer subroutine call instruction feature support arbitrarily deep subroutine nesting also support recursive subroutine
In early assembler subroutine support limited
Subroutines explicitly separated main program indeed source code subroutine could interspersed subprogram
Some assembler would offer predefined generate call return sequence
By assembler usually much sophisticated support inline separately assembled subroutine could linked together
Even cumbersome approach subroutine proved useful
For one thing allowed use code many different program
Moreover memory scarce resource early computer subroutine allowed significant saving size program
Many early computer loaded program instruction memory
Each subroutine could provided separate piece tape loaded spliced main program mainline subroutine tape could used many different program
A similar approach applied computer used main input
The name originally meant library literal sense kept indexed collection tape collective use
To remove need computer designer eventually provided instruction whose operand instead location variable containing return address
On computer instead modifying subroutine return jump calling program would store return address variable subroutine completed would execute indirect jump would direct execution location given predefined variable
Another advance instruction combined saving return address calling jump thereby minimizing significantly
In IBM example branch instruction BAL BALR designed procedure calling would save return address processor register specified instruction
To return subroutine execute indirect branch instruction BR register
If subroutine needed register purpose calling another subroutine would save register content private memory location register
In system JSB instruction would perform similar task except return address stored memory location target branch
Execution procedure would actually begin next memory location
In HP assembly language one would write example call subroutine called MYSUB main program
The subroutine would coded The JSB instruction placed address NEXT instruction namely BB location specified operand namely MYSUB branched NEXT location namely AA MYSUB
The subroutine could return main program executing indirect jump JMP MYSUB I branched location stored location MYSUB
Compilers Fortran language could easily make use instruction available
This approach supported multiple level call however since return address parameter return value subroutine assigned fixed memory location allow recursive call
Incidentally similar method used early discover recalculation dependency spreadsheet
Namely location reserved cell store address
Since allowed natural recalculation order allows tree walk without reserving space stack memory limited small computer
Most modern implementation use special case implement subroutine call return
Each procedure call creates new entry called top stack procedure return stack frame deleted stack space may used procedure call
Each stack frame contains corresponding call typically includes procedure parameter internal variable return address
The call sequence implemented sequence ordinary instruction approach still used RISC VLIW architecture many traditional machine designed since late included special instruction purpose
The call stack usually implemented contiguous area memory
It arbitrary design choice whether bottom stack lowest highest address within area stack may grow forward backwards memory however many architecture chose latter
Some design notably implementation used two separate stack one mainly control information like return address loop counter data
The former worked like call stack indirectly accessible programmer language construct latter directly accessible
When procedure call first introduced important motivation save precious memory
With scheme compiler reserve separate space memory private data parameter return address local variable procedure
At moment stack contains private data call currently namely called returned yet
Because way program usually assembled library still uncommon find program include thousand subroutine handful active given moment
For program call stack mechanism could save significant amount memory
Indeed call stack mechanism viewed earliest simplest method
However another advantage call stack method allows since nested call procedure get separate instance private data
One disadvantage call stack mechanism increased cost procedure call matching return
The extra cost includes incrementing decrementing stack pointer architecture checking accessing local variable parameter address instead absolute address
The cost may realized increased execution time increased processor complexity
This overhead obvious objectionable return without making procedure call
To reduce overhead many modern compiler try delay use call stack really needed
For example call procedure may store return address parameter called procedure certain processor register transfer control procedure body simple jump
If procedure return without making call call stack used
If need call another procedure use call stack save content register return address needed return
In programming language subprogram termed classified associated
These language use special keyword indicate function take parameter especially C return value
Note function including modifying variable whose address passed parameter
Examples The function return value called function This function return result number call part expression This function convert number initial letter corresponding day week namely
The result calling might assigned variable
This function return value modifies variable whose address passed parameter would called
In example call subroutine define actual subroutine keyword must used subroutine name following
After content followed must typed
In language subprogram termed associated class
Visual Basic us various term called define passed parameter
By default unspecified variable registered passed default
Also function sub declared given public private friend designation determines whether accessed outside module project declared
The function return value called function This function return result number call part expression This function convert number initial letter corresponding day week namely
The result calling might assigned variable
This function return value modifies variable whose address passed parameter would called
In called procedure may passed providing information argument string length array bound
This allows procedure general eliminates need programmer pas information
By default pass argument reference
A trivial subroutine change sign element array might look like This could called various array follows A subprogram may find useful make use certain amount space used execution subprogram hold intermediate result
Variables stored scratch space termed scratch space termed
An activation record typically tell pas control back subprogram finish
A subprogram may number nature call site
If recursion supported subprogram may even call causing execution suspend another execution subprogram occurs
useful mean simplify complex algorithm break complex problem
Recursive language generally provide new copy local variable call
If programmer desire value local variable stay call declared language global value common area used
Here example recursive subroutine find number Early language like initially support recursion variable statically allocated well location return address
Most computer late support hardware stack register
Modern language almost invariably use stack usually supported modern computer instruction set provide fresh activation record every execution subprogram
That way nested execution free modify local variable without concern effect suspended execution progress
As nested call accumulate structure formed consisting one activation record suspended subprogram
In fact stack structure virtually ubiquitous activation record commonly termed
Some language also support subroutine callable within outer parent subroutine
Inner subroutine access local variable outer subroutine called
This accomplished storing extra context information within activation record also termed
If subprogram executed properly even another execution subprogram already progress subprogram said
A recursive subprogram must reentrant
Reentrant subprogram also useful situation since multiple thread call subprogram without fear interfering
In slightly le restrictive similar requirement application program shared many thread
In environment generally one stack
An environment fully support may use data structure stack store activation record
In sometimes desirable number function name operating different type data different parameter profile
For example square root function might defined operate real complex value matrix
The algorithm used case different return result may different
By writing three separate function name programmer convenience remember different name type data
Further subtype defined real separate positive negative real two function written real one return real parameter positive another return complex value parameter negative
In series function name accept different parameter profile parameter different type function said
Here example subroutine overloading In code two function name different parameter
As another example subroutine might construct accept direction trace path point screen
There plethora parameter could passed constructor colour trace starting x trace speed
If programmer wanted constructor able accept color parameter could call another constructor accepts color turn call constructor parameter passing set parameter X Y would generally centered screen placed origin speed would set another value coder choosing
A subprogram together value variable captured environment created
Closures notable feature Lisp programming language introduced
Depending implementation closure serve mechanism
A wide number convention coding subroutine developed
Pertaining naming many developer adopted approach name subroutine certain task make inquiry used substitute variable
Some programmer suggest subroutine perform one task subroutine perform one task split subroutine
They argue subroutine key component role program must remain distinct
Proponents modularizing code advocate subroutine minimal dependency piece code
For example use generally deemed unwise advocate perspective add tight coupling subroutine global variable
If coupling necessary advice subroutine accept passed instead
However increasing number parameter passed subroutine affect code readability
Besides effect subroutine may need inform calling program condition may occurred execution
In language programming standard often done integer value placed subroutine standard location encodes normal exceptional condition
In return code expected subroutine return value often designed multiple could used direct index branch table often located immediately call instruction avoid extra conditional test improving efficiency
In one would write example There significant runtime calling subroutine including passing argument branching subprogram branching back caller
The overhead often includes saving restoring certain processor register allocating reclaiming call frame storage
In language subroutine call also implies automatic testing subroutine return code handling may raise
In language significant source overhead intensively used method call
There seemingly obvious optimization procedure call applied procedure may side effect
For example expression function must called twice two call may return different result
Moreover value must fetched second call since first call may changed
Determining whether subprogram may side effect difficult indeed
So optimization safe purely functional programming language compiler typical imperative programming usually assume worst
A method used eliminate overhead subprogram body versus branching subroutine back
Not avoid call overhead also allows procedure effectively taking account context argument call
The inserted body optimized compiler
Inlining however usually increase code size unless program contains one call subroutine subroutine body le code call overhead

In describes situation data location accessed different symbolic name program
Thus modifying data one name implicitly modifies value associated aliased name may expected programmer
As result aliasing make particularly difficult understand analyze optimize program
intend make compute useful information understanding aliasing program
For example implementation perform
One exploit implementation programming language compiler computer architecture convention achieve aliasing effect writing outside array type
This invokes according C language specification however many implementation C show aliasing effect described
If array created variable laid memory directly beside one could index outside array directly change variable changing relevant array element
For example array size example sake calling next another variable call
element would aliased adjacent memory
This possible implementation C array block contiguous memory array element merely referenced offset address beginning block multiplied size single element
Since C bound checking indexing addressing outside array possible
Note aforementioned aliasing behaviour
Some implementation may leave space array variable stack instance align variable memory location multiple architecture native
The C standard generally specify data laid memory
section
It erroneous compiler omit aliasing effect access fall outside bound array
Another variety aliasing occur language refer one location memory one name example
See C xor swap algorithm function assumes two pointer passed distinct fact equal alias function fails
This common problem function accept pointer argument tolerance lack thereof aliasing must carefully documented particularly function perform complex manipulation memory area passed
Controlled aliasing behaviour may desirable case aliasing behaviour specified unlike enabled memory layout C
It common practice
The specifies construct aliasing behaviour loop
This allows certain data structure modified directly le code
For example print result
If one wanted bypass aliasing effect one could copy content index variable another change copy
often make conservative assumption variable presence pointer
For example knowing value variable normally allows certain optimization
However compiler use information assignment another variable example C could alias
This could case assignment like
As effect assignment value x would changed well propagating information statement following would potentially wrong indeed alias
However information pointer constant propagation process could make query like alias
Then answer propagated safely
Another optimization impacted aliasing code reordering
If compiler decides aliased code us change value moved assignment would improve enable carried
To enable optimization predictable manner including newer edition see section paragraph specifies illegal exception access memory location using pointer different type
A compiler may therefore assume pointer alias
This rule known sometime allows impressive increase performance known break otherwise valid code
Several software project intentionally violate portion standard
For example implement reference counting required change basic object structs Python enable optimization
The strict aliasing cause problem optimization inlined code
In case compiled option invoked prevent unwanted optimization could yield unexpected code
The term also used describe situation due either hardware design choice hardware failure one available address bit used memory selection process
This may design decision address bit available necessary support installed memory device
In failure one address bit may shorted together may forced logic supply voltage logic
For example assume memory design location requiring address line since
Address bit named decoded select unique memory location follows standard fashion In table unique combination address bit selects different memory location
However one address bit say shorted ground table would modified follows In case always zero first four memory location duplicated appear second four
Memory location become inaccessible
If change occurred different address bit decoding result would different general effect would loss single address bit cut available memory space half resulting duplication aliasing remaining space

There expectation reader
You need aware CNNs
If I would like go
Next I run small recap relevant point CNN
That way easily grab comparison done
So without ado let dive
CNN essentially system stack lot neuron together
These network proven exceptionally great handling image classification problem
It would hard neural network map pixel image since computationally really expensive
So convolutional method help simplify computation great extent without losing essence data
Convolution basically lot matrix multiplication summation result
After image fed network set kernel filter scan perform convolution operation
This lead creation feature map inside network
These feature next pas via activation layer pooling layer succession based number layer network continues
Activation layer required induce sense network eg
Pooling eg max pooling help reducing training time
The idea pooling creates summary
It also give little bit positional translational invariance object detection
At end network pas via classifier like softmax classifier give u class
Training happens based back propagation error matched labelled data
Non linearity also help solving vanishing gradient step
CNNs perform exceptionally great classifying image close data set
If image rotation tilt different orientation CNNs poor performance
This problem solved adding different variation image training
In CNN layer understands image much granular level
Lets understand example
If trying classify ship horse
The innermost layer layer understands small curve edge
The layer might understand straight line smaller shape like mast ship curvature entire tail
Higher layer start understanding complex shape like entire tail ship hull
Final layer try see holistic picture like entire ship entire horse
We use pooling layer make compute reasonable time frame
But essence also loses positional data
Pooling help creating positional invariance
Otherwise CNNs would fit image data close training set
This invariance also lead triggering false positive image component ship correct order
So system trigger right match left image
You observer clearly see difference
The pooling layer also add sort invariance
This never intention pooling layer
What pooling supposed introduce positional orientational proportional invariance
But method use get us crude
In reality add sort positional invariance
Thus leading dilemma detecting right ship image correct ship
What needed invariance equivariance
Invariance make CNN tolerant small change viewpoint
make CNN understand rotation proportion change adapt accordingly spatial positioning inside image lost
A ship still smaller ship CNN reduce size detect
This lead u recent advancement Capsule Networks
Every day advancement field Neural Networks
Some brilliant mind working field
You pretty much assume every paper topic almost ground breaking path changing
Sara Sabour Nicholas Frost Geoffrey Hinton released paper titled day back
Now one Godfathers Deep Learning releasing paper bound ground breaking
The entire Deep Learning community going crazy paper read article
So paper talk Capsules CapsNet run MNIST
MNIST database tagged handwritten digit image
Results showing significant increase performance case overlapped digit
The paper compare current CNNs
In paper author project human brain module called capsule
These capsule particularly good handling different type visual stimulus encoding thing like pose position size orientation deformation velocity albedo hue texture etc
The brain must mechanism routing low level visual information belief best capsule handling
Capsule nested set neural layer
So regular neural network keep adding layer
In CapsNet would add layer inside single layer
Or word nest neural layer inside another
The state neuron inside capsule capture property one entity inside image
A capsule output vector represent existence entity
The orientation vector represents property entity
The vector sent possible parent neural network
For possible parent capsule find prediction vector
Prediction vector calculated based multiplying weight weight matrix
Whichever parent largest scalar prediction vector product increase capsule bond
Rest parent decrease bond
This method superior current mechanism like
Max pooling route based strongest feature detected lower layer
Apart dynamic routing CapsNet talk adding squashing capsule
Squashing
So instead adding squashing layer like CNN add squashing nested set layer
So squashing function get applied vector output capsule
The paper introduces new squashing function
You see image
ReLU similar non linearity function work well single neuron
But paper found squashing function work best capsule
This try squash length output vector capsule
It squash small vector try limit output vector vector long
The dynamic routing add extra computation cost
But definitely give added advantage
Now need realise paper almost brand new concept capsule throughly tested
It work MNIST data still need proven much larger dataset across variety class
There already within day update paper raise following concern The current implementation capsule scope improvement
But also keep mind Hinton paper first place say So lot theory
Lets fun build CapsNet
I take code setup basic CapsNet MNIST data
I comment inside code follow line line get understanding work
I take two important piece code
Rest go repo fork start working The entire Capsule layer
This stacked created Capsule Network
Code CapsNet The entire code along training evaluation module present
It
You use freely
I want give credit code
So went CapsNet built
We tried understand capsule nothing nested neural layer high level
We also looked CapsNet delivers rotational invariance
It equivariant spatial setup entity inside image
I sure still question answered
Capsules best implementation probably biggest question
But post initial push trying throw light topic
If query please share
I answer best knowledge
By clapping le signal u story really stand

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue

That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

The title say sit restarting computer tend fix thing
It seems like IT folk always ask Have restarted PC
But Why
Basically anything got mess get chance start
Imagine making toast burn
Throwing away starting one way fix problem always work better scraping burnt bit toast
One major reason computer slows Random Access Memory RAM used
The operating system well program running use RAM
However much accessed fast
If computer trying use lot RAM often availablee slows
It need create file extra hard drive act extra le efficient RAM
This among thing make computer slow
Closing program free RAM space may occurred
That mean program may accidentally taken RAM free closed
Ahhh say going eat RAM
Nope
If restart computer RAM cleared
You got avaliable RAM computer run faster
There problem could fixed restart
For example program somehow begin use huge amount processor cycle cycle consists calculation calculation make computer compute aka work
When computer restarted control processor given bootloader handed OS start scratch
It longer dominated greedy program
Yet another possibility computer overheating
Overheating simply put good computer
Turning machine leaving cool minute could hurt
In fact computer set shut reach certain internal temperature
In summary restart put computer state right software controlling right possibly cooler hardware state already known work right
Good question
The short answer depends The longer answer Windows limited resource application use Memory Window Handles File Handles etc
badly written application give resource back Windows finished Windows run resource
This cause problem application
Obviously applies operating system Two reason I know ancient thread I feel like Microsoft developer explains Gradual slowness issue often chalked
Contrary comment still real problem modern Windows
Either component stay running preventing memory reclaimed quit plurality running application user started leak occur time sometimes severely
In latter case running application often simpler IT guy say restart instead close apps check task tray make sure really gone make sure running background process service get idea
As mentioned elsewhere lot problem plain old software hung service infinite waiting shared resource etc etc
I think leak pending library change explain majority though
Have ever watched The IT Crowd
IT support people use Try restarting first response To clean RAM probably By posting answer agree

A restore point sometimes called name given collection important system file stored given date time
What System Restore revert saved restore point
See instruction process
If restore point exists computer System Restore nothing revert tool wo work
If trying recover major problem need move another troubleshooting step
The amount space restore point take limited see old restore point removed make room newer one space filled
This allotted space shrink even overall free space shrink one several reason I recommend keeping hard drive space free time
Using System Restore restore document music email personal file kind
Depending perspective positive negative feature
The good news choosing restore point two week old wo erase music bought email downloaded
The bad news wo restore accidentally deleted file wish could get back though might solve problem
A restore point created automatically
Restore point also created automatically predetermined time differs depending version Windows installed You also manually create restore point time
See How To Create Restore Point instruction
All necessary information return computer current state included restore point
In version Windows includes important system file program executables supporting file much
In Windows Windows Vista restore point actually volume shadow copy kind snapshot entire drive personal file
However System Restore file restored
In Windows XP restore point collection important file restored System Restore
The Windows Registry several important part Windows saved well file certain certain folder specified file located
Restore point occupy much space detail vary greatly version Windows It possible change default restore point storage limit
There error
Please try

Must restart handler within another handler directly code exceptional condition detected
If must within handler
seems like needle extra step
What added value restart handler opposed regular handler dispensed restart handler altogether regular handler
Would make difference power expressibility language
The following answer taken grain salt
It based understanding section Conditions however I never written single line Dylan code even read much reference manual said section
Must restart handler within another handler directly code exceptional condition detected
A shown
It whenever statement syntactically valid
There special mechanism installing handler condition opposed handler condition contrast language Common Lisp R
The difference signaling opposed signaling condition handler within another handler rest handler code lexically follows executed even handler return
In case execution handler well execution handler invoked handler stop value returned handler become value returned handler

It clear happens handler performs exit targeting location inside unit handler
What added value restart handler opposed regular handler dispensed restart handler altogether regular handler
Would make difference power expressibility language
The mechanism effect statement whose selection condition determined dynamically code external function statement defined
A signal emulated condition mechanism provides two formal facility otherwise would established convention order achieve similar functionality By posting answer agree

Want watch later
unforeseen event positive negative influence project
Effective risk management essential make sure materializing risk jeopardize project objective
The begin identifying possible project risk assessing occurrence would project
Using information suitable risk response strategy applied risk
Once risk response planned project manager monitor project adjust risk management plan needed
In lesson focus attention two specific risk response risk avoidance risk mitigation
Both strategy usually applied negative risk threat referred risk
These suitable positive risk opportunity
One risk response strategy
This strategy entail adjusting project plan condition triggering risk event longer present risk eliminated
While strategy applied project risk effective preventing risk
Some example project plan adjustment might help avoid certain risk include changing foreign supplier local one avoid exposure exchange rate volatility risk choosing proven technology instead innovative one avoid technological risk
In contrast risk avoidance eliminate risk completely
Instead reduces probability risk occur reduces negative impact risk materialize
This realistic frequently applied risk response strategy
One common activity aimed reducing probability risk occurring testing
Extensive testing early stage IT project reduces probability severe technological problem later
An important step selecting appropriate risk mitigation strategy assessing cause risk event aiming risk response directly main cause
For example railway construction project one main risk bad weather construction stop rainy day
While impossible guarantee sunshine day adjusting project schedule majority work scheduled summer reduce risk
Get FREE access day create account
An alternative approach reduce impact risk project
One way achieve try solution smaller scale rolling whole organization
For example new range cake first sold one coffee shop offering customer whole chain
Reducing impact also possible without reducing scale
For example let say worried permanent staff unable deal number customer Black Friday decide hire additional temporary staff day
Events may may take place positive negative impact project occur known
Part planning risk response previously identified assessed risk
Two main risk characteristic assessed probability risk occurring impact risk project
adjusts project try make sure risk eliminated
reduces probability negative impact risk reducing likelihood occurring impact project

What meant uncertainty avoidance

What element risk involved uncertainty avoidance

What possible social organizational problem caused concentrating risk reduction
Justify answer using appropriate reasoning example

In culture high uncertainty avoidance emotion displayed way everything different dangerous
People resist change worry future

Defining computer security trivial
The difficulty lie developing definition broad enough valid regardless system described yet specific enough describe security really
In generic sense security freedom risk danger
In context computer science security prevention protection This Security ability system protect information system resource respect confidentiality integrity
Note scope second definition includes system resource include CPUs disk program addition information
Computer security frequently associated three core area conveniently summarized acronym CIA A strong security protocol address three area
Take example Netscape SSL Secure Sockets Layer protocol
It enabled explosion ecommerce really trust precisely lack trust
SSL overcomes lack trust transacting party ensuring confidentiality encryption integrity checksum authentication via server certificate see Chapter
Computer security restricted three broad concept
Additional idea often considered part taxonomy computer security include These additional element neatly integrate singular definition
From one perspective concept privacy confidentiality security quite distinct posse different attribute
Privacy property individual confidentiality property data security property assigned computer hardware software system
From practical perspective concept interwoven
A system maintain data confidentiality individual privacy could theoretically even mathematically secure probably would wise deploy anywhere real world
Computer security also analyzed function
It broken five distinct functional area Analyzing security function valuable part security planning process strong security policy address five area starting recovery
This book however primarily concerned prevention detection
Computer security also frequently defined term several interdependent domain roughly map specific department job title This text solely concerned latter two
System network security difficult impossible separate UNIX system
Nearly every UNIX distribution past fifteen year included protocol implementation well numerous network service FTP Telnet DNS recently HTTP
In spirit practicality I like straightforward definition promulgated Simson Garfinkel Gene Spafford Practical UNIX Internet Security A computer secure depend software behave expect
In essence computer secure trust
Data entered today still tomorrow unaltered form
If made service x z available yesterday still available today
I also like practical definition offered Tomas Olovsson narrowed bit A secure system system enough trust put use together sensitive information
These practical definition circumvent obvious element secure system hard unauthorized person break value work necessary unauthorized person break exceed value protected data
Increasing attacker workload risk detection critical element computer security

I hoping could explain two term namely risk avoidance risk transfer
Also risk avoided transferring
Risk avoidance taking risk first place investing product said transfer akin buying insurance
You make investment exposed risk protected happens
The board director set firm risk appetite risk investment willing exposed hope making money risk
For risk firm willing exposed hope making profit take must decide handle
They protect hedging investing product pay risk realized like insurance

They diversify bring risk way
This risk reduction
They ignore nothing hope best
This retaining risk For risk firm chose exposed avoided exposed first place
Imagine airline like Air Canada course business flying people around globe exposed risk increasing price jet fuel
Jet fuel cost go eats profit
They want protect increase price jet fuel spot market board say OK trader taking position jet fuel future jet fuel future let pretend simplicity protect adverse price movement
They may OK trader taking position complicated product like synthetic CDOs
In case decided transfer risk increasing spot price jet fuel hedging investing future

Since transferred risk hedging wo negatively affect since price go make money future like insurance policy
The board decided invest super complicated synthetic CDOs thus avoided risk come investment
would company deciding invest corporate bond make profit
They exposed risk company invest go bankrupt investment loses value
To transfer risk protect hedge buy product pay one company invested default

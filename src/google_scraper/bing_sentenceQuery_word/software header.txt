A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates

Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone

That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

I student Computer Science I hearing word overhead lot come program sort
What mean exactly
It resource required set operation
It might seem unrelated necessary
It like need go somewhere might need car
But would lot overhead get car drive street might want walk
However overhead would worth going across country
In computer science sometimes use car go street better way worth time learn walk
The meaning word differ lot context
In general resource often memory CPU time used contribute directly intended result required technology method used
Examples Wikipedia In computer science generally considered combination excess indirect computation time memory bandwidth resource required attain particular goal
It special case engineering overhead
You tired cant work
You eat food
The energy spent looking food getting actually eating consumes energy overhead
Overhead something wasted order accomplish task
The goal make overhead small
In computer science let say want print number thats task
But storing number setting display print calling routine print accessing number variable overhead
Overhead typically reffers amount extra resource memory processor time etc
different programming algorithm take
For example overhead inserting balanced Binary Tree could much larger insert simple Linked List insert take longer use processing power balance Tree result longer percieved operation time user
For programmer overhead refers system resource consumed code running giving platform given set input data
Usually term used context comparing different implementation possible implementation
For example might say particular approach might incur considerable CPU overhead another might incur memory overhead yet another might weighted network overhead entail external dependency example
Let give specific example Compute average arithmetic mean set number
The obvious approach loop input keeping running total count
When last number encountered signaled end file EOF sentinel value GUI buttom whatever simply divide total number input done
This approach incurs almost overhead term CPU memory resource
It trivial task
Another possible approach slurp input list
iterate list calculate sum divide number valid item list
By comparison approach might incur arbitrary amount memory overhead
In particular bad implementation might perform sum operation using recursion without
Now addition memory overhead list also introducing stack overhead different sort memory often limited resource form memory
Yet another arguably absurd approach would post input SQL table RDBMS
Then simply calling SQL SUM function column table
This shift local memory overhead server incurs network overhead external dependency execution
Note remote server may may particular memory overhead associated task might shove value immediately storage example
Hypothetically might consider implementation sort cluster possibly make averaging trillion value feasible
In case necessary encoding distribution value mapping node result reduction would count overhead
We also talk overhead incurred factor beyond programmer code
For example compilation code bit processor might entail greater overhead one would see old architecture
This might involve larger memory overhead alignment issue CPU overhead CPU forced adjust bit ordering used instruction etc
Note disk space taken code library etc
usually referred overhead rather called footprint
Also base memory program consumes without regard data set processing called footprint well
You could use dictionary
The definition
But save time Overhead work required productive work
For instance algorithm run useful work requires memory work
This memory allocation take time directly related work done therefore overhead
You check
But mainly action resource used
Like familiar value type reference type
Reference type memory overhead require memory value type
A concrete example overhead difference local procedure call remote procedure call
For example classic RPC many remote framework like EJB function method call look coder whether local memory call distributed network call
For example Is normal method remote method
From see ca tell
But imagine difference execution time two call dramatic
So core implementation cost overhead involved quite different
Think overhead time required manage thread coordinate among
It burden thread enough task
In case overhead cost come saved time using threading code take time sequential one

Commenting involves placing inside computer program detailing
Proper use commenting make code maintenance much easier well helping make finding bug faster
Further commenting important writing function people use
Remember well documented code important correctly working code
All program commented manner easily describe English purpose code algorithm used accomplish purpose
A user able utilize previously written program function without ever look code simply reading comment
Commenting art describing program going high level English statement
Commenting best done actually writing code program
Comments specially marked line text program
There usually two syntactic way comment
The first called implied applies single line source code program
The second called comment refers usually refers paragraph text
A block comment start symbol end symbol everything ignored computer
Here syntax comment variable language
In many comment use Matlab style mentally replace appropriate style language
Java Action script use single line
Everything end line file ignored program use human reader code
use multiple line Matlab use single line
Everything end line file ignored program use human reader code
use comment Multiline comment repeat left side paragraph
The comment character Matlab
Everything end line program considered comment
As Matlab single line comment mark entire region comment called block comment use single line comment
The single line comment
Everything end line comment
To mark entire region comment use start comment end comment
Comments occur following place The top program file
This called
It include defining information wrote code
See Header Comment Above every function
This called function header provides information purpose program
When one function file function header file header comment merged single comment
See Function Header In line Any tricky code immediately obvious trying accomplish comment right line
Comments useful high level description program
They restate something obvious
By using appropriate variable name much program almost easy read English
Primarily single block comment placed top function file describe purpose code algorithm used accomplish goal
comment used sparingly code
When use comment place next code self explanatory
This comment detail idea behind code accomplished
It may also say accomplished algorithm complex
In line comment found general body program
They usually short line two comment making note going
In line comment usually made using single line commenting syntax language
You add comment wherever think little bit English explanation would useful either someone else like TA going read code
Such comment used whenever code transparent easy follow simply name variable
Be aware line comment bad
See section self documenting code allows programmer minimize number necessary comment
Self documenting code us well chosen variable name function name make code read close English possible
This goal
For example naming variable g little meaning naming variable gravity give much better description variable contain
By using proper variable function name minimize amount external documentation necessary
For example compare following two piece code
File Header comment used identify file wrote date written description solved code file
All program file header comment located file
The file header comment detail file
Among thing The author date course number
A description code file accomplishes A list modification bug fix file
Note important program written class important real world
A good file header comment fully describe project purpose code file
A programmer matter able read file header able understand high level idea purpose behind code well method used
This save many hour time getting new project member speed
Function Header comment used describe purpose function
Every function must separate header comment
Function header serve describe algorithm function implement without forcing reader interpret code
Further serf visually separate function C multiple function written single file
Short simple function line description
As rule thumb longer function longer header comment
Remember always use appropriate amount whitespace good formatting style
This important coding writing technical paper
By using function header need use fewer comment actual code segment function
This make program cleaner readable
Here example one might expect How one format indent prettifies one code important
For see section Programming Style

Dec unique visitor Software Development Conference A note reader As per request developed set feature allow reduce noise losing sight anything important
choosing topic interested
The role software Engineer necessarily require degree Computer Science
However since Yahoo recently due fake computer science college degree point discussion someone need university degree
For instance article Dobb Andrew Binstock discus whether software engineer really require degree computer science perform excellent job
According Binstock Software engineer latest term undergo peculiar disconnection reality implies
In earlier generation title analyst favored term
In world yore entry level programmer
When change title needed reflect tenure programmer elevated
Then ultimately analyst
This metamorphosis might implied programming activity employee finally left behind
But fact analyst even programming junior brother
Analysis often large part job except insofar position require analysis adjunct programming
The article refers Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates software engineer successful without degree computer science
Thus Binstock conclusion The equivalent affords plenty room candidate demonstrated coding prowess lacking academic formation
In sum welcome party
And mind I raise pen dear reader software engineer
Not reader commented agree Binstock conclusion
For example user pjmlp explains In every profession learning path prof person question required set skill able offer certain quality work
My experience self taught programmer able deliver quality software shop expect skill set reduced able learn free time
RussG different viewpoint Sadly degree computer science reliably make one good programmer
Computer science computer programming generally different thing graduate seem come expectation work academia well large team building application
Another important point discussion context might specific role software engineering software architect
Does software architect responsible backbone system require computer science degree also self taught software engineer
Or engineer need academic education profound practical experience
As Einstein said In theory theory practice
In practice

In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order
See alternative string ordering preserve
A number additional operation string commonly occur formal theory
These given article
Strings admit following interpretation node graph The natural topology set string string discrete topology natural topology set infinite string viewing set infinite string set finite string
This construction used construction yield topology
string representation topology found normalizing according
A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero
See also
String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function
pointer dynamically allocated memory area might expanded needed
See also
Both character termination length code limit string For example C character array contain null NUL character handled directly C string library function Strings using length code limited maximum value length code
Both limitation overcome clever programming
It possible create data structure function manipulate problem associated character termination principle overcome length code bound
It also possible optimize string represented using technique replacing repeated character character value length
While representation common others possible
Using make certain string operation insertion deletion concatenation efficient
The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated
In case program code accessing string data requires ensure inadvertently access change data outside string memory limit
String data frequently obtained program
As responsibility program validate string ensure represents expected format
Performing limited validation cause program vulnerable attack
Sometimes string need embedded inside text file intended consumption machine
This needed example source code programming language configuration file
In case NUL character work well terminator since normally invisible difficult input via keyboard
Storing string length would also inconvenient manual computation tracking length tedious
Two common representation While character string common us string string computer science may refer generically sequence homogeneously typed data
A example may used represent retrieved communication medium
This data may may represented datatype depending need application desire programmer capability programming language used
If programming language string implementation data corruption may ensue
C programmer draw sharp distinction string aka string character definition always null terminated byte string pseudo string may stored array often null terminated
Using function byte string often seems work later lead
There many processing string various
Some category algorithm include Advanced string algorithm often employ complex mechanism data structure among
The name coined computer scientist issue algorithm data structure used string processing
Character string useful datatype several language designed order make string processing application easy write
Examples include following language Many utility perform simple string manipulation used easily program powerful string processing algorithm
Files finite stream may viewed string
Some like use string hold command interpreted
Recent including Perl Ruby Tcl employ facilitate text operation
Perl particularly noted regular expression use many language application implement
Some language Perl Ruby support permit arbitrary expression evaluated included string literal
used manipulate string change edit content string
They also used query information string
They usually used within context
The basic example string function function function return length string counting terminator character string internal structural information modify string
This function often named
For example would return
In alternative string
It ability altered adding appending whereas String normally fixed
standard way handle text use
Any given Java mean changed
A
Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent
Either way effect noticeable modern desktop computer
As well shortcoming array inherent
In order insert remove character arbitrary position whole section array must moved
The method attractive environment low processing power take ability using much memory likely also premium environment
This point however trivial considering space required creating many instance Strings order process
As well StringBuffer optimized waste little memory possible

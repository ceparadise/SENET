Nowadays system big complex team architect analyst programmer tester user must work together create million line code drive enterprise
More To manage number system development life cycle SDLC model created waterfall fountain spiral build fix rapid prototyping incremental synchronize stabilize
The oldest best known waterfall sequence stage output stage becomes input next
These stage characterized divided different way including following The waterfall model well understood useful
In Information Center Quarterly article Larry Runge say SDLC work well automating activity clerk accountant
It work nearly well building system knowledge worker people help desk expert trying solve problem executive trying lead company Fortune
Another problem waterfall model assumes role user specifying requirement requirement specified advance
Unfortunately requirement grow change throughout process beyond calling considerable feedback iterative consultation
Thus many SDLC model developed
The fountain model recognizes although activity ca start others need design start coding considerable overlap activity throughout development cycle
The spiral model emphasizes need go back reiterate earlier stage number time project progress
It actually series short waterfall cycle producing early prototype representing part entire project
This approach help demonstrate proof concept early cycle accurately reflects disorderly even chaotic evolution technology
Build fix crudest method
Write code keep modifying customer happy
Without planning risky
In rapid prototyping sometimes called rapid application development model initial emphasis creating prototype look act like desired product order test usefulness
The prototype essential part requirement determination phase may created using tool different used final product
Once prototype approved discarded real software written
The incremental model divide product build section project created tested separately
This approach likely find error user requirement quickly since user feedback solicited stage code tested sooner written
The synchronize stabilize method combine advantage spiral model technology overseeing managing source code
This method allows many team work efficiently parallel
This approach defined David Yoffie Harvard University Michael Cusumano MIT
They studied Microsoft developed Internet Explorer Netscape Communications developed Communicator finding common thread way two company worked
For example company nightly compilation called build entire project bringing together current component
They established release date expended considerable effort stabilize code released
The company alpha release internal testing one beta release usually wider testing outside company finally release candidate leading gold master released manufacturing
At point release specification would frozen remaining time spent fixing bug
Both Microsoft Netscape managed million line code specification changed evolved time
Design review strategy session frequent everything documented
Both company built contingency time schedule release deadline got close chose scale back product feature rather let milestone date slip

Earlier talked involved designing building computer programme
Now going put stage context imagine company contracted build software monitor online sale red green blue sock chicken
Over coffee biscuit board room discus exactly need programme earth want sell red blue green chicken sock
What wrong orange
Or pink
What getting apart chocolate biscuit something actually taste like tea mixed gravy specification requirement going measuring efficiency software
Who using software IT skill
How want Data stored sale chicken sock presented
You also need know company run programme slip seamlessly business model
Here design stage kick begin sketching flowchart followed implementation start building testing programme
Finally maintenance phase monitor day day running fix glitch thrown unforeseen user action
This look like purely linear process fact four life cycle model choose appropriate company programme
First waterfall
Each stage separate hop sequentially one next specification design design implementation right maintenance
It easy manage model best simple project
An incremental model start specification stage subdivides three path move design implementation
Devilishly clever
This mean three ace team work three separate part programme
Genius
A spiral model used mostly large project
Imagine spiral drawn onto page divided four quadrant represents different phase cycle whether risk analysis testing progress review evaluation
As project develops centre spiral move round quadrant continual analysis evaluation
Lastly model
Similar waterfall stage also go review testing stage final implementation stage

A basic unit used computer science
Nodes device data point larger network
Devices personal computer cell phone printer node
When defining node internet node anything
Nodes individual part larger data structure
Nodes contain also may link node
Links node often implemented
Nodes often arranged tree structure
These structure
A node represents information contained single structure
These node may contain value condition possibly serve another independent data structure
Nodes represented single parent node
The highest point tree structure called root node parent node serf parent node tree
The height node determined total number edge path node furthest leaf node height tree equal height root node
Node depth determined distance particular node root node
The root node said depth zero
Data discovered along network path
An IP address us kind system node define location network
Another common use node tree
In programming used communicate information computer programmer computer alike
For reason XML used create common used serf base development modern web like
Though similar approached programmer typically language used develop website text design
While XML HTML XHTML provide language expression serf translator
Different type node tree represented specific interface
In word node type defined communicates node
Each node node type property specifies type node sibling leaf
For example node type property constant property node property specifies type node
So node type property constant node one know node object object Element
This object us Element interface define method property particular node
Node Types Different node type description A node object represented single node tree
It element node attribute node text node type described section node type
All object inherit property method dealing parent child node object parent child node
For example text node child node similar node add child node result error
Objects DOM tree may addressed manipulated using method object
The public interface DOM specified API
The history Document Object Model intertwined history late well first widely implemented

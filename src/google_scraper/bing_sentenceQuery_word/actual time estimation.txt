discipline applies method industry profession
professional qualified field intense education experience
In many country actuary must demonstrate competence passing series rigorous professional examination
Actuarial science includes number interrelated subject including
Historically actuarial science used deterministic model construction table premium
The science gone revolutionary change last year due proliferation high speed computer union actuarial model modern financial theory
Many university undergraduate graduate degree program actuarial science
In study published job search website CareerCast ranked actuary job United States
The study used five key criterion rank job environment income employment outlook physical demand stress
A similar study included actuary among Best Professions expects great demand future
Actuarial science became formal mathematical discipline late century increased demand insurance coverage burial annuity
These long term coverage required money set aside pay future benefit annuity death benefit many year future
This requires estimating future contingent event rate mortality age well development mathematical technique discounting value fund set aside invested
This led development important actuarial concept referred future sum
Certain aspect actuarial method discounting pension fund come criticism modern
Actuarial science also applied
In form insurance coverage generally provided renewable period yearly
Coverage cancelled end period either party
company tend specialize complexity diversity risk
One division organize around personal commercial line insurance
Personal line insurance individual include fire auto homeowner theft umbrella coverage
Commercial line address insurance need business include property business continuation product liability vehicle worker compensation fidelity surety insurance
The insurance industry also provides coverage exposure catastrophe risk earthquake patent infringement form corporate espionage terrorism satellite launch
Actuarial science provides data collection measurement estimating forecasting valuation tool provide financial underwriting data management ass marketing opportunity nature risk
Actuarial science often help ass overall risk catastrophic event relation underwriting capacity surplus
In field actuarial science used design price reinsurance retrocession arrangement establish reserve fund known claim future claim catastrophe
Elementary agreement pension arose antiquity
Early association formed meet expense burial cremation
A small sum paid communal fund weekly basis upon death member fund would cover expense rite burial
These society sometimes sold share building burial vault owned precursor
Other early example mutual assurance pact traced back various form fellowship within Saxon clan England Germanic forebear Celtic society
However many earlier form surety aid would often fail due lack understanding knowledge
The century period advance mathematics Germany France England
At time rapidly growing desire need place valuation personal risk scientific basis
Independently studied emerged mathematical discipline
Another important advance came London named showed predictable pattern longevity death group people age despite uncertainty date death one individual
This study became basis original
One could set insurance scheme provide life insurance pension group people calculate degree accuracy much person group contribute common fund assumed earn fixed rate interest
The first person demonstrate publicly could done fame
Halley constructed life table showed could used calculate amount someone given age pay purchase life annuity
pioneering work long term insurance contract premium charged year led formation Society Equitable Assurances Lives Survivorship commonly known London
Many life insurance company pension fund created following year
Equitable Life first use word actuary chief executive officer
Previously actuary meant official recorded decision act ecclesiastical court
Other company use mathematical scientific method often failed forced adopt method pioneered Equitable
In century calculation course performed without computer
The calculation life insurance premium reserving requirement rather complex actuary developed technique make calculation easy possible example commutation function essentially precalculated column summation time discounted value survival death probability
Actuarial organization founded support actuary actuarial science protect public interest promoting competency ethical standard
However calculation remained cumbersome actuarial shortcut commonplace
actuary followed footstep life insurance colleague century
The revision based National Council Workmen Compensation Insurance rate took two month work day night team actuary pp

In mathematical foundation process developed
Actuaries could begin estimate loss using model random event instead method used past
The introduction development computer revolutionized actuarial profession
From punchcards current device modeling forecasting ability actuary rapidly improved still heavily dependent assumption input model actuary needed adjust new world pp

Traditional actuarial science modern US different practice caused different way calculating funding investment strategy different regulation
Regulations adoption cushioned market fluctuation FASB US Canada regulates pension valuation funding
Historically much foundation actuarial theory predated modern financial theory
In early twentieth century actuary developing many technique found modern financial theory various historical reason development achieve much recognition
As result actuarial science developed along different path becoming reliant assumption opposed concept used modern finance
The divergence related use historical data statistical projection liability cash flow instead caused manner traditional actuarial method apply market data number
For example one traditional actuarial method suggests changing mix investment change value liability asset changing assumption
This concept inconsistent
The potential modern financial economics theory complement existing actuarial science recognized actuary century pp

In late early distinct effort actuary combine financial theory stochastic method established model
Ideas financial economics became increasingly influential actuarial thinking actuarial science started embrace sophisticated mathematical modelling finance
Today profession practice educational syllabus many actuarial organization cognizant need reflect combined approach table loss model stochastic method financial theory pp

However concept still widely used setting discount rate assumption mentioned earlier particularly North America
Product design add another dimension debate
Financial economist argue pension benefit funded equity investment without reflecting risk achieving expected return
But pension product reflect risk unexpected return
In case pension beneficiary assumes risk employer assumes risk
The current debate seems focusing four principle Essentially financial economics state pension asset invested equity variety theoretical practical reason
There increasing trend recognize actuarial skill applied range application outside traditional field insurance pension etc
One notable example use US state actuarial model set criminal sentencing guideline
These model attempt predict chance according rating factor include type crime age educational background ethnicity offender
However model open criticism providing justification discrimination specific ethnic group law enforcement personnel
Whether statistically correct correlation remains debate
Another example use actuarial model ass risk sex offense recidivism
Actuarial model associated table SORAG used since late determine likelihood sex offender thus whether institutionalized set free pp

This chapter devoted present background knowledge available literature area research let reader know pro con already developed algorithm user localization
Earlier part chapter investigates background project attempting explain different localization scheme later part chapter focus different localization technique based Received Signal Strength final section give brief overview research presented area subject
It absolutely infeasible localization without knowledge physical world
Different technique using reference locate user developed many distance based angle based technique
There many technique mobile user localization powerful among offer higher accuracy le computation
Many method introduced indoor localization commonly used method based Radio Signal Strength RSS Time Arrival TOA
The positioning technique take account time taken signal arrive receiver called Time Arrival technique
Radio Signal Strength technique rely signal strength received receiver
Angle Arrival technique aim find angle transmitted signal receiver whose location identified
RSS TOA technique distance based technique depends upon Transmitter Receiver separation distance
On hand AOA technique based angle
Other technique take based area neighborhood
Localization procedure first step geographic area need identified target located next step involves locating target specific geographic area
First step trivial second step may complex depending upon accuracy precision requirement computational capability device geographic area
Localization algorithm designed taking account available resource accuracy precision requirement terrain geographic area characteristic
An algorithm may best particular situation may worse scenario algorithm absolutely favorable every situation
Many physical quantity signal depends upon distance characteristic received signal strength propagation time
Researchers field working find direct relation distance characteristic signal successful converting acquired physical quantity distance
This section devoted distance based localization technique time arrival TOA radio signal strength RSS time difference arrival TDOA
For acoustic signal known velocity propagation time directly converted distance covered
Main problem mechanism measure propagation time precision accuracy
system require high clock synchronization system component order beacon know exact time signal transmitted source quite difficult due hardware cost system limitation
Constrains Poor synchronization
Low SNR
Typical range estimation method may involve transmission wideband pseudo noise PN sequence subsequent correlation received signal sequence need high bandwidth better result
Several technique applied achieve better resolution without increasing signal BW
Like maximum likelihood delay estimation provide greeter delay resolution
TOA based technique characterized two main category propagation time estimation propagation time estimation
Propagation time signal known time lag transmission time transmitter receiving time receiver
Simply travel time signal transmitter receiving unit
Propagation delay Time Arrival mathematically described Here denotes propagation delay denotes signal arriving time signal transmission time
Assuming signal speed v separation calculated following relation
Using basic mechanism receiver must know transmission time arrived signal compute propagation delay
Time synchronization requirement exempted case combined transmission signal different speed like acoustic radio signal
propagation time estimation necessitate synchronization mechanism transmitting receiving node propagation delay computation demand
This synchronization mechanism avoided using round trip propagation time RTT
For RTT node account local time duration rather timestamps
RTT estimation two node labeled A B happens follows
Node A transmits data packet node Node B receives packet delay tdelay second reply node A form acknowledgement packet
The Node A determines RTT following relation Here show propagation time signal
Node B report tdelay Node A able calculate signal propagation time following relation This technique also face minimal error RTT calculation due clock drift node
Radio signal suffers different type distortion attenuation transmission cause Radio signal strength drop pass distance suffers attenuation
RSS based technique take benefit phenomenon understanding radio signal strength attenuation mandatory map radio signal strength distance
The idea behind using RSS technique localization problem demonstrate one one relationship received RSS separation distance
It important note RSS value distance always linear relationship particularly indoor environment different terrain characteristic
In indoor environment RSS level may drop due reflection many obstacle relating RSS level distance receiver would appear far distant place actual place
RSS level detection simple process require extra hardware require power detector already available almost wireless device like UWB Zigbee Bluetooth infrared device
So RSS measurement quite easy wireless network due already available hardware
It make technique favorable
The Ultra Wide Band UWB based technology offer better result based technology provide better accuracy
Although installation cost relatively high
Another positive factor RSS based technique need timing information turn require node synchronized property make technique robust multipath propagation effect
RSS based technique useful separation low area quite successful technique technique lack come accuracy offer le accurate localization TOA based system
Now looking side RSS based technique RSS system need trained require complex algorithm perform localization
RSS also sensitive sight propagation low Signal Noise Ratio shadowing
Shadowing reflection dealt random variable RSS linear parameter correctly characterize case shadowing reflection
For Wireless Sensor Network WSN advantageous use RSS technique localization continuous monitoring low cost capacity work year unattended
Although problem may caused due device operating GHz band interference increase probability error

In property relates number used algorithm
An algorithm must determine resource usage
Algorithmic efficiency thought analogous engineering repeating continuous process
For maximum efficiency wish minimize resource usage
However various resource
time space compared directly two algorithm considered efficient often depends measure efficiency considered important
requirement high speed minimum memory usage performance benchmark
The importance efficiency respect time emphasised applying mechanical analytical engine In almost every computation great variety arrangement succession process possible various consideration must influence selection amongst purpose calculating engine
One essential object choose arrangement shall tend reduce minimum time necessary completing calculation Early electronic computer severely limited speed operation amount memory available
In case realized whereby task could handled either using fast algorithm used quite lot working memory using slower algorithm used little working memory
The engineering use fastest algorithm would fit available memory
Modern computer significantly faster early computer much larger amount memory available Gigabytes instead Kilobytes
Nevertheless emphasised efficiency still important consideration In established engineering discipline improvement easily obtained never considered marginal I believe viewpoint prevail software engineering An algorithm considered efficient resource consumption computational cost acceptable level
Roughly speaking mean run reasonable amount time available computer
Since computer seen dramatic increase available computational power available amount memory current acceptable level would unacceptable even year ago
Computer manufacturer frequently bring new model often higher
Software cost quite high case simplest cheapest way getting higher performance might buy faster computer provided existing computer
There many way resource used algorithm measured two common measure speed memory usage measure could include transmission speed temporary disk usage disk usage power consumption response time external stimulus etc
Many measure depend size input algorithm
amount data processed might also depend way data arranged
sorting algorithm perform poorly data already sorted sorted reverse order
In practice factor affect efficiency algorithm requirement accuracy reliability
As detailed way algorithm implemented also significant effect actual efficiency though many aspect relate optimization issue
In theoretical analysis algorithm normal practice estimate complexity asymptotic sense
use represent complexity algorithm function size input
This generally sufficiently accurate large may misleading small value
bubble sort may faster quicksort item sorted
Some example Big O notation include For new version software provide comparison competitive system sometimes used assist gauging algorithm relative performance
If new algorithm produced example compared predecessor ensure least efficient known consideration functional improvement
Benchmarks used customer comparing various product alternative supplier estimate product best suit specific requirement term functionality performance
For example world certain proprietary product independent software company compete product major supplier speed
Some benchmark provide opportunity producing analysis comparing relative speed various compiled interpreted language example compare performance implementation typical programming problem several programming language
Even creating benchmark get least appreciation relative performance different programming language using variety user specified criterion quite simple produce Nine language Performance roundup Christopher demonstrates example Implementation issue also effect actual efficiency choice programming language way algorithm actually coded choice particular language compilation option used even operating system used
In case language implemented may much slower language implemented compiler
There factor may affect time space issue may outside programmer control include subroutine call
Some processor capability allow single instruction operate multiple operand may may easy programmer compiler use capability
Algorithms designed sequential processing may need completely redesigned make use
Another problem arise compatible processor may implement instruction different way instruction relatively fast model may relatively slow model make life difficult optimizing compiler
Measures normally expressed function size input
The two common measure For computer whose power supplied battery
calculation
measure interest In case le common measure may also relevant algorithm typically using analysis get estimate running time function size input data
The result normally expressed using
This useful comparing algorithm especially large amount data processed
More detailed estimate needed algorithm comparison amount data small though situation time le likely problem anyway
Algorithms include parallel processing may difficult analyse
Use benchmark time use algorithm
Many programming language available function provides CPU time usage
For algorithm elapsed time could also interest
Results generally averaged several test
This sort test sensitive hardware configuration possibility program task running time environment
This sort test also depends heavily selection particular programming language compiler compiler option algorithm compared must implemented condition
This section concerned use main memory often RAM algorithm carried
As time analysis algorithm typically using analysis get estimate memory needed function size input data
The result normally expressed using
There four aspect memory usage consider Early electronic computer early home computer relatively small amount working memory

maximum working memory word Sinclair came initially byte working memory
Current computer relatively large amount memory possibly Gigabytes squeeze algorithm confined amount memory much le problem used
But presence three different category memory significant An algorithm whose memory need fit cache memory much faster algorithm fit main memory turn much faster algorithm resort virtual memory
To complicate issue system three level cache memory varying effective speed
Different system different amount various type memory effect algorithm memory need vary greatly one system another
In early day electronic computing algorithm data would fit main memory algorithm could used
Nowadays use virtual memory appears provide lot memory cost performance
If algorithm data fit cache memory high speed obtained case minimising space also help minimise time
An algorithm fit completely cache memory exhibit may perform reasonably well
Software efficiency half every month compensating Moore Law In ubiquitous system halving instruction executed double battery life big data set bring big opportunity better software algorithm Reducing number operation N x N N x log N dramatic effect N large N billion change good year technology improvement

Software project notorius going past deadline going budget
The problem lie estimation amount effort required development project
The cost estimation usually dependent upon size estimate project may use line code function point metric see
There several different technique performing software cost estimation including expert judgement algorithmic model
Estimation expert judgement common way estimating effort required project
Unfortunately method estimation emphasize project life cycle important part project tracking allows estimate improved project life cycle
The quality cost estimation model much attributed initial estimate rather speed estimate converges actual cost project
COCOMO popular algorithmic model cost estimation whose cost factor tailored individual development environment important accuracy cost estimate
More one method cost estimation done comparison available estimate
This especially important unique project
Cost estimation must done diligently throughout project life cycle future fewer surprise unforseen delay release product
Studies within last year shown great deal money often spent project initially anticipated
IBM Consulting Group survey leading company found software developed cost initial cost estimate
The Standish Group also study project United States found software project completed cost original estimate
Although number year ago likely changed much recently
The problem making accurate cost estimate attributed number reason wrong cost estimation process may used process may used nature problem may allow accurate cost estimation
Cost estimation often overlooked project management practice
Cost estimation defined approximate judgement cost project
Cost estimation never exact science many variable involved calculation cost estimate human technical environmental political
Futhermore process involves significant human factor never exact human far complex entirely predictable
Furthermore software development project inevitably include number task complexity difficult judge complexity software system
Cost estimation usually measured term effort
The common metric used person month year man month year
The effort amount time one person work certain period time
It important specific characteristic development environment taking account comparing effort two project two development environment
A clear example difference development environment amount time people work different country typical workweek North America hour per week Europe typical workweek hour per week
Thus comparing project North America project Europe conversion factor would used accurate comparison
Different variable used cost estimation lead difficulty comparing project standard model tool used
For example cost estimate include factor management development training quality assurance area specific organization
Cost estimation important tool affect planning budgeting project
Because finite number resource project feature requirement document often included final product
A cost estimate done beginning project help determine feature included within resource constraint project time
Requirements prioritized ensure important feature included product
The risk project reduced important feature included beginning complexity project increase size mean opportunity mistake development progress
Thus cost estimation big impact life cycle schedule project
Cost estimation also important effect resource allocation
It prudent company allocate better resource experienced personnel costly project
Manpower loading term used measure number engineering management personnel allocated project given amount time
Most time worse company costly project fails le costly project fails
When tool used estimation management developer even experiment trading resource factor others keeping cost project constant
For example one tradeoff may invest powerful integrated development environment number personnel working project could reduced
Cost estimation large impact project planning management
Cost estimation done throughout entire life cycle
The first time cost estimation done beginning project requirement outlined
Cost estimation may even done beginning project
For example several company may bid contract based preliminary initial requirement company win bid second round estimation could done refined detailed requirement
Doing cost estimation entire life cycle allows refinement estimate data available
Periodic way gauge progress project whether deadline able met
Effective monitoring control software cost required verification improvement accuracy estimate
Tools available help organize manage cost estimate data captured development process
People le likely gather data process cumbersome tedious using tool efficient easy use save time
It always expensive tool best tool buy rather tool suited development environment
Some thought given level detail metric gathered well planning metric may used future comparison project
The metric gathered highly dependent upon organization development organizational practice
The success cost estimate method necessarily accuracy initial estimate rather rate estimate converge actual cost
An organization great deal contract work would place importance initial estimate
However general method better converges quickly actual cost project
At end project estimation method opportunity converge actual cost enough information available
The people cost estimate could either directly indirectly responsible implementation project developer manager respectively
Someone knowledge organization previous project could use approach compare current project previous project common method estimation small organization small project
The historical data often limited memory estimator
In case estimator would need experienced would likely company awhile
Some people believe better estimate done outsider le chance bias
It true people outside organization likely deal fewer company politics people within organization
For example developer company may want please manager give estimate
The disadvantage outside estimate person would le knowledge development environment especially person outside company
An empirical method estimation would required Constructive Cost Model COCOMO discussed detail
Empirical method estimation used type estimator
There may resistance using empirical method estimation may question whether model could outperform expert
People accurate estimator rare experience best get opinion several people tool
To give reader better idea software cost estimation fit development process outline general step cost estimation
The step numbered completely discrete one another
As well although generally follow logical order step fit several part development process
Although may first seem confusing step straightforward enough difficulty envisioning fit development process
The first important step establish cost estimate plan
In plan stated data gathered data gathered goal cost estimation process
Determining data gathered essentially stating level detail metric
This decision influence amount decomposition task
There obviously point gathering data used
This seem unnecessary require work people collect manage data
Although may seem like good idea gather metric used near future could possibly used future waste resource time
A fair amount thought put cost estimation plan much like requirement project
The second step perform cost estimation based requirement
Decomposition project done time lower level abstraction needed data
Keep mind important use one method estimation perfect technique
If wide variance estimate method information used make estimate
During lifecycle done allow refinement cost estimate
The could done major milestone project specific time interval
This decision depend situation
Changes may made project cost estimate either increase decrease
At end project final assessment result entire cost estimation process done
This allows company refine estimation process future data point obtained also allows developer review development process
In order understand end result output software cost estimation process must first understand software cost estimation process
By definition software cost estimation process set technique procedure used derive software cost estimate
There usually set input process process us input generate calculate set output
Most software cost estimation model view estimation process function computed set cost driver
And cost estimation technique primary cost driver important cost driver believed software requirement
As illustrated figure classical view software estimation process software requirement primary input process also form basis cost estimation
The cost estimate adjusted accordingly number cost driver arrive final estimate
So cost driver
Cost driver anything may affect cost software
Cost driver thing design methodology risk assessment personnel experience programming language system complexity
In classical view estimation process generate three output effort duration loading
The following brief description output The output loading duration effort usually computed fixed number without tolerance classical view
But reality cost estimation process complex shown figure
Many data input process modified refined software cost estimation process
In actual cost estimation process input constraint needed considered besides cost driver
One primary constraint software cost estimate financial constraint amount money budgeted allocated project
There constraint manpower constraint date constraint
Other input architecture defines component made system interrelationship component
Some company certain software process existing architecture place hence company software cost estimation must base estimate criterion
There case software requirement stay fixed
Hence deal software requirement change ambiguity inconsistency
During estimation process experienced estimator detect ambiguity inconsistency requirement
As part estimation process estimator try solve ambiguity modifying requirement
If ambiguity inconsistent requirement stay unsolved correspondingly affect estimation accuracy
The cost estimation accuracy help determine well accurate estimation using particular model technique
We ass performance software estimation technique Each error calculation technique advantage disadvantage
For example absolute error fails measure size project mean magnitude relative error mask systematic bias know estimation
This software cost estimation technique use mathematical equation perform software estimation
The mathematical equation based historical data theory
SLOC source line code function point cost driver input
For algorithmic model calibration specific software environment performed improve estimation
Examples parametric model COCOMO COnstructive COst MOdel COCOMO II Putnam software model SLIM
Advantages Disadvantages COCOMO stand Constructive Cost Model software cost estimation model first published Barry Bohem
It algorithmic approach estimating cost software project
By using COCOMO calculate amount effort time schedule project
From calculation find much staffing required complete project time
COCOMO main metric used calculating value line code denoted KLOC COCOMO II KDSI COCOMO measured thousand function point FP object point OP
There different version COCOMO two discussed report COCOMO COCOMO II
The equation COCOMO based also shown however real world use would likely use one free commercial COCOMO tool available
COCOMO doubt popular method software cost estimation
The estimation relatively easy hand
There also tool available allow calculate complex estimation
Calibration COCOMO one important thing need done order get accurate estimation
Even though COCOMO may popular estimation method recommended always use another method estimation verify result
The method differ significantly COCOMO
This way project examined one angle something may overlooked using COCOMO overlooked
Although estimation one common method estimation lightweight nature method suffers highly dependent upon competent estimator
On hand empirical estimation method use large database data point
COCOMO popular empirical estimation model incorporated several tool
Any model calibrated development environment development environment different
In end accurate estimate guaranteed using one method estimation recommended verification estimate

Both computer modelling simulation computer application represent real world imaginary system

Both computer modelling simulation help designer save time money

A simulation changing one variable model observing resulted change

Although model always try represent actual system simulation may try observe result impossible real world change

A model considered static simulation considered dynamic variable simulation get always changed

Ask following question With understanding usefulness standardized unit measurement student ready use unit measuring estimating measurement
In part lesson student measure piece paper toothpick
Each student size piece paper size toothpick
Depending level student could either distribute student sheet student work independently could guide student toothpick activity without student sheet
As student working toothpick measuring likely need problem solve paper space equal length toothpick
You help recognize using part toothpick might help solve problem
In tangible term student working whole number fraction
The student measure toothpick comfortable feel estimating toothpick To help student think estimation useful might ask Students work estimation exploring environment estimating size thing
For example ask go size They go search thing four toothpick long whatever size choose
Have make collection item actually measure comparison
Estimation concept incorporate everyday routine
At meeting time perhaps student estimate many child present head count
At time estimate long take class clean check timer
Perhaps meal time cooking activity student estimate much food ingredient fill bowl measure much
These kind simple question help student practice estimation skill
As way student reflect experienced measurement might fun write group story individually depending group happened Miss Viola Swamp measuring different sized candy bar
In contrast chaos produced help write happened began measuring kind candy bar
The story could end putting contrast simple complete sentence
Students could respond The difference using different sized candy bar sized candy bar
You also help student put toothpick measurement finding math sentence like My paper five whole toothpick part one toothpick Students could share result group setting help see since size piece paper used size toothpick result similar
You could help student may difficulty activity group sharing one feel embarrassed
To help student review practicing measurement estimation reinforce concept may applied ask following question These summarizing activity help student reflect upon helpful use standardized unit measurement using whole unit part unit whole number fraction help describe object estimation help describe object measurement somebody else even measuring tool available
By using question Measuring Toothpicks student sheet class problem student practice estimation skill
Have student work partner
One student pretend maker student owner book
With actual toothpick available owner describe estimate length width book maker
You use exercise short maker actually cut paper according understanding owner description
The idea help student begin see using unit measurement allows u estimate estimation help u give information another person
Students set incorporating estimation
They might enjoy using silly unconventional unit measurement
When student ready begin introducing conventional unit
You offer student conventional unit measurement ask consider tool would choose measuring length chalkboard chair pencil wall etc
Students need able measure tool accurately exercise help student begin see different measuring tool efficient easier use different object
For example using ruler measure pencil easier using yardstick using yardstick measuring floor easier using ruler
Also student begin recognize scale measure weight ruler measure inch
Although developmentally ready master concept volume help begin use appropriate labeling measurement
You model introduce measuring tool begin incorporate appropriate measurement wording experiment
Again may accurate measurement begin understand pencil six inch long ball weighs two pound

So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The began long modern discipline emerged century hinted century prior
The progression mechanical invention theory towards led major academic field basis massive worldwide industry

Many thousand computer employed commerce government research establishment
Most computer woman
Some performed astronomical calculation calendar others ballistic table military
After expression referred machine performed work human computer especially accordance effective method
The thesis state mathematical method effective could set list instruction able followed human clerk paper pencil long necessary without ingenuity insight
Machines computed continuous value became known kind
They used machinery represented continuous numeric quantity like angle shaft rotation difference electrical potential
Digital machinery contrast analog able render state numeric value store individual digit
Digital machinery used difference engine relay invention faster memory device
The phrase gradually gave way late onset electronic digital machinery became common
These computer able perform calculation performed previous human clerk
Since value stored digital machine bound physical property like analog device logical computer based digital equipment able anything could described purely mechanical
The theoretical created hypothetical device theorized order study property hardware
often regarded one first pioneer computing
Beginning Babbage vision mechanically computing number table
Putting reality Babbage designed calculator compute number decimal point long
Continuing success idea Babbage worked develop machine could compute number decimal place
By Babbage devised plan develop machine could use punched card perform arithmetical operation
The machine would store number memory unit would form sequential control
This mean one operation would carried another way machine would produce answer fail
This machine known Analytical Engine first true representation modern computer
Augusta Ada Byron credited pioneer computer programming regarded mathematical genius result mathematically heavy tutoring regimen mother assigned young girl
Lovelace began working Charles Babbage assistant Babbage working Analytical Engine first mechanical computer
During work Babbage Ada Lovelace became designer first computer algorithm ability compute
Moreover Lovelace work Babbage resulted prediction future computer perform mathematical calculation also manipulate symbol mathematical
While never able see result work Analytical Engine created lifetime effort later year beginning go unnoticed
The mathematical foundation modern computer science began laid
In theorem showed limit could proved disproved within
This led work Gödel others define describe formal system including concept
In Alan Turing independently also together introduced formalization limit computed purely mechanical model computing
This became hypothesis nature mechanical calculation device electronic computer
The thesis claim calculation possible performed algorithm running computer provided sufficient time storage space available
In also published seminal work abstract digital computing machine simply referred
This machine invented principle modern computer birthplace concept almost modern day computer use
These hypothetical machine designed formally determine mathematically computed taking account limitation computing ability
If Turing machine complete task considered Turing computable commonly Turing complete
The physicist described view fundamental importance Turing paper letter I know von Neumann well aware fundamental importance Turing paper Von Neumann introduced paper urging I studied care
Many people acclaimed von Neumann father computer modern sense term I sure would never made mistake
He might well called midwife perhaps firmly emphasized others I sure fundamental conception owing Turing Up electrical engineer able build electronic circuit solve mathematical logic problem manner lacking theoretical rigor
This changed engineer Akira Nakashima
From Nakashima published series paper showing discovered independently unaware work describe operation switching circuit
This concept utilizing property electrical switch logic basic concept underlies electronic
Switching circuit theory provided mathematical foundation tool design almost area modern technology
Nakashima work later cited elaborated seminal master thesis
While taking undergraduate philosophy class Shannon exposed work recognized could used arrange electromechanical relay used telephone routing switch solve logic problem
His thesis became foundation practical digital circuit design became widely known among electrical engineering community World War II

The first actual computer bug
It stuck relay Harvard Mark II
While invention term often erroneously attributed future rear admiral Navy supposedly logged bug September account conflict least detail
According account actual date September operator filed along insect notation First actual case bug found see detail
In model computer architecture introduced became known
Since von Neumann model provided uniformity subsequent computer design
The von Neumann architecture considered innovative introduced idea allowing machine instruction data share memory space
The von Neumann model composed three major part arithmetic logic unit ALU memory instruction processing unit IPU
In von Neumann machine design IPU pass address memory memory turn routed either back IPU instruction fetched ALU data fetched
Von Neumann machine design us RISC Reduced instruction set computing architecture mean instruction set us total instruction perform task
This contrast CISC instruction set instruction choose
With von Neumann architecture main memory along accumulator register hold result logical operation two memory addressed
Operations carried simple arithmetic performed ALU include addition subtraction multiplication division conditional branch commonly seen statement loop
The branch serve statement logical move different component machine move accumulator memory vice versa
Von Neumann architecture accepts fraction instruction data type
Finally von Neumann architecture simple one register management also simple
The architecture us set seven register manipulate interpret fetched data instruction
These register include IR instruction register IBR instruction buffer register MQ multiplier quotient register MAR memory address register MDR memory data register
The architecture also us program counter PC keep track program machine

But Ghz referring
This referring
The clock computer clock wall used tell time
A computer clock like metronome keep beat musician play music
A clock change value every period
We use letter designate period
This signal repeat
Perhaps remember course calculus sine wave
This wave repeat per period
The difference sine wave clock sine wave curved
It gradually increase decrease
A clock signal squarish shape
Related period clock
Frequency defined unit
When hear clock rate usually given frequency
Thus Ghz mean cycle per second
A signal single period
The period clock second half nanosecond really really short period time
To give idea short time
Imagine everyone world sang exactly one note exactly one person sings time
Suppose note last one nanosecond
It would take second complete assuming billion people world
As see clock signal positive slope negative slope
This slope exaggerated see better
Normally would quite angled
There key feature clock Each positive clock edge appears per clock period
Each negative clock edge appears per clock period
Must clock always
The answer
We could clock stay three quarter period one quarter period fraction
If using positive edge matter long signal stay since use edge
However want use positive negative edge going consider want edge occur
Begin move finger right trace signal
Your finger move back
If happen trace positive edge second steadily moving right going faster slower period second frequency Hz
Tracing signal hand give better feel continuous signal behaves
Usually computer science major difficult time unless really like calculus engineering deal quantity discrete rather continuous
At point time someone ask current value signal
If use pipe analogy think signal alternating pumping red soda green soda
To give analogy imagine music conductor tapping beat baton stick regular interval
Suppose playing piano told play new note time tap baton
Thus fast conductor tap baton control often play note
Similarly rate positive clock edge appears control fast sequential logic device change output
It turn using clock design CPU easily use clock
This primary reason use clock

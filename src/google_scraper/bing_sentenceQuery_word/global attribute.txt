In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
Get FREE access day create account
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

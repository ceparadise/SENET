A basic unit used computer science
Nodes device data point larger network
Devices personal computer cell phone printer node
When defining node internet node anything
Nodes individual part larger data structure
Nodes contain also may link node
Links node often implemented
Nodes often arranged tree structure
These structure
A node represents information contained single structure
These node may contain value condition possibly serve another independent data structure
Nodes represented single parent node
The highest point tree structure called root node parent node serf parent node tree
The height node determined total number edge path node furthest leaf node height tree equal height root node
Node depth determined distance particular node root node
The root node said depth zero
Data discovered along network path
An IP address us kind system node define location network
Another common use node tree
In programming used communicate information computer programmer computer alike
For reason XML used create common used serf base development modern web like
Though similar approached programmer typically language used develop website text design
While XML HTML XHTML provide language expression serf translator
Different type node tree represented specific interface
In word node type defined communicates node
Each node node type property specifies type node sibling leaf
For example node type property constant property node property specifies type node
So node type property constant node one know node object object Element
This object us Element interface define method property particular node
Node Types Different node type description A node object represented single node tree
It element node attribute node text node type described section node type
All object inherit property method dealing parent child node object parent child node
For example text node child node similar node add child node result error
Objects DOM tree may addressed manipulated using method object
The public interface DOM specified API
The history Document Object Model intertwined history late well first widely implemented

I trying find max number node tree defined follows The root child
Each subtree left L child
Each subtree right R child
I know formula finding number node binary tree n n amount level tree
Anyone better math help figure
As I understand looking formula maximal number node
Let n number level child root
Assume smaller trivial
On left node L child L child L child long leaf L L second tier
So left node
It easy calculate using information
n L Similarly node right
And include root receive formula

Does anybody know would I approach calculating maximum number child node node exactly child binary tree n node
Please give actual answer one homework problem I would like solve I simply know start
Any help apreciated
Try construct tree lot node
Start root
Let say root exactly one child
Let say child exactly one child etc
So tree n node arrange one single child
This mean maximum least course n
Finally prove maximum n least one leaf node
I think maximum tree given depth little interesting
What maximum number node cram binary tree depth n
For depth single leaf maximum
For depth enumeration show maximum
More generally tree shape maximizes number node

How n maximum possible number node height h binary search tree heap tree
I saw proof asymptotically bound function book I get
I actually touched upon response previous general idea n node binary tree starting root depth maximum node
We see greatest depth half node
Remember height node distance node leaf height leaf height root height tree
So leaf n
For root n n
And rest tree follows
I think support maximum number node particular height
A full binary tree sometimes proper binary tree strictly binary tree tree every node leaf two child
At successive level number node would

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

The big advantage list sentence ability represent data mean sublists
In chapter look example use list sublists represent information structure
The kind structure consider called resemble tree nature The component tree called At top tree interior diagram bottom branch extend
We going begin considering tree abstract data type without thinking list used represent tree
For example construct tree using procedure named Scheme primitive
About halfway chapter explore relationship tree list
Here tree represents world Each node tree represents region world
Consider node labeled Great Britain
There two part node The obvious part label name Great Britain
But region world included within Great node attached beneath Great Britain also part node
We say every node zero For moment let say datum either word sentence
The child tree
Notice definition tree made tree
What base case
This family metaphor also part terminology tree
We say node another node two node In advanced treatment even hear thing like grandparent cousin wo get
What happens prune actual tree cutting branch
The part essentially tree smaller trunk fewer branch
The metaphor perfect part root still stick end ground hope end take root new tree
It country example country branch node entire world tree also tree
Depending think Great Britain either component entire world collection smaller location
So branch node represents Great Britain root node entire tree
What node
It might seem natural think node information one circle think node including datum
In way thinking node would separate every node word sentence separate element
However useful think node structure includes everything circle also datum child
So think node Great Britain thinking name Great Britain also everything Great Britain
From perspective root node tree includes entire tree
We might well say node tree
The constructor tree actually constructor one node root node
Our constructor tree therefore called
It take two argument datum possibly empty list child
As following example show constructing think one tree requires construction many node
You notice defined place shown figure
That got tired typing going invent abbreviation later
For take time show selector tree
tree node return datum node
node return list child node
A list tree called Here abbreviation help u construct world tree le typing
Unlike intended work tree general abbreviation designed world tree specifically mind With abbreviation world tree somewhat easier define Now tree many city world
At first glance may seem like simple case recursion calling
But since look like single recursive call really call equivalent recursive call one child given tree node
Note call call
This pattern called Mutual recursion often useful technique dealing tree
In typical recursion seen chapter moved sequentially list sentence recursive call taking u one step right
In following paragraph present three different model help think shape tree give rise mutual recursion
In first model going think initialization procedure helper procedure
Suppose want count leaf tree
Unless argument shallow tree involve counting leaf child tree
What want straightforward sequential recursion list child
But given wrong argument tree list child
So need initialization procedure whose job extract list child invoke helper procedure list argument
The helper procedure follows usual sequential list pattern Do something list recursively handle list
Now
In usual sequential recursion list something simple word
What special tree tree like entire data structure started
Therefore must invoke procedure whose domain tree
This model built two idea
One idea domain function reason need two procedure need one take tree argument one take list tree argument
The idea leap faith assume invocation within correctly handle child without tracing exact sequence event
The second model easier state le rigorous
Because nature tree order visit every node able move two different direction
From given node able move child child must able move next sibling
The job move left right list child
It using familiar kind recursion invokes directly
The downward motion happens move one level invoking
How program move one level
At level invoked recursively
The third model also based nature tree
Imagine moment node tree one child
In case could move root single leaf structure similar actual procedure carrying sequential recursion The trouble course downward step single next node
Instead single path root leaf multiple path root many leaf
To make idea downward motion sequential recursion work real tree level must clone many time child
factory manufacture clone
It hire one little person child accumulates result
The key point recursion tree child tree perfectly good tree
This recursiveness nature tree give rise recursive structure program use tree
The reason say recursive invocation cause one several recursive invocation one child way
In fact use name situation procedure invocation result one recursive call even argument tree
The computation Fibonacci number Chapter example tree recursion tree
The recursion Chapter also tree recursion structured somewhat character even though use formal mechanism exploring chapter
The recursion horizontal one moving one element another within list recursion vertical one exploring sublist given list
Procedures explore tree always simple
We started example could write using function understand structure problem take complexity mutual recursion
But many tree problem quite fit function
For example let write predicate take name place tree argument tell whether place tree
It possible make work This awkward construction however also performs unnecessary computation
If place looking happens first child node nevertheless look child well
We better replacing use mutual recursion Although mutual recursion little tricky read structure program fit way describe algorithm English
A place tree one two condition hold place datum root tree place recursively one child tree tree
That say
As say place one group tree place first tree one remaining tree
Our next project similar previous one little intricate
We like able locate city find larger region enclose city
For example want say Instead getting answer whether city tree want find
The algorithm recursive To look Berkeley within world need able look Berkeley within subtree
The node several child country
recursively asks child find path Berkeley
All one child return ca find Berkeley within territory
But node return To make complete path prepend name current node path
What happens try look Berkeley Australia
Since Australia child return path Berkeley Australia return
Compare structure
The helper procedure almost identical
The main procedure look different harder job check two possibility The city might datum argument node might belong one child tree
We done lot tree yet talked way Scheme store tree internally
How work
It turn convenient represent tree term list
In word tree list whose first element datum whose remaining element subtrees
Ordinarily however going print tree entirety
As example extract subset information put readable form
The procedure define abstract data type tree
Using ADT able write several useful procedure manipulate tree pinning exactly tree represented Scheme list
Although would possible refer part node using directly program readable use selector constructor
Consider example What mean context
Is tree datum
A child
A forest
Of course could work careful reasoning form presented example originally much clearer Even better would Using appropriate selector constructor called data abstraction
Failing use appropriate selector constructor called Since wrote selector constructor tree could defined use different representation You might expect change representation would require change procedure wrote earlier
But fact procedure would continue work perfectly see representation
They respect data abstraction
As long find right information matter tree stored
All matter constructor selector compatible
On hand example section violated data abstraction using find second child would fail changed representation
Many case like one formerly working program failed change representation led programmer use moralistic term respecting violating data abstraction
Consider notation arithmetic expression
Scheme us notation
By contrast people Scheme programmer generally represent arithmetic computation using notation function symbol go two argument
Our goal section translate infix arithmetic expression tree representing computation
This translation process called expression
For example turn expression tree The point using tree going easy perform computation tree form
In original infix form hard know first rule determine implicit grouping Multiplication division come addition subtraction operation precedence done left right
Our sample expression equivalent In tree representation easy see operation nearer leaf done first root node last operation depends result operation
Our program take argument infix arithmetic expression form list Each element list must one three thing number one four symbol sublist list example satisfying rule
You imagine implementing pocket calculator
If implementing computer programming language also accept variable name operand
But bothering complication really affect part problem turning expression tree
What make problem tricky ca put list element tree soon see
For example first three element sample list
It tempting build subtree three element But compare picture earlier picture correct tree see second argument invocation number rather subexpression
By reasoning might think examine entire expression start building tree
But fact sometimes build subtree confidence
For example see minus sign sample expression tell subexpression come complete higher precedence
Here plan
The program examine argument left right
Since program ca finish processing list element right away maintain information element examined entirely processed
It going easier maintain information two part one list operation another operand
Here first step parsing sample expression program examines element argument putting number onto operand list operation symbol onto operation list At point program looking operator infix expression
If newly seen operator lower precedence already head list operation would time carry operation creating tree root first two operand list child
Instead since higher precedence program ready create subtree must instead add operation list
This time newly seen operation lower precedence head operation list
Therefore time program operator making subtree containing operator first two element operand list
This new subtree becomes new first element operand list
Because program decided handle waiting operator still moved operator infix expression operator list
Now program must compare head list
These two operator precedence
Since want carry operator left right time handle operator
Finally program move operator onto operator list
The next several step similar one already seen
This new situation The first unseen element infix expression neither number operator sublist
We recursively subexpression adding resulting tree operand list
Then proceed processing higher precedence priority
Once program examined every element infix expression operator remaining operator list must handled
In case one operator
Once operator handled one element remaining operand list element desired tree entire original expression
The following program implement algorithm
It work correctly formed infix expression given argument like give incorrect result Scheme error
We promised building tree would easy compute value expression
Here program A leaf node perfectly good actual argument tree procedure even though picture leaf node look treeish branch
A common mistake make base case recursion node whose child leaf instead node leaf
The value returned tree forest
therefore suitable actual argument procedure expects tree
What mean printout
Why two set parenthesis
Suppose change definition tree constructor us instead How change selector everything still work
Write procedure take tree argument return largest number node connected link
That leaf node depth tree child root node leaf depth
Our world tree depth longest path root leaf example world country state city
Write procedure take tree argument return total number node tree
Earlier counted number node
Write procedure take tree argument return copy tree leaf node original tree removed
If argument tree root node child return result removing root node would tree
Write program par Scheme arithmetic expression kind tree produce infix expression
Assume procedure invocation Scheme expression two argument
The resulting tree valid argument You solve problem without restriction invocation rewrite assume every branch node two child
You probably think tree short tall
But since tree convention call shallow deep
Another example data abstraction violation Chapter
When creates empty database use constructor
Instead merely used quoted empty sentence Actually see shortly element operand list tree put operand list tree whose datum number

One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Get FREE access day create account
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

I looking appropriate term call proposal
I knew either platform architecture
But could simply clearly distinguish academic manner
So I searched web literature found definition architecture platform follows sound logical
However still clear difference
I guess researcher often use two term interchangeably marginal consideration differentiation
Looking definition I figured architecture likely specifies structural property system usually try describe structure system consisting component relationship
Using architecture developer produce system work according architecture
However platform trying specify structural behavioural attribute system describing subsystem relationship
Platform also provides abstract developer create new software system rely upon platform
Is interpretation accurate enough
One may argue platform prepared top architecture without architecture one may able propose platform
In idea else difference distinguishing line two term
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Architecture generally refers structure organization entire system
Platform generally refers something operating system library programming language programming environment build thing
Disclaimer The folowing answer opinion
It necceseraly true
Sorry bad english
When say architecture primarily mean computer architecture address bit memory define command processor
Examples macro definition window architecture Yes platform architecture marginally used interchangeably When say platform mean computer platfrom deal system software eg
operating system
Examples macro definition window platform So architecture lower level concept platform
On top architecture implement platform eg
POSIX
And top platform build application

In iOS application I heavy weight migration Entity I convert type attribute old data model type String new data model
The conversion attribute appears working fine
However problem I run another attribute Entity null supposed attribute migrated entity new schema error flagged I sure error flagged attribute marked optional data model
I would like simply migrate nil value attribute attribute new data model without change modification
Here relevant code subclass NSEntityMigrationPolicy I using Can anyone see I wrong
Thanks advance reply
The issue getting back class dictionary mean trying pas wrong type class new instance
If read documentation see value represented instance
Which problem
Personally I would approach value way
Instead I would something like Whereby grabbing value directly object get proper back

I data set almost data NA
Out column categorical rest target variable categorical variable
I want find important attribute build model
I would like add class biasness attribute
Can please suggest feasible solution problem
My sample dataset look like please model work well data NA
How bias handled
How find attribute importance
target variable column g
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
Attribute importance found several way
Personally I prefer In case look like Here result From result seems feature strongest predictive power feature weakest
From package try method well
But give character vector containing chosen attribute Also check Which model use classification task hard tell
The theorem machine learning state one model work best every problem
You try different model see one best
I suggest start package try many classification supported
Here one interesting document give suggestion classification algorithm focus There many way get variable importance really depends define strict
Do want create best possible model get importance metric one variable
You find lot model give importance metric
Like
You find importance metric using package tree model command
You might use standardised coefficient linear regression model
Those approach likely give slightly different result wiser chose method best fit data
You need experiment order pick best model also pick threshold say important variable
Does mean top top something else
In term NAs think NA mean missing value something meaningful replace number value
I afraid variable lot NAs lose term importance

The original flow chart referring appropriate sequential programming
Computer science dispensed flowchart taken new level
Nowadays use called case diagram target object oriented programming
These diagram display class object method relate
This still use iterative programming
It expected programmer would kind thing head
When I began computer programming taught use structure chart model process decision flow sequence program
This resembled typical flow chart decision point conditional branch
When I entered real world computer programming I discovered majority programmer use formal flowchart organize program logic
They le head although fact I think internalized process became second nature
Still I believe flow chart useful tool introductory course computer science
Organizational structure chart obviously seem like great idea use explain thing people outside certain field example corporate structure chart department structure chart bring mind fact many company people sort background experience payroll accommodate plan
I think chart great way company get everyone page
One editor review suggestion make change warranted

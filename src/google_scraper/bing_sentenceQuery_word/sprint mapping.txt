Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
With User Story Mapping If start sprint MVP definition story must
In fixed without shoulds coulds hit target estimated velocity slip
Usually scrum feature delivered sprint would mix must shoulds coulds allowing leeway PM de scope story keep
I would look Story Map probability distribution
If team decrease velocity one sprint still room increase next one deliver MVP total meeting deadline
So first thing pretend MoSCoW plan work velocity given commitment fixed end date better deliver meet requirement
Once going ca descope need thing
Look team plan early get extra resource ideally need people inside ramp screen carefully bringing plus need think early extra hour help better death march last month
Also need pare work bone
Agile YAGNI etc I mean everything preemptive design refactoring test coverage etc
The MVP MINIMUM need
raise story something need revisited later make sure agree PO spend percentage time MVP making money clean
And unpalatable need remember something slip sacrificing quality controlled way fix later better team cutting corner fly meet deadline

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
This first Agile project plan Sprint consist Release Content Planning Defining Product Backlog Product Backlog Grooming Breakup EPICs story much possible point time High Level Design Environment Setup Develop critical story basic framework place Please let know need anything else suggest duration sprint Sprint part official
It arisen unnoficial approach kickstarting Scrum organisation
All needed start Scrum development team Scrum Master Product Owner backlog cover least sprint worth work
So might regard formation team refinement backlog cover least one sprint worth story
With rapid starting approach team would need thing like environment setup within first sprint
The development team often make clear Product Owner lot business value delivered first sprint
The alternative longer sprint pack lot setup preparation work
The danger approach bit waterfall
With sprint replacing project phase waterfall project
I big fan sprint I seen used lot
To answer original question thing crop sprint As stated Sprint Zero
However plenty done beginning utilize Scrum framework help create productivity success
The shock approach successful high risk lot debt occur much software produced first several Sprints

I see term come often programming reading
The current book I reading Programming C Stephen Koching used time throughout book
One example chapter looping say When developing program sometimes becomes desirable test made end loop rather beginning
Naturally C language provides special language handle situation
This looping statement known statement
In case term mean word relation object language
In case replace word
word relation object language
No
These two term different
There nothing like constructor C It generic term normally refers particular syntax included language perform task like loop condition end
It relation constructor
word relation object language
The sentence us noun verb meaning word construct something idea theory formed people mind
In case construct refers abstract way describing something namely loop term syntax particular language
Language construct mean way something language
A simply concept implementation mechanism used given programming language language syntax
In case concept loop construct manner implemented C programming language
Programming language provide construct various programming concept define programming concept implemented language
Does word relation object language
The two term different constructor used Object Oriented Languages java available C programming language

Serial mean one event time
It usually contrasted meaning one event happening time
In data transmission technique time division space division used time separate transmission individual bit information sent serially space multiple line path used multiple bit sent parallel
In context computer hardware data transmission serial connection operation medium usually indicate simpler slower operation parallel indicates faster operation
This indication always hold since serial medium example fiber optic cable much faster slower medium carry multiple signal parallel
On PC printer usually attached parallel interface cable print faster
Your keyboard mouse device require serial interface line

In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

I learning C
Though author careful beginning confuse student jargon occasionally used term without explaining meaning
I figured meaning many term help internet
However I could understand exactly meaning phrase construct unfortunately web provide good explanation
Considering I beginner construct mean
First need understand
All programming language constructed language read reference
You may read little bit including well
Going back question consider The English language natural language token use build use build sentence word
So English language construct build token
Consider example Imagine set build house basic material might use sand iron wood cement water four simplicity
Anything build item would CONSTRUCT turn help build house
I intentionally omitted detail simplify answer hope helpful
A language construct piece language syntax
For example following language construct C let control flow program They usually use term part programming language may written differently depending language
For example similar language construct would The function construct however way written bit different
Hope help
If need detail may want bit research
As one comment suggests Wikipedia may helpful
Without seeing context phrase used I sure generally phrase construct mean combination keywords grammar structure coding language
Basically piece code
definition A language construct syntactically allowable part program may formed one lexical token accordance rule programming language
The term Language Constructs often used synonym control structure confused function
They base unit language built
They ca used function rollback
They directly called parser
It includes syntax semantics coding style language
For clarification may refer
Let say want create class containing method property Construct architecture class create
The architecture class consists method property created using predefined utility etc That take construct
In reference programming language C structural language compiling code everything thing go statement statement
Thus becomes necessary place statement properly
This placing
putting statement correctly language construct else may syntax error logical error

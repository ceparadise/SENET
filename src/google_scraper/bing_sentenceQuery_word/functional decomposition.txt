In mathematics process resolving relationship constituent part way original function reconstructed recomposed part
This process decomposition may undertaken gain insight identity constituent component may reflect individual physical process interest
Also functional decomposition may result compressed representation global function task feasible constituent process posse certain level independence
Interactions component critical function collection
All interaction may observable possibly deduced repetitive perception synthesis validation verification composite behavior
For multivariate function functional decomposition generally refers process identifying set function function
Thus would say function decomposed function
This process intrinsically hierarchical sense often seek decompose function collection constituent function function
Decompositions kind interesting important wide variety reason
In general functional decomposition worthwhile certain sparseness dependency structure constituent function found depend approximately variable
Thus example obtain decomposition hierarchical composition function shown figure right would probably considered highly valuable decomposition
A basic example functional decomposition expressing four binary arithmetic operation addition subtraction multiplication division term two binary operation addition multiplication two unary operation additive inversion multiplicative inversion Subtraction realized composition addition additive inversion division realized composition multiplication multiplicative inverse This simplifies analysis subtraction division also make easier axiomatize operation notion two binary two unary operation rather four binary operation
As decomposition valuable reason twofold
Firstly decomposition function component generally permit economical representation function
For example set quaternary variable representing full function requires storing value value function element possible combination
However decomposition given possible requires storing value requires storing value requires storing value
So virtue decomposition need store value rather value dramatic saving
Intuitively reduction representation size achieved simply variable depends subset variable
Thus variable depends directly variable rather depending variable
We would say variable variable rest world
Practical example phenomenon surround u discussed Philosophical Considerations let consider particular case northbound traffic
Let u assume variable take three possible value moving slow moving deadly slow moving
Now let say variable depends two variable weather value sun rain snow traffic value
The point certainly many secondary variable affect weather variable low pressure system Canada Japan etc
Bridge traffic variable accident presidential motorcade etc
secondary variable directly relevant West Side Highway traffic
All need hypothetically order predict West Side Highway traffic weather GW Bridge traffic two variable West Side Highway traffic potential influence
That influence act
Outside purely mathematical consideration perhaps greatest value functional decomposition insight provides structure world
When functional decomposition achieved provides ontological information structure actually exist world predicted manipulated
For example illustration learned depends directly mean purpose prediction suffices know
Moreover intervention influence taken directly nothing additional gained intervening variable since act case
The philosophical antecedent ramification functional decomposition quite broad functional decomposition one guise another underlies modern science
Here review philosophical consideration
One major distinction often drawn Eastern philosopher tended espouse idea favoring Western thinker tended espouse idea favoring
This distinction East West akin philosophical distinction
Some example Eastern holistic spirit The Western tradition origin among preferred position drawing correct distinction division contrast considered pinnacle insight
In worldview able distinguish via strict proof quality thing represent virtue formal description segregate entity proper place taxonomy nature achieve height wisdom
In natural artificial system require component integrated fashion number component exceeds could reasonably fully interconnected due square wise growth number connection n two n n one often find degree hierarchicality must employed solution
The general advantage sparse hierarchical system densely connected quantitative estimate presented
In prosaic term hierarchy collection element combine lawfully complex whole depend property upon constituent part wherein novelty fundamentally combinatorial iterative transparent
An important notion always arises connection hierarchy modularity effectively implied sparseness connection hierarchical topology
In physical system module generally set interacting component relates external world via limited interface thus concealing aspect internal structure
As result modification made internals module improve efficiency example necessarily create ripple effect rest system
This feature make effective use modularity centerpiece good software hardware engineering
There many compelling argument regarding prevalence necessity nature
point among evolving system manage obtain reuse stable subassemblies module likely able search fitness landscape reasonably quick pace thus Simon submits among possible complex form hierarchy one time evolve
This line thinking led even stronger claim although know form life evolved planet universe safely assume life must hierarchically organized
This would fortunate state affair since existence simple isolable subsystem thought precondition successful science
In case experience certainly seems indicate much world posse hierarchical structure
It proposed perception process hierarchical decomposition phenomenon essentially hierarchical nature may even theoretically intelligible human mind
In Simon word The fact many complex system nearly decomposable hierarchic structure major facilitating factor enabling u understand describe even see system part
Or perhaps proposition put way round
If important system world complex without hierarchic may considerable extent escape observation understanding
Analysis behavior would involve detailed knowledge calculation interaction elementary part would beyond capacity memory computation
Practical application functional decomposition found
Processes related functional decomposition prevalent throughout field
Hierarchical model induction technique example function decomposition
A review application function decomposition found also present method based
Many statistical inference method thought implementing function decomposition process presence noise functional dependency expected hold
Among model recently popular method referred causal decomposition
See
In practical scientific application almost never possible achieve perfect functional decomposition incredible complexity system study
This complexity manifested presence noise designation unwanted untraceable influence observation
However perfect functional decomposition usually impossible spirit life large number statistical method equipped deal noisy system
When natural artificial system intrinsically hierarchical system variable provide evidence hierarchical structure
The task observer seek understand system infer hierarchical structure observation variable
This notion behind hierarchical decomposition joint distribution attempt recover something intrinsic hierarchical structure generated joint distribution
As example method attempt decompose joint distribution along causal fault line thus cutting nature seam
The essential motivation behind method within system natural artificial relatively interact one another directly equal footing
Rather one observes pocket dense connection direct interaction among small subset component loose connection densely connected subset
There thus notion causal proximity physical system variable naturally precipitate small cluster
Identifying cluster using represent joint provides basis great efficiency storage relative full joint distribution well potent inference algorithm
Functional Decomposition design method intending produce architectural description computer program
Rather conjecturing Objects adding method Object intending capture service program software architect first establishes series function type accomplishes main processing problem computer program decomposes reveal common function type finally derives Modules activity
For example design editor initially thought term function And possible This lead one plausible Module Service Object interpreter containing function
Function Decomposition arguably yield insight course analysis two function produce type likely common resides
To contrast common practice conjecture Modules prior considering decomposition
This arguably result costly later
FD mitigates risk extent
Further arguably separate FD design provides concise medium architectural discourse revealing flaw upstream beneficially exposing design decision advance
And lastly FD known prioritize development
As arguably FD correct part program identified far earlier development cycle
Functional decomposition used analysis many system
The input signal LTI system expressed function
Then decomposed linear combination function called component signal Here component signal
Note constant
This decomposition aid analysis output system expressed term component input
If let represent effect system output signal expressed In word system seen acting separately component input signal
Commonly used example type decomposition
Functional decomposition refers process defining system functional term defining function sequencing relationship higher level system function
The basic idea try divide system way block described without description
This exercise force part system pure
When system designed pure function reused replaced
A usual side effect interface block become simple generic
Since interface usually become simple easier replace pure function related similar function
For example say one need make system
One might functionally decompose front panel
Later different model need audio probably fit interface

Functional Decomposition useful
Where worked example used
Functional Decomposition process taking complex process breaking smaller simpler part
For instance think using ATM
You could decompose process Walk ATM Insert bank card Enter pin well get point
You think programming way
Think software running ATM Code reading card PIN verification Transfer Processing Each broken
Once reached decomposed piece subsystem think start coding piece
You compose small part greater whole
Check Wikipedia Article The benefit functional decomposition start coding working simplest component possibly work application
Therefore developing testing component becomes much easier mention better able architect code project fit need
The obvious downside time investment
To perform functional decomposition complex system take trivial amount time BEFORE coding begin
Personally I think amount time well worth
It WorkBreakDown Structures WBS mindMapping top development basically breaking large problem smaller comprehensible
Pros Cons real CONS decomposition however common mistake Functional decomposition way breaking complex problem simpler problem based task need performed rather data relationship
This term usually associated older design
Here example C compiler
First preprocessor handle macro
You give file name option return really long string
Let call function
Then lexical analyzer
It take string break token
Call
The parser take token turn tree call
Then function converting tree DAG block call
Call code emitter take DAG block spit assembler
The compiler We decomposed big difficult understand function function bunch smaller easier understand function
You pipeline could write program This typical compiler fairly deep program program broad comparison
Functional decomposition helpful prior creating functional requirement document
If need software something functional decomposition answer question What function software must provide
Decomposing needed define function
I need software energy efficiency measurement general
That break smaller piece point clearly understand function system need provide
This later used checklist completeness system
A functional requirement document FD basically textual representation functional decomposition
Coding directly FD may ok procedural language good enough solution identify object
Neither good usability planning testing
My opinion take time create FD use much time
Consult every person know process following system find function needed
I lot experience software design development selling I use functional decomposition first step development
I use base contract client know get I know I must provide

This similar number Business Analysis technique including Organizational Analysis Feature Tree Work Breakdown Structures Mind Mapping
The key difference decomposition analysis technique child something decomposed completely describe component parent decomposed
This may true something like Org Chart may show
Koopman describes three basic type decomposition described Structures physical component logical object attribute field arrangement structure within design
Structures typically answer question design typically described using noun adjective
For business analyst structural decomposition likely take following form Behaviors action force process control exerted structure respect structure external environment
In case portion design consideration constitute portion external environment behavior consideration
Behaviors typically answer question design typically described using verb adverb
For business analyst take form Functional Decomposition business function action question
Functional Decomposition type Decomposition described many Business Analysis reference one core business analysis technique according IIBA
It also good idea know Functional Decomposition exists discipline although often done different way
It exists mathematics decomposing formula mathematical problem signal processing machine learning database theory knowledge representation software development system engineering
Just aware refer functional decomposition others may different understanding exactly done sure clarify
Goals emergent property satisfy need effort design intended fulfill
Goals include result directly available building block
Goals thus include performance target cost aesthetic
For business analyst goal decomposition include The concept Cohesion Coupling key well executed functional decomposition
However also applied structural goal decomposition well
Cohesion simply measure similar function group
The greater cohesion two function likely grouped together decomposition result
This help ensure similar function grouped together help identify potential duplicate function may performed different group different step sequence
If function several thing low cohesion good chance function need analysis may need broken several discreet function level current function
Coupling measure interdependence two function
So change function function group low coupling would affect function outside function group
The measure good decomposition effort high cohesion high coupling within low cohesion low coupling
Decomposition lot us
It used Examples decomposition might used include The following step show general process Business Analyst go order conduct Functional Decomposition
Different documentation type shown afterwards
Decide decomposition effort
This usually involves making following three decision Work customer SME appropriate identify main component within focus area
Review main function identify within
Review identified component determine need decomposition
Check completeness
Are aspect entity review captured represented
Are component correctly organized discreetly related group
Is decomposition needed
Repeat Refine result business project team member satisfied completeness level detail
If desired component documented consistent way component In addition difference functionally decomposed different way document result decomposition analysis different level detail used
The different method documentation include The following simple example documentation type using idea functional breakdown window typical fast food restaurant
The table method decomposition commonly used want capture additional information function

Before computer solve problem problem way resolved must understood
Decomposition help breaking complex problem manageable part
Decomposition one four cornerstone Computer Science
It
The smaller part examined solved designed individually simpler work
If problem decomposed much harder solve
Dealing many different stage much difficult breaking problem number smaller problem solving one one time
Breaking problem smaller part mean smaller problem examined detail
Similarly trying understand complex system work easier using decomposition
For example understanding bicycle work straightforward whole bike separated smaller part part examined see work detail

PCs smartphones also known general purpose machine
Most computer system follow input process output model
Abstraction decomposition key computing skill
A key difference human computer computer CPU need programmed follow set logical instruction

In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator

The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
Computer program consist thousand line code like textbook thousand word
In way textbook divided chapter program divided related functionality using
In textbook specific concept covered basis
Similarly computer program specific functionality divided named
Programs usually integrate block code module already created project
The program us implemented function procedure module
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
BBC Simon Lumb describes function used programming In computer program often section program want repeat
Chunks instruction given name called
Algorithms broken procedure function

Programming language set also known function procedure
If programmer make one
Functions differ procedure function return value unlike procedure

In program drawing shape program could ask user shape draw

The algorithm action could set task If computer program set instruction could given name sequence would executed calling
A function could calculate VAT due good sold

A OOP associated
An object mostly made data behavior form interface object present outside world
Data represented object behavior method
For example object would method state whether opened closed would property
In method defined object instance given class
One important capability method provides method overriding
The name used multiple different kind class
This allows sending object invoke behavior delegate implementation behavior receiving object
A method Java programming set behavior class object
For example object send message another object appropriate formula invoked whether receiving object etc
Methods also provide interface class use access modify data object
This known encapsulation
Encapsulation overriding two primary distinguishing feature method procedure call
overloading two significant way method differs conventional procedure function call
Overriding refers subclass redefining implementation method superclass
For example may method defined shape class
The various subclass etc
would define appropriate formula calculate area
The idea look object black box change internals object made minimal impact object use
This known encapsulation meant make code easier maintain
Method overloading hand refers differentiating code used handle message based parameter method
If one view receiving object first parameter method overriding special case overloading selection based first argument
The following simple example illustrates difference Accessor method used read data value object
Mutator method used modify data object
Manager method used initialize destroy object class
constructor destructors
These method provide facilitates
For example class provides accessor method retrieve current rather directly accessing balance data field later code implement complex mechanism balance retrieval fetch without dependent code needing changed
The concept encapsulation modularity unique programming
Indeed many way approach simply logical extension previous paradigm
A method called beginning object lifetime create initialize object process called
Initialization may include acquisition resource
Constructors may parameter usually return value language
See following example Java A method called automatically end object lifetime process called
Destruction language allow destructor method argument return value
Destruction implemented perform cleanup chore task object destruction
In language destructors known
They similar purpose function destructors difference language utilize language manual memory management sequence called different
An one
It often used specify subclass must provide implementation method
Abstract method used specify computer language
The following code show abstract class need extended The following subclass extends main class Class method method called rather instance
They typically used part object
class defined instance class object created
allow class created deleted
In sense provide functionality constructor destructors described
But language allows developer dynamically alter object model run time create new class redefine class hierarchy modify property etc
Special method language may support none special method defined
A language compiler may automatically generate default special method programmer may allowed optionally define special method
Most special method directly called rather compiler generates code call appropriate time
Static method meant relevant instance class rather specific instance
They similar static variable sense
An example would static method sum value variable every instance class
For example class might static method compute average price product
In Java commonly used static method This static method owning object run instance
It receives information argument
A static method invoked even instance class exist yet
Static method called static resolved compile time based class called dynamically case instance method resolved polymorphically based runtime type object
operator define action performed compiler class object assigned class object type
Operator method define operation performed symbol associated method parameter
Example Some procedural language extended capability leverage large skill set legacy code language still provide benefit development
Perhaps example extension programming language
Due design requirement add paradigm existing procedural language message passing unique capability terminology
For example method known
also concept member function allow
mean class achieve polymorphic behavior
participate
Example

We seen one function already output message
To use function always write name followed parenthesis
The word basically mean input function
Then function action depending argument
When multiple argument function separate comma
For example give multiple argument print order space separating
We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error
For example requires least one input It important carefully read error get back code work
Python usually give helpful feedback went wrong
However sometimes need look around little bit diagnose problem example
Python say syntax error mean ca understand trying This exercise using function
There connection city Maxime Miniac several bridge
There separate limit amount weight transported across bridge
In order drive along route truck need drive first bridge weight limit one weight limit one weight limit
Your truck crash overload three weight limit
Your code assume variable already contain bridge weight limit
Your truck take either route
Write program print maximum weight transported two city
Assume variable contain bridge weight limit

I heard word hash used different context within world computing different meaning
For example book Learn Python Hard Way said Python call dicts
Other language call hash
So hash dictionary
The common usage word relation encryption
I also heard read people using word hash specific function within programing
So exactly
Can anyone time knowledgeable kindly explain hash hash
The Wikipedia article good I give take
Hash really broad term different formal meaning different context
There single perfect answer question
I explain general underlying concept mention common usage term
A hash function h referred take input object output string number
The input object usually member basic data type like string integer bigger one composed object like user defined structure
The output typically number string
The noun hash often refers output
The verb hash often mean apply hash function
The main property hash function Say want hash number range number
One simple hash function h x x
Depending use case might want hash function satisfy additional property
Here common additional property Often want hash object distinct
Moreover may want hash
If I want hash object bucket output hash function number I usually hoping object land bucket land bucket
Sometimes taken even farther instance cryptography I may want hash function computationally difficult adversary find two different input map output
I often want hash input output fixed number bucket
I may want hash function whose output change run
output hash function object always remain
This may seem conflict uniformity one solution choose hash function randomly change run
One common application data structure hash table way implement dictionary
Here allocate memory say bucket asked store key value pair dictionary hash key number store pair corresponding bucket memory
Then asked look key hash key number hash function check bucket see key
If return value
Note could also implement dictionary way binary search tree object comparable
Another practical application checksum way check two file example file corrupted previous version
Because hash function unlikely map two input output compute store hash first file usually represented string
This hash small maybe dozen ASCII character
Then get second file hash check output
If almost certainly exact file
Another application cryptography hash hard invert given output hash function computationally hard figure input led output
One use password Instead storing password store cryptographic hash password maybe ingredient
Then user enters password compute hash check match correct hash say password correct
Now even someone look find hash saved server easy time pretending user
This application case output long longer input since input short
A function take input produce value fixed size
For example might hash function accepts length produce integer
Typically correct say output aslo known hash value hash sum
However sometimes people refer function
This technically incorrect usually overlooked generally understood context person meant
The typical usage implement
A hash table data structure associate value value typically referred key
It using hash function key produce hash value use fast data store
I wo go full detail key fact called relies upon produce hash
This confusion come people somewhat incorrectly refer hash
As stated answer sometimes given language implementation refers notably Perl though I expect language well
Other language choose refer implementation dictionary
Python one language owing ingrained language many Python user shorten term dictionary
So whilst correct use term refer produced people also sometimes use term informally refer hence creating confusion
A hash function broadly function image smaller
The output function referred hash
In computer science typically encounter two application hash function
The first data structure want map key domain
integer string array index
integer
The goal maximise performance data structure property hash function typically desirable simplicity uniform output distribution
appears causing confusion
I know language
Loosely data structure could seen hash function domain current set key also implemented hash table
The second message authentication verification etc
The domain typically arbitrary byte string
Here concerned security sometimes mean deliberately low performance useful property collision resistance
I try add short summary others say
There special kind function called hash function
hash function cryptographically secure Three main application hash table checksum data integrity check
hard drive ADSL protocol cryptography various form cryptographic authentication including limited digital signature secure password storage
Hash table data structure fast search
It us hash function internally hence name
Databases use hash table search tree internally speed execution search request Hash official name dictionary Perl
They hash table internally hence name
This subroutine accept hash first argument
These day used associative array necessarily hash table
hash image provided check integrity downloading

A lot programming language framework something I ca seem find name even though probably one computer science
What basically bind name
example selectAll example price Java example Foo There many example
You get idea
What trouble virtually way verify much IDE help term code completion navigation refactoring
But besides point
My question called
No quiz sorry sound like one
It simply matter name song programming
Answers helped As people correctly pointed example late binding reflection interpretation etc
However I conclude probably name describes
It bunch example something common enough give name
I liked everything string answer even though funny fully justice either
It called late binding dynamic binding runtime binding
The fact bind string implementation detail although imply mapping exists runtime language like provide
Introspection reflection hand refer ability find interface method attribute object implement runtime
It true symbol ca verified execution make different symbol
Late binding Reflection What make think reflection
The flex thing termed late binding work like normal html
Until user click button runtime bother find function exists
The second thing dependency injection involves function pointer way Interfaces reflection
The java one definitely reflection
I think may able word question properly chosen bad example illustrate thought
Late binding
The second third example example reflection late binding first example
Is rewritten ActionScript compilation part tucked inside event handler function
Something like done exactly checked adding compiler flag The compiler determines attribute event style property since done compile time reflection
Reflection definition done runtime
I think could argued second third example reflection also example late binding
None actually determines capability object work way reflection
However I would say term reflection often used broad sense mean anything call method whose name determined runtime creates object class named runtime
If want precise late binding probably correct answer I think reflection good enough
introspection
By way I surmise Flex code showed u us simply ActionScript invocation case attribute would simply interpreter Flex document
Thus special magic behind kind code simply input interpreter
I think Flex example quite one Java know stuff
The Java example clearly something I would call resolve classname runtime latest possible time
The Flex MXML mainly another syntax eventually get compiled something could also written ActionScript
As far I tell mx Button selectAll function
At least mxmlc give error use undefined symbol
There scenario compiler help Code Generation
If type variable known runtime late binding
If variable type known compile time early binding
Intellisense code completion IDE feature talk available early bound variable
I call Everything String String Universal Data Type String Abuse
Support Smells like function pointer
The Java example gave called Dynamic Class Loading
I sure example thing
But useful reflection
Maybe looking design pattern called Inversion control
In world call databinding handled using reflection
It also reminds strongly dependency injection
The first example example namespaced xml assume meaning compiling time The second injection The third example Reflection I tag example name I think I go Syntax By posting answer agree

method solution problem depends solution smaller instance problem opposed
The approach applied many type problem one central idea computer science
The power recursion evidently lie possibility defining infinite set object finite statement
In manner infinite number computation described finite recursive program even program contains explicit repetition
Most computer programming language support recursion allowing call within program text
Some define looping construct rely solely recursion repeatedly call code
prof language computationally powerful Turing complete imperative language meaning solve kind problem imperative language even without iterative control structure
A common tactic divide problem type original solve combine result
This often referred combined store result solving avoid solving repeatedly incurring extra computation time referred
A recursive function definition one meaning input function produce result without recurring one meaning input program recurs call
For example function defined recursively equation
Neither equation constitutes complete definition first base case second recursive case
Because base case break chain recursion sometimes also called terminating case
The job recursive case seen breaking complex input simpler one
In properly designed recursive function recursive call input problem must simplified way eventually base case must reached
Functions intended terminate normal example exception
Neglecting write base case testing incorrectly cause
For function one computes obvious base case implied input data one may add number term added series example provide criterion establishes base case
Such example naturally treated successive term output partial sum converted recursion using indexing parameter say compute th term th partial sum
Many must process generate arbitrarily large quantity
Recursion one technique representing data whose exact size know programmer specify data definition
There two type definition inductive definition
An inductively defined recursive data definition one specifies construct instance data
For example defined inductively using syntax The code specifies list string either empty structure contains string list string
The definition permit construction list finite number string
Another example inductive positive Similarly recursive often used model structure programming language
Language designer often express grammar syntax grammar simple language arithmetic expression multiplication addition This say expression either number product two expression sum two expression
By recursively referring expression second third line grammar permit arbitrarily complex arithmetic expression one product sum operation single expression
A coinductive data definition one specifies operation may performed piece data typically coinductive definition used data structure infinite size
A coinductive definition infinite string given informally might look like This similar inductive definition list string difference definition specifies access content data via function content may whereas inductive definition specifies create structure may created
related coinduction used compute particular instance possibly infinite object
As programming technique used often context programming language preferable recursion desired size precision program output unknown
In case program requires definition infinitely large infinitely precise result mechanism taking finite portion result
The problem computing first n one solved corecursive program

Recursion contains single known recursion contains multiple known
Standard example single recursion include list traversal linear search computing factorial function standard example multiple recursion include search
Single recursion often much efficient multiple recursion generally replaced iterative computation running linear time requiring constant space
Multiple recursion contrast may require exponential time space fundamentally recursive able replaced iteration without explicit stack
Multiple recursion sometimes converted single recursion desired thence iteration
For example computing Fibonacci sequence naively multiple iteration value requires two previous value computed single recursion passing two successive value parameter
This naturally framed corecursion building initial value tracking step two successive value see
A sophisticated example using allows iterative tree traversal rather multiple recursion
Most basic example recursion example presented demonstrate function call
recursion occurs function called another function called either directly indirectly
For example call direct recursion call call indirect recursion Chains three function possible example function call function function call function function call function
Indirect recursion also called symmetric term though simply difference emphasis different notion
That call call turn call point view alone indirectly recursing point view alone indirectly recursing point view mutually recursing
Similarly set three function call called set mutually recursive function
Recursion usually done explicitly calling function name
However recursion also done via implicitly calling function based current context particularly useful known
Some author classify recursion either structural generative
The distinction related recursive procedure get data work process data Functions consume structured data typically decompose argument immediate structural component process component
If one immediate component belongs class data input function recursive
For reason refer function STRUCTURALLY RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
Thus defining characteristic structurally recursive function argument recursive call content field original input
Structural recursion includes nearly tree traversal including XML processing binary tree creation search etc
By considering algebraic structure natural number natural number either zero successor natural number function factorial may also regarded structural recursion
alternative Many recursive algorithm generate entirely new piece data given data recur
refers kind generative recursion
Examples generative recursion include
This distinction important function
A classic example recursive procedure function used calculate The function also written This evaluation recurrence relation demonstrates computation would performed evaluating pseudocode This factorial function also described without using recursion making use typical looping construct found imperative programming language The imperative code equivalent mathematical definition using accumulator variable The definition translates straightforwardly example iteration implemented recursively
The computes two integer written recursively
Function definition greatest common divisor express The recursive program equivalent iterative algorithm computation shown show step evaluation would performed language eliminates tail call
Below version algorithm using explicit iteration suitable language eliminate tail call
By maintaining state entirely variable using looping construct program avoids making recursive call growing call stack
The iterative algorithm requires temporary variable even given knowledge Euclidean algorithm difficult understand process simple inspection although two algorithm similar step
The Towers Hanoi mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion
There three peg hold stack disk different diameter
A larger disk may never stacked top smaller
Starting disk one peg must moved another peg one time
What smallest number step move stack
Example implementation Although recursive function explicit solution Tower Hanoi sequence reduced explicit formula
The algorithm method searching single element cutting array half recursive pas
The trick pick midpoint near center array compare data point data searched responding one three possible condition data found midpoint data midpoint greater data searched data midpoint le data searched
Recursion used algorithm pas new array created cutting old one half
The binary search procedure called recursively time new smaller array
Typically array size adjusted manipulating beginning ending index
The algorithm exhibit logarithmic order growth essentially divide problem domain half pas
Example implementation binary search C An important application recursion computer science defining dynamic data structure
Recursive data structure dynamically grow theoretically infinite size response runtime requirement contrast size static array must set compile time
Recursive algorithm particularly appropriate underlying problem data treated defined recursive term
The example section illustrate known structural recursion
This term refers fact recursive procedure acting data defined recursively
As long programmer derives template data definition function employ structural recursion
That recursion function body consume immediate piece given compound value
Below C definition linked list node structure
Notice especially node defined term
The next element pointer another effectively creating list type
Because data structure defined recursively procedure operate implemented naturally recursive procedure
The procedure defined walk list list empty list pointer value NULL
For node print data element integer
In C implementation list remains unchanged procedure
Below simple definition binary tree node
Like node linked list defined term recursively
There two pointer left pointing left right pointing right
Operations tree implemented using recursion
Note two pointer left right tree operation may require two recursive call At two recursive call made given call defined
The example illustrates binary tree
A special case binary tree data element node order
Since number file may vary practical way traverse thus enumerate content
Traversing filesystem similar therefore concept behind tree traversal applicable traversing filesystem
More specifically code would example filesystem
This code blend line least somewhat recursion
It essentially recursive implementation best way traverse
It also example direct indirect recursion
The method rtraverse purely direct example method traverse indirect call rtraverse
This example need base case scenario due fact always fixed number file directory given filesystem
In actual implementation rather pure recursive function single check base case otherwise recursive step number modification may made purpose clarity efficiency
These include On basis elegance wrapper function generally approved base case frowned upon particularly academia
Hybrid algorithm often used efficiency reduce overhead recursion small case recursion special case
A function directly called recurse instead calling separate auxiliary function actually recursion
Wrapper function used validate parameter recursive function skip perform initialization allocate memory initialize variable particularly auxiliary variable level recursion partial computation handle exception error
In language support auxiliary function nested inside wrapper function use shared scope
In absence nested function auxiliary function instead separate function possible private called directly information shared wrapper function using
base case also known consists checking base case making recursive call checking next call base case instead calling checking base case
particularly done efficiency reason avoid overhead function call immediately return
Note since base case already checked immediately recursive step need checked separately one need use wrapper function case overall recursion start base case
For example factorial function properly base case
immediately returning
may miss mitigated wrapper function
primarily concern many base case encountered Null pointer tree linear number function call hence significant saving algorithm illustrated search
tree corresponds considering leaf node child base case rather considering empty node base case
If single base case computing factorial provides saving
Conceptually considered either base case recursive step checking base case recursion considered different base case one step removed standard base case complex recursive step namely check valid recurse considering leaf node rather Null node base case tree
Because complicated flow compared clear separation base case recursive step standard recursion often considered poor style particularly academia
A basic example given DFS binary tree see section standard recursive discussion
The standard recursive algorithm DFS In instead In term standard step move base case check recursive step
Alternatively considered different form base case recursive step respectively
Note requires wrapper function handle case tree empty root node Null
In case height node Null pointer child leaf cut number function call half worst case
In C standard recursive algorithm may implemented The algorithm may implemented Note use Boolean AND operator recursive call made node valid
Note first term AND pointer node second term bool overall expression evaluates bool
This common idiom recursive
This addition evaluation Boolean OR operator check right child left child fails
In fact entire function replaced single Boolean expression return statement legibility suffers benefit efficiency
Recursive algorithm often inefficient small data due overhead repeated function call return
For reason efficient implementation recursive algorithm often start recursive algorithm switch different algorithm input becomes small
An important example often implemented switching data sufficiently small
Hybrid recursive algorithm often refined derived hybrid merge sort
Recursion iteration equally expressive recursion replaced iteration explicit stack iteration replaced tail recursion
Which approach preferable depends problem consideration language used
In iteration preferred particularly simple recursion avoids overhead function call call stack management recursion generally used multiple recursion
By contrast recursion preferred tail recursion optimization leading little overhead sometimes explicit iteration available
Compare template compute x defined x f n x x For imperative language overhead define function functional language overhead define accumulator variable x
For example factorial function may implemented iteratively C assigning loop index variable accumulator variable rather passing argument returning value recursion Most use today allow direct specification recursive function procedure
When function called program keep track various instance function often using although method may used
Every recursive function transformed iterative function replacing recursive call simulating call stack explicitly managed program
Conversely iterative function procedure evaluated computer see expressed term recursive function iterative control construct routinely rewritten recursive form
However practice rewriting depends feature language
notable mainstream language function call including may cause stack allocation would occur use looping construct language working iterative program rewritten recursive form may although tail call elimination may feature covered language specification different implementation language may differ tail call elimination capability
In language favor iterative looping construct usually significant time space cost associated recursive program due overhead required manage stack relative slowness function call function call particularly typically fast operation difference usually le noticeable
As concrete example difference performance recursive iterative implementation factorial example depends highly compiler used
In language looping construct preferred iterative version may much several order magnitude faster recursive one
In functional language overall time difference two implementation may negligible fact cost multiplying larger number first rather smaller number iterative version given happens may overwhelm time saved choosing iteration
In programming language maximum size much le space available recursive algorithm tend require stack space iterative algorithm
Consequently language sometimes place limit depth recursion avoid stack overflow one language
Note caveat regarding special case
Multiply recursive problem inherently recursive prior state need track
One example contrast list traversal linear search list singly recursive thus naturally iterative
Other example include function
All algorithm implemented iteratively help explicit programmer effort involved managing stack complexity resulting program arguably outweigh advantage iterative solution
function function recursive call hence build deferred operation
For example gcd function shown
In contrast factorial function also recursive call tail position build deferred multiplication operation must performed final recursive call completes
With treat call rather function call function gcd execute using constant space
Thus program essentially iterative equivalent using imperative language control structure like loop
The significance tail recursion making call tail call caller return position need saved recursive call return branch directly previously saved return position
Therefore language recognize property tail call tail recursion save space time
In simple case function calling instruction placed recursive call executed per recursion instruction placed recursive call
The latter executed repeatedly maximum recursion reached
Consider example The recursive algorithm expressed
They usually simplified single term
If function form Then thus represents number recursive call level recursion represents factor smaller input next level recursion
number piece divide problem represents work function independent recursion
partitioning recombining level recursion

One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division

Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood

A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

Throughout book going using technique called We ca give complete definition term yet chapter introduce building block functional programming Basically mean function thing high school algebra teacher meant except function necessarily relate number
But essential idea like kind function described
In example name function function take called number number
In chapter going use computer explore function going use standard Scheme notation rest book
That chapter want separate idea function complexity programming language notation
For example real Scheme notation let write expression involve one function chapter use one time
To get chapter special computer interface first start running Scheme first chapter type tell Scheme read program using
If trouble loading program look Appendix A information
Then start program type You able carry interaction like following
In text printed type type printing As see different function different number argument
In example added two number took square root one number
However every function give exactly one result time use
To leave program type asks function
Experiment arithmetic function
Try different kind number including integer number decimal fraction
What try divide zero
Throughout chapter going let experiment function rather give long boring list one work
The boring list available reference page
Try These suggestion
Be creative type example
Not Scheme function deal number
A broader category argument including number also including English word like
Even meaningless sequence letter digit considered word
Try function accept word argument
What happens use number argument one
So far function fall one two category arithmetic function require number argument return number result word function accept word argument return word result
The one exception seen
What kind argument accept
What kind value return
The technical term kind data In principle could think almost anything type number contain digit
Such type legitimate sometimes useful also official type Scheme know
Types overlap example number also considered word
The technical term thing function accepts argument function
The name thing function return So domain word range number fact nonnegative integer
This example show range may exactly one standard data type nonnegative integer type Scheme
How talk domain range function
You could say example The function number domain number range
Or informally may also say take number argument return number
For function two argument language little le straightforward
The informal version still work take two integer argument return integer
But ca say The domain two integer domain function possible argument statement characteristic legal argument
By way making certain simplification chapter
For example Scheme function actually accept number argument two
But want go bell whistle start adding two number time
Here example illustrate domain function We going introduce data type function include type domain range
The next type bunch word enclosed parenthesis Do include punctuation character within sentence
Many function accept word domain also accept sentence
There also function accepts word sentence
Try example like sentence
Other important function used ask question
That range function contains two value one meaning true meaning false
Try numeric comparison function work word sentence
The question mark part name function
There also function whose domain range value
The two value true false called named George Boole developed formal tool used value mathematics
What good value
Often program must choose two option If number positive negative
Scheme function make choice based value
For experiment function
Its first argument must true false others anything
So far data type include number word sentence Booleans
Scheme several data type consider one
A used data
Here example The range nonnegative integer
But domain For example try using argument
If used computer programming language may seem strange use part computer data
Most language make sharp distinction program data
soon see ability treat function data help make Scheme programming powerful convenient
Try example Think carefully
You applying function sentence applying function function sentence
Other function used include whose domain integer whose domain everything
If reading book trying thing computer go along get work
Spend time getting used idea thinking
When done read ahead
The idea heart mathematics computer science
For example mathematician want think formally system number use function create integer
They say let suppose one number called zero let suppose given
By applying function repeatedly create
Functions important computer science give u way think simple English way think something happening something changing
A function embodies information taking something know returning something know
That computer They transform information produce new result
A lot mathematics taught school number seen function number
used function word sentence even function function
You imagine function transform information kind function French window function capital California
You done lot thinking function
You add two number make sense add two word number
Some function complicated domain acceptable value one argument depend specific value used one
The function example make sure tried positive negative number fractional well power
Part definition function always get answer whenever call function argument
The value returned function word change regardless anything else may computed meanwhile
One function explored chapter real function according rule one
The rule may seem restrictive indeed often convenient use name function loosely process give different result different circumstance
But see sometimes important stick strict definition refrain using process truly function
We hinted two different way thinking function
The first called Here function rule tell u transform information information
The function rule thing right
The actual thing word number whatever function manipulates
The second way thinking called In view function perfectly good thing
We use function argument another function example
Research college math student show second idea hard people worth effort see function function like make program much easier write
As homey analogy think carrot peeler
If focus attention want peeler represents process
We peeling carrot
We applying function carrot
It carrot count
But also think peeler thing right clean worry whether blade sharp enough
The big idea explored chapter although used lot Chapter function using result one function argument another function
crucial idea write large program defining bunch small function composing produce desired result
We start next chapter return real Scheme notation
In line following table left one piece information
Fill missing detail
What domain function
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
Make sure try lot case
Hint Think name
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
The following exercise ask function meet certain criterion
For convenience function chapter
List function chapter type return value always different type argument
List function chapter type return value sometimes different type argument
Mathematicians sometimes use term operator mean function two argument type return result type
Which function seen chapter satisfy definition
An operator possible argument
For example commutative
Which operator Exercise commutative
An operator possible argument
For example associative
Which operator Exercise associative
Certain punctuation character also used word let defer detail gotten know word function simpler example
Unless version Scheme complex number
Real mathematician say The domain Cartesian cross product integer integer
In order avoid mouthful use informal wording
Yes English word
It astronomy

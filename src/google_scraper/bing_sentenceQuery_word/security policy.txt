A defines goal element organization computer system
The definition highly formal informal
Security policy enforced organizational policy security mechanism
A technical implementation defines whether computer system
These formal policy categorized core security principle Confidentiality Integrity Availability
For example whereas
If system regarded set transition operation change system state seen statement partition state authorized unauthorized one
Given simple definition one define one start authorized state never enter unauthorized state
To represent concrete policy especially automated enforcement language representation needed
There exist lot application specific language closely coupled security mechanism enforce policy application
Compared abstract policy language
independent concrete mechanism

protection theft damage well service provide
Information security includes controlling physical access hardware well protecting harm may come via network access data code injection
Also due operator whether accidental security susceptible deviating secure procedure various method
The field growing importance due increasing reliance computer system growth including tiny device part Internet Things
A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack
act masquerading valid entity falsification data username order gain access information resource one otherwise unauthorized obtain
There several type spoofing including describes malicious modification product
security service planting surveillance capability router example
describes situation attacker level restricted access able without authorization elevate privilege access level
For example standard computer user may able fool system giving access restricted data even full unrestricted access system
attempt acquire sensitive information usernames password credit card detail directly user
Phishing typically carried often directs user enter detail fake website whose look feel almost identical legitimate one
Preying victim trust phishing classified form
also known UI redress attack User Interface redress attack malicious technique attacker trick user clicking button link another webpage user intended click top level page
This done using multiple transparent opaque layer
The attacker basically click meant top level page routing irrelevant page likely owned someone else
A similar technique used hijack keystroke
Carefully drafting combination stylesheets iframes button text box user led believing typing password information authentic webpage channeled invisible frame controlled attacker
aim convince user disclose secret password card number etc
example impersonating bank contractor customer
A common scam involves fake CEO email sent accounting finance department
In early reported scam cost US business two year
In May team victim type cyber scam perpetrator impersonating team president resulting handover team employee tax form
Employee behavior big impact information security organization
Cultural concept help different segment organization work effectively work effectiveness towards information security within Relationship Organizational Culture Information Security provides following definition information security culture totality pattern behavior organization contribute protection information Andersson Reimers found employee often see part organization Information Security effort often take action ignore organizational Information Security best interest
Research show Information security culture need improved continuously
In Security Culture Analysis author commented never ending process cycle evaluation change To manage information security culture five step taken strategic planning operative planning implementation
The growth number computer system increasing reliance upon individual business industry government mean increasing number system risk
The computer system financial regulator financial institution like SWIFT investment bank commercial bank prominent hacking target cybercriminals interested manipulating market making illicit gain
Web site apps accept store brokerage account information also prominent hacking target potential immediate financial gain transferring money making purchase selling information
payment system also tampered order gather customer account data
Computers control function many utility including coordination valve opening closing water gas network
The Internet potential attack vector machine connected worm demonstrated even equipment controlled computer connected Internet vulnerable
In division investigated hacking incident energy company
Vulnerabilities many use local radio cellular communication cause problem billing fraud
The industry reliant series complex system could attacked
A simple power outage one airport cause repercussion worldwide much system relies radio transmission could disrupted controlling aircraft ocean especially dangerous radar surveillance extends mile offshore
There also potential attack within aircraft
In Europe NewPENS US NextGen program moving create dedicated network
The consequence successful attack range loss confidentiality loss system integrity outage loss aircraft even loss life
Desktop computer laptop commonly targeted gather password financial account information construct attack another target
device like sensor camera microphone GPS receiver compass could exploited may collect personal information including sensitive health information
Wifi Bluetooth cell phone network device could used attack vector sensor might remotely activated successful breach
The increasing number device also potential target
Large corporation common target
In many case aimed financial gain identity theft involves loss million client credit card detail recent breach
Some cyberattacks ordered foreign government government engage intent spread propaganda sabotage spy target
Many people believe Russian government played major role US presidential election using Twitter Facebook affect result election whether true ultimately determined congress
Medical record targeted use general identify theft health insurance fraud impersonating patient obtain prescription drug recreational purpose resale
Although cyber threat continue increase organization increase security training business
Not attack financially motivated however example security firm suffered serious series attack group retaliation firm CEO claiming infiltrated group motive appears embarrass data leak cripple company wiping workstation server
Vehicles increasingly computerized engine timing seat belt tensioners door lock many model
Additionally may use bluetooth communicate onboard consumer device cell phone network
expected even complex
All system carry security risk issue gained wide attention
Simple example risk include malicious used attack vector car onboard microphone used eavesdropping
However access gained car internal danger much greater widely publicised test hacker remotely carjacked vehicle mile away drove ditch
Manufacturers reacting number way pushing security fix air car computer system
In area autonomous vehicle September announced initial safety standard called state come uniform policy
Government computer system commonly attacked activist foreign power
Local regional government infrastructure control police intelligence agency communication student record financial system also potential target largely computerized
government control access facility use vulnerable
The IoT network physical object device vehicle building enables collect exchange data concern raised developed without appropriate consideration security challenge involved
While IoT creates opportunity direct integration physical world system also provides opportunity misuse
In particular Internet Things spread widely cyber attack likely become increasingly physical rather simply virtual threat
If front door lock connected Internet phone criminal could enter home press button stolen hacked phone
People could stand lose much credit card number world controlled device
Thieves also used electronic mean circumvent hotel door lock
either successfully attacked potentially deadly vulnerability demonstrated including diagnostic equipment implanted device including
There many report hospital hospital organization getting hacked including attack exploit virus sensitive data stored hospital server
On December US released recommendation medical maintain security device structure enforcement
Serious financial damage caused standard model estimating cost incident data available made public organization involved
Several computer security consulting firm produce estimate total worldwide loss attributable attack hostile digital act general
The loss estimate firm range billion worm virus billion form covert attack
The reliability estimate often challenged underlying methodology basically anecdotal
Security breach continue cost business billion dollar survey revealed security staff believe senior leadership take cyber precaution strategic priority
However reasonable estimate financial cost security breach actually help organization make rational investment decision
According classic analyzing optimal investment level information security one conclude amount firm spends protect information generally small fraction expected loss loss resulting
As motivation breach computer security vary attacker
Some activist others criminal looking financial gain
attacker common well resourced started amateur hacked recounted
A standard part particular system identify might motivate attack system might motivated breach
The level detail precaution vary depending system secured
A home military face different threat even underlying technology use similar
In computer security countermeasure action device procedure technique reduces eliminating preventing minimizing harm cause discovering reporting corrective action taken
End user security habit
Reimers Andersson conducted number study end user security habit found type repeated security best practice marked effect perception compliance good end user network security habit especially concerning malware ransomeware
Some common countermeasure listed following section alternately secure design mean software designed ground secure
In case security considered main feature
Some technique approach include The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture design describe security control security countermeasure positioned relate overall
These control serve purpose maintain system quality attribute confidentiality integrity availability accountability
Techopedia defines security architecture unified security design address necessity potential risk involved certain scenario environment
It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking
Another implementation physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic
Firewalls common amongst machine permanently connected
Some organization turning platform extend data accessibility detect
However relatively organisation maintain computer system effective detection system fewer still organised response mechanism place
As result Reuters point Companies first time report losing electronic theft data physical stealing asset
The primary obstacle effective eradication cyber crime could traced excessive reliance firewall automated detection system
Yet basic evidence gathering using put criminal behind bar
Vulnerability management cycle identifying remediating mitigating especially
Vulnerability management integral computer security
Vulnerabilities discovered analyzes computer system search known vulnerability insecure software configuration susceptibility Beyond vulnerability scanning many organisation contract outside security auditor run regular system identify vulnerability
In sector contractual requirement
While correctness computer system possible yet common
Operating system formally verified include make small percentage market
properly implemented virtually impossible directly break
Breaking requires input stolen key stolen plaintext either end transmission extra cryptanalytic information
method mitigating unauthorized access system sensitive information
It requires something know password PIN something card dongle cellphone piece hardware
This increase security unauthorized person need gain access
The tight security measure le unauthorized hack
Social engineering direct computer access physical attack prevented mean difficult enforce relative sensitivity information
Training often involved help mitigate risk even highly disciplined environment
military organization social engineering attack still difficult foresee prevent
Enoculation derived seek prevent social engineering fraudulent trick trap instilling resistance persuasion attempt exposure similar related attempt
It possible reduce attacker chance keeping system date security patch update using security scanner hiring competent people responsible security
The effect data reduced careful
While hardware may source insecurity microchip vulnerability maliciously introduced manufacturing process assisted computer security also offer alternative computer security
Using device method case drive lock disabling USB port access may considered secure due physical access sophisticated required order compromised
Each covered detail
One use term computer security refers technology used implement secure
In DoD used standard current international standard defines number progressively stringent
Many common operating system meet standard Methodically Designed Tested Reviewed required highest level mean uncommon
An example Semiformally Verified Design Tested system used several military jet
In software engineering aim guard accidental introduction security vulnerability
It also possible create software designed ground secure
Such system
Beyond aim prove underlying system important example
Within computer system two many capable enforcing privilege separation ACLs
Using ACLs confine program proven insecure many situation host computer tricked indirectly allowing restricted file access issue known
It also shown promise ACLs giving access object one person never guaranteed practice
Both problem resolved capability
This mean practical flaw exist system designer certain utility must take responsibility ensure introduce flaw
Capabilities mostly restricted research commercial OSs still use ACLs
Capabilities however also implemented language level leading style programming essentially refinement standard design
An open source project area
The secure computer connected Internet shielded interference
In real world secure system
Responding forcefully attempted manner one would attempted physical security breach often difficult variety reason Some illustrative example different type computer security breach given
In computer connected Internet mainframe minicomputer professional workstation

In early American apparel home good company announced victim hacker accessed system stored data merchandise return transaction
The computer worm known reportedly ruined almost Iran disrupting industrial PLCs targeted attack generally believed launched Israel United States although neither publicly admitted
In early document provided published exposing massive scale global surveillance
It also revealed NSA deliberately inserted backdoor standard encryption tapped link data centre
In hacking ring known Rescator broke computer stealing roughly million credit card computer stealing million credit card number
Warnings delivered corporation ignored physical security breach using believed played large role
The malware utilized absolutely unsophisticated uninteresting say Jim Walter director threat intelligence operation security technology company McAfee meaning heist could easily stopped existing administrator responded warning
The size theft resulted major attention state Federal United States authority investigation ongoing
In April year earlier data breach resulting theft approximately million personnel record handled office
The Office Personnel Management hack described federal official among largest breach government data history United States
Data targeted breach included name date place birth address fingerprint current former government employee well anyone undergone government background check
It believed hack perpetrated Chinese hacker motivation remains unclear
In July hacker group known The Impact Team successfully breached extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison
The group claimed taken company data user data well
After breach The Impact Team dumped email company CEO prove point threatened dump customer data unless website taken permanently
With initial data release group stated instructed take Ashley Madison Established Men offline permanently form release customer record including profile customer secret sexual fantasy matching credit card transaction real name address employee document email
The website may stay online
When Avid Life Media parent company created Ashley Madison website take site offline The Impact Group released two compressed file one second
After second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned website remained functional
Conflict law cyberspace become major cause concern computer security community
Some main challenge complaint antivirus industry lack global web regulation global base common rule judge eventually punish cyber criminal
There global cyber law cyber security treaty invoked enforcing global cyber security issue
International legal issue cyber attack complicated nature
Even antivirus firm locates cybercriminal behind creation particular piece form often local authority take action due lack law prosecute
Authorship attribution cyber crime cyber attack major problem law enforcement agency
Computer virus switch one country another one jurisdiction another moving around world using fact capability globally police operation like

Critical study security distinction policy mechanism

A statement allowed

A method tool procedure enforcing security policy
Mechanisms nontechnical requiring proof identity changing password fact policy often require procedural mechanism technology enforce
As example suppose university computer science laboratory policy prohibits student copying another student homework file
The computer system provides mechanism preventing others reading user file
Anna fails use mechanism protect homework file Bill copy
A breach security occurred Bill violated security policy
Anna failure protect file authorize Bill copy
In example Anna could easily protected file
In environment protection may easy
For example Internet provides rudimentary security mechanism adequate protect information sent network
Nevertheless act recording password sensitive information violate implicit security policy site specifically password user confidential property recorded anyone
Policies may presented mathematically list allowed secure disallowed nonsecure state
For purpose assume given policy provides axiomatic description secure state nonsecure state
In practice policy rarely precise normally describe English user staff allowed
The ambiguity inherent description lead state classified allowed disallowed
For example consider homework policy discussed
If someone look another user directory without copying homework file violation security
The answer depends site custom rule regulation law outside focus may change time
When two different site communicate cooperate entity compose security policy based security policy two entity
If policy inconsistent either site must decide security policy combined site
The inconsistency often manifest security breach
For example proprietary document given university policy confidentiality corporation would conflict open policy university
The university company must develop mutual security policy meet need order produce consistent policy
When two site communicate independent third party Internet service provider complexity situation grows rapidly
Given security policy specification secure nonsecure action security mechanism prevent attack detect attack recover attack
The strategy may used together separately
mean attack fail
For example one attempt break host Internet host connected Internet attack prevented
Typically prevention involves implementation mechanism user override trusted implemented correct unalterable way attacker defeat mechanism changing
Preventative mechanism often cumbersome interfere system use point hinder normal use system
But simple preventative mechanism password aim prevent unauthorized user accessing system become widely accepted
Prevention mechanism prevent compromise part system place resource protected mechanism need monitored security problem least theory
useful attack prevented also indicate effectiveness preventative measure
Detection mechanism accept attack occur goal determine attack way occurred report
The attack may monitored however provide data nature severity result
Typical detection mechanism monitor various aspect system looking action information indicating attack
A good example mechanism one give warning user enters incorrect password three time
The login may continue error message system log report unusually high number mistyped password
Detection mechanism prevent compromise part system serious drawback
The resource protected detection mechanism continuously periodically monitored security problem
two form
The first stop attack ass repair damage caused attack
As example attacker deletes file one recovery mechanism would restore file backup tape
In practice recovery far complex nature attack unique
Thus type extent damage difficult characterize completely
Moreover attacker may return recovery involves identification fixing vulnerability used attacker enter system
In case retaliation attacking attacker system taking legal step hold attacker accountable part recovery
In case system functioning inhibited attack
By definition recovery requires resumption correct operation
In second form recovery system continues function correctly attack way
This type recovery quite difficult implement complexity computer system
It draw technique fault tolerance well technique security typically used system
It differs first form recovery point system function incorrectly
However system may disable nonessential functionality
Of course type recovery often implemented weaker form whereby system detects incorrect functioning automatically corrects attempt correct error

Securing Internet present great challenge research opportunity
Potential application Internet voting universally available medical record ubiquitous hindered serious security privacy concern
The epidemic hacker attack personal computer web site highlight inherent vulnerability current computer network infrastructure
Adequately addressing security privacy concern requires combination technical social legal approach
Topics currently active investigation department include mathematical modeling security property implementation application cryptographic protocol secure distributed algorithm trust management verification security property code
There also interest legal aspect security privacy intellectual property within department Yale Law school cooperate
Some topic described greater detail
interested problem involved securing large distributed algorithm disruption untrustworthy participant
Using cryptographic technique may possible allow intermediate result distributed algorithm certified independently provides reducing problem choosing machine trust
These issue become especially important system network association system voluntary limited machine control algorithm designer interested foundation electronic commerce fundamental problem complexity theory motivated cryptology
One problem power computation
Can owner private database use superior processing power one machine perhaps fee without reveal database machine
In set influential paper Abadi Don Beaver Lance Fortnow Joe Kilian Professor Feigenbaum showed computation limited power owner consult single machine extremely powerful owner consult multiple machine instance hiding closely related central theme complexity theory interactive provability average complexity inherent communication cost multiparty protocol
In another direction Professor Feigenbaum founded research area trust management collaboration Matt Blaze Jack Lacy
Emerging Internet service use encryption scale require sophisticated mechanism managing trust
receive cryptographically signed request action decide whether grant request
In centralized distributed computing community authorizer make decision based identity person signed request
Global however rely identity
Most merchant contact typical prospective customer prior first time receive request
Making authorization decision type environment requires formal technique specifying security policy security credential rigorously determining whether particular set credential prof request complies policy deferring trust credential issuer
The PolicyMaker KeyNote system Blaze Lacy John Ioannidis Angelos Keromytis impact mechanism
interested security problem connected Internet voting generally trust security multiparty computation
He developing artificial society trust precise algorithmic meaning
In setting trust learned used decision making
Better decision lead greater social success
This framework allows development analysis simple algorithm learning utilizing trust easily implementable variety setting arguably similar people commonly use everyday life
lead FLINT group Yale developing system secure mobile code based authentication logic code certifying compiler
Authentication logic formal logic allow one reason property system protocol verify identity user decide whether permit various operation
Modeling system provides usual benefit formal analysis hidden assumption made explicit redundant feature exposed flaw system may found
code PCC allows code producer provide compiled program host along formal proof safety
The host specify safety policy set axiom reasoning safety producer proof must term axiom
certifying compiler compiler use static type information help generate provably safe target code
These technology fit together naturally form foundation modern secure system

Defining computer security trivial
The difficulty lie developing definition broad enough valid regardless system described yet specific enough describe security really
In generic sense security freedom risk danger
In context computer science security prevention protection This Security ability system protect information system resource respect confidentiality integrity
Note scope second definition includes system resource include CPUs disk program addition information
Computer security frequently associated three core area conveniently summarized acronym CIA A strong security protocol address three area
Take example Netscape SSL Secure Sockets Layer protocol
It enabled explosion ecommerce really trust precisely lack trust
SSL overcomes lack trust transacting party ensuring confidentiality encryption integrity checksum authentication via server certificate see Chapter
Computer security restricted three broad concept
Additional idea often considered part taxonomy computer security include These additional element neatly integrate singular definition
From one perspective concept privacy confidentiality security quite distinct posse different attribute
Privacy property individual confidentiality property data security property assigned computer hardware software system
From practical perspective concept interwoven
A system maintain data confidentiality individual privacy could theoretically even mathematically secure probably would wise deploy anywhere real world
Computer security also analyzed function
It broken five distinct functional area Analyzing security function valuable part security planning process strong security policy address five area starting recovery
This book however primarily concerned prevention detection
Computer security also frequently defined term several interdependent domain roughly map specific department job title This text solely concerned latter two
System network security difficult impossible separate UNIX system
Nearly every UNIX distribution past fifteen year included protocol implementation well numerous network service FTP Telnet DNS recently HTTP
In spirit practicality I like straightforward definition promulgated Simson Garfinkel Gene Spafford Practical UNIX Internet Security A computer secure depend software behave expect
In essence computer secure trust
Data entered today still tomorrow unaltered form
If made service x z available yesterday still available today
I also like practical definition offered Tomas Olovsson narrowed bit A secure system system enough trust put use together sensitive information
These practical definition circumvent obvious element secure system hard unauthorized person break value work necessary unauthorized person break exceed value protected data

This chapter present basic concept computer security
The remainder book elaborate concept order reveal logic underlying principle concept
We begin basic service protect threat security system
The next section discus security policy identify threat define requirement ensuring secure system
Security mechanism detect prevent attack recover succeed
Analyzing security system requires understanding mechanism enforce security policy
It also requires knowledge related assumption trust lead threat degree may realized
Such knowledge allows one design better mechanism policy neutralize threat
This process lead risk analysis
Human being weakest link security mechanism system
Therefore policy procedure must take people account
This chapter discus topic
Computer security rest confidentiality integrity availability
The interpretation three aspect vary context arise
The interpretation aspect given environment dictated need individual custom law particular organization
Confidentiality concealment information resource
The need keeping information secret arises use computer sensitive field government industry
For example military civilian institution government often restrict access information need information
The first formal work computer security motivated military attempt implement control enforce need know principle
This principle also applies industrial firm keep proprietary design secure lest competitor try steal design
As example type institution keep personnel record secret
Access control mechanism support confidentiality
One access control mechanism preserving confidentiality cryptography scramble data make incomprehensible
A control access unscrambled data cryptographic key becomes another datum protected
Enciphering income tax return prevent anyone reading
If owner need see return must deciphered
Only possessor cryptographic key enter deciphering program
However someone else read key entered program confidentiality tax return compromised
Other mechanism prevent process illicitly accessing information
Unlike enciphered data however data protected control read control fail bypassed
Then advantage offset corresponding disadvantage
They protect secrecy data completely cryptography fail evaded data becomes visible
Confidentiality also applies existence data sometimes revealing data
The precise number people distrust politician may le important knowing poll taken politician staff
How particular government agency harassed citizen country may le important knowing harassment occurred
Access control mechanism sometimes conceal mere existence data lest existence reveal information protected
Resource hiding another important aspect confidentiality
Sites often wish conceal configuration well system using organization may wish others know specific equipment could used without authorization inappropriate way company renting time service provider may want others know resource using
Access control mechanism provide capability well
All mechanism enforce confidentiality require supporting service system
The assumption security service rely kernel agent supply correct data
Thus assumption trust underlie confidentiality mechanism
Integrity refers trustworthiness data resource usually phrased term preventing improper unauthorized change
Integrity includes data integrity content information origin integrity source data often called
The source information may bear accuracy credibility trust people place dichotomy illustrates principle aspect integrity known credibility central proper functioning system
We return issue discussing malicious logic
A newspaper may print information obtained leak White House attribute wrong source
The information printed received preserving data integrity source incorrect corrupting origin integrity
Integrity mechanism fall two class mechanism mechanism
Prevention mechanism seek maintain integrity data blocking unauthorized attempt change data attempt change data unauthorized way
The distinction two type attempt important
The former occurs user try change data authority change
The latter occurs user authorized make certain change data try change data way
For example suppose accounting system computer
Someone break system try modify accounting data
Then unauthorized user tried violate integrity accounting database
But accountant hired firm maintain book try embezzle money sending overseas hiding transaction user accountant tried change data accounting data unauthorized way moving Swiss bank account
Adequate authentication access control generally stop outside preventing second type attempt requires different control
Detection mechanism try prevent violation integrity simply report data integrity longer trustworthy
Detection mechanism may analyze system event user system action detect problem commonly may analyze data see required expected constraint still hold
The mechanism may report actual cause integrity violation specific part file altered may simply report file corrupt
Working integrity different working confidentiality
With confidentiality data either compromised integrity includes correctness trustworthiness data
The origin data obtained well data protected arrived current machine well data protected current machine affect integrity data
Thus evaluating integrity often difficult relies assumption source data trust underpinnings security often overlooked
Availability refers ability use information resource desired
Availability important aspect reliability well system design unavailable system least bad system
The aspect availability relevant security someone may deliberately arrange deny access data service making unavailable
System design usually assume statistical model analyze expected pattern use mechanism ensure availability statistical model hold
Someone may able manipulate use parameter control use network traffic assumption statistical model longer valid
This mean mechanism keeping resource data available working environment designed
As result often fail
Suppose Anne compromised bank secondary system server supply bank account balance
When anyone else asks server information Anne supply information desire
Merchants validate check contacting bank primary balance server
If merchant get response secondary server asked supply data
colleague prevents merchant contacting primary balance server merchant query go secondary server
Anne never check turned regardless actual account balance
Notice bank one server primary one scheme would work
The merchant would unable validate check
Attempts block availability called difficult detect analyst must determine unusual access pattern attributable deliberate manipulation resource environment
Complicating determination nature statistical model
Even model accurately describes environment atypical event simply contribute nature statistic
A deliberate attempt make resource unavailable may simply look like atypical event
In environment may even appear atypical

It latest string effort United States country recruit train cybersecurity worker suggesting could many million unfilled job field
Specialized cybersecurity degree scholarship program cropping university Rochester Institute growing rapidly size filled student want acquire relevant employable skillset
But skillset
What thing every person training cybersecurity professional course next decade know
There surprisingly little consensus around perhaps surprising given new phenomenon cybersecurity training program rapidly field changing
The frenzy training sufficient quantity cybersecurity worker may downside
Of course people doctor lawyer deal new discovery development field
But established field fairly uniform set expectation around constitute critical foundational skill mode thinking learn regardless go school become surgeon corporate lawyer mechanical engineer
Even computer science relatively recent addition academic world developed reasonably standardized core curriculum student expected teacher know teaching
These day receive degree computer science without background algorithm programming system many core course topic would likely include material relevant security issue
After figuring secure network many way totally different skillset thinking write secure code design secure device
Still possible requiring course could I teach cybersecurity course I certainly opposed principle
But pour many million dollar thousand student program clearer sense learning security specifically
Do need trained software security
Hardware security
Penetration testing
Anomaly detection
Security economics metric
Policy international conflict
This surely challenge faced every new emerging essential body knowledge breaking unit course curriculum casting envious look division sequence honed century field like mathematics chemistry foreign language
What make cybersecurity different short grace period figuring taught workforce future know
Computer security perceived devastating dangerous potential bring power grid cripple national security cost economy billion destroy notion personal going nothing trying train thousand thousand worker pretty immediately
Even u teach wrestling question developing tentative curriculum training program age expertise level multiplying everywhere world built different model
In Israel offer training cybersecurity student group periphery underrepresented IDF Intelligence Corps
In elaborate suite computer game online puzzle called Cyber Security Challenge used cultivate identify talent field
In China People Liberation Army run Information Engineering University Zhengzhou earlier year Chinese philanthropist Henry Cheng million China Internet Development Foundation support additional cybersecurity training
And addition newly proposed CyberCorps Reserve United States already CyberCorps scholarship program well cadre initiative run National Initiative Cybersecurity Careers Studies
At moment almost every area cybersecurity policy law enforcement access encrypted smartphones appropriate channel protection threat information thing many government seem able agree need cybersecurity professional
Terrified country get left behind rush hire security worker public private sector policymakers funneling money cybersecurity workforce training capacity building
Everyone certain need much larger cybersecurity workforce currently one sure workforce need know go teaching
Figuring take lot trial error disagreement careful assessment comparison different model currently piloted around world
And time may also find training people wrong way turn skill need protect whatever turn viable imminent threat posed computer technology
Ideally course period figuring work work workforce training would coincide trying train million people fill cybersecurity job ramp number seems pretty inevitable point
In light would nice see policymakers United States elsewhere focus little assessing comparing cybersecurity education program well quality student churn
The frenzy training sufficient quantity cybersecurity worker may come expense quality training desire profit providing training may lead much competition space would better served collaboration cooperation right
Developing cybersecurity training program require u smart drawing existing expertise experience private sector military civilian branch government overseas
We need pay attention content take advantage hard lesson still learning online threat look like defended
We need try creative rigorous designing training program also assessing ability graduate protect u threat future
Our future cybersecurity workforce good training program right even u teach clear sense effective
And could
For part making go along

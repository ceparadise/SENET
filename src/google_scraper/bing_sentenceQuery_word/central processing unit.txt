A within carry performing basic logical control operation specified instruction
The computer industry used term central processing unit least since early
Traditionally term CPU refers specifically processing unit CU distinguishing core element computer external component circuitry
The form implementation CPUs changed course history fundamental operation remains almost unchanged
Principal component CPU include ALU performs arithmetic supply ALU store result ALU operation control unit orchestrates fetching memory execution instruction directing coordinated operation ALU register component
Most modern CPUs meaning contained single IC chip
An IC contains CPU may also contain memory interface component computer integrated device variously called SoC
Some computer employ single chip containing two CPUs called core context one speak single chip
Array processor multiple processor operate parallel unit considered central
There also exists concept abstraction dynamical aggregated computational resource
Early computer physically rewired perform different task caused machine called computer
Since term CPU generally defined device computer program execution earliest device could rightly called CPUs came advent
The idea computer already present design initially omitted could finished sooner
On June ENIAC made mathematician distributed paper entitled
It outline computer would eventually completed August designed perform certain number instruction operation various type
Significantly program written EDVAC stored rather specified physical wiring computer
This overcame severe limitation ENIAC considerable time effort required reconfigure computer perform new task
With von Neumann design program EDVAC ran could changed simply changing content memory
EDVAC however first computer small prototype computer ran first program June ran first program night June
Early CPUs custom design used part larger sometimes distinctive computer
However method designing custom CPUs particular application largely given way development processor produced large quantity
This standardization began era discrete rapidly accelerated popularization IC
The IC allowed increasingly complex CPUs designed manufactured tolerance order
Both miniaturization standardization CPUs increased presence digital device modern life far beyond limited application dedicated computing machine
Modern microprocessor appear electronic device ranging automobile cellphone sometimes even toy
While von Neumann often credited design computer design EDVAC design became known others suggested implemented similar idea
The completed EDVAC also utilized design using rather electronic memory
The key difference von Neumann Harvard architecture latter separate storage treatment CPU instruction data former us memory space
Most modern CPUs primarily von Neumann design CPUs Harvard architecture seen well especially embedded application instance microcontrollers Harvard architecture processor
thermionic tube commonly used switching element useful computer requires thousand ten thousand switching device
The overall speed system dependent speed switch
Tube computer like EDVAC tended average eight hour failure whereas relay computer like slower earlier failed rarely
In end CPUs became dominant significant speed advantage afforded generally outweighed reliability problem
Most early synchronous CPUs ran low compared modern microelectronic design
Clock signal frequency ranging MHz common time limited largely speed switching device built
The design complexity CPUs increased various technology facilitated building smaller reliable electronic device
The first improvement came advent
Transistorized CPUs longer built bulky unreliable fragile switching element like
With improvement complex reliable CPUs built onto one several containing discrete individual component
In introduced computer architecture used series computer capable running program different speed performance
This significant time electronic computer incompatible one another even made manufacturer
To facilitate improvement IBM utilized concept often called microcode still see widespread usage modern CPUs
The architecture popular dominated market decade left legacy still continued similar modern computer like IBM
In DEC introduced another influential computer aimed scientific research market
computer several distinct advantage predecessor
Aside facilitating increased reliability lower power consumption transistor also allowed CPUs operate much higher speed short switching time transistor comparison tube relay
The increased reliability dramatically increased speed switching element almost exclusively transistor time CPU clock rate ten megahertz easily obtained period
Additionally discrete transistor IC CPUs heavy usage new design like Single Instruction Multiple Data began appear
These early experimental design later gave rise era specialized like made
During period method manufacturing many interconnected transistor compact space developed
The integrated circuit IC allowed large number transistor manufactured single chip
At first basic digital circuit miniaturized ICs
CPUs based building block ICs generally referred integration SSI device
SSI ICs one used usually contained dozen transistor
To build entire CPU SSI ICs required thousand individual chip still consumed much le space power earlier discrete transistor design
IBM used SSI ICs rather module
DEC also switched individual transistor used SSI ICs extremely popular line originally built SSI ICs eventually implemented LSI component became practical
Lee Boysel published influential article including manifesto described build equivalent mainframe computer relatively small number circuit LSI
At time way build LSI chip chip hundred gate build using MOS process
However company continued build processor bipolar chip much faster MOS chip example built processor TTL chip early
At time MOS ICs slow considered useful niche application required low power
As technology advanced increasing number transistor placed ICs decreasing number individual ICs needed complete CPU
MSI LSI ICs increased transistor count hundred thousand
By number ICs required build complete CPU reduced ICs eight different type IC containing roughly MOSFETs
In stark contrast SSI MSI predecessor first LSI implementation contained CPU composed four LSI integrated circuit
Since introduction first commercially available microprocessor first widely used class CPUs almost completely overtaken central processing unit implementation method
Mainframe minicomputer manufacturer time launched proprietary IC development program upgrade older eventually produced compatible microprocessor older hardware software
Combined advent eventual success ubiquitous term applied almost exclusively microprocessor
Several CPUs denoted combined single processing chip
Previous generation CPUs implemented numerous small ICs one circuit board
Microprocessors hand CPUs manufactured small number ICs usually one
The overall smaller CPU size result implemented single die mean faster switching time physical factor like decreased gate
This allowed synchronous microprocessor clock rate ranging ten megahertz several gigahertz
Additionally ability construct exceedingly small transistor IC increased complexity number transistor single CPU many fold
This widely observed trend described proven fairly accurate predictor growth CPU IC complexity
While complexity size construction general form CPUs changed enormously since notable basic design function changed much
Almost common CPUs today accurately described von Neumann machine
As aforementioned Moore law continues hold true concern arisen limit integrated circuit transistor technology
Extreme miniaturization causing effect phenomenon like become much significant
These newer concern among many factor causing researcher investigate new method computing well expand usage method extend usefulness classical von Neumann model
The fundamental operation CPUs regardless physical form take execute sequence stored called program
The instruction executed kept kind
Nearly CPUs follow fetch decode execute step operation collectively known
After execution instruction entire process repeat next instruction cycle normally fetching instruction incremented value
If jump instruction executed program counter modified contain address instruction jumped program execution continues normally
In complex CPUs multiple instruction fetched decoded executed simultaneously
This section describes generally referred quite common among simple CPUs used many electronic device often called microcontroller
It largely ignores important role therefore access stage pipeline
Some instruction manipulate program counter rather producing result data directly instruction generally called jump facilitate program behavior like conditional program execution use conditional jump existence
In processor instruction change state bit
These flag used influence program behaves since often indicate outcome various operation
For example processor compare instruction evaluates two value set clear bit flag register indicate one greater whether equal one flag could used later jump instruction determine program flow
The first step fetch involves retrieving represented number sequence number program memory
The instruction location address program memory determined program counter PC store number identifies address next instruction fetched
After instruction fetched PC incremented length instruction contain address next instruction sequence
Often instruction fetched must retrieved relatively slow memory causing CPU stall waiting instruction returned
This issue largely addressed modern processor cache pipeline architecture see
The instruction CPU fetch memory determines CPU
In decode step performed circuitry known instruction converted signal control part CPU
The way instruction interpreted defined CPU instruction set architecture ISA
Often one group bit field within instruction called opcode indicates operation performed remaining field usually provide supplemental information required operation operand
Those operand may specified constant value called immediate value location value may memory address determined
In CPU design instruction decoder implemented hardwired unchangeable circuit
In others used translate instruction set CPU configuration signal applied sequentially multiple clock pulse
In case memory store microprogram rewritable making possible change way CPU decodes instruction
After fetch decode step execute step performed
Depending CPU architecture may consist single action sequence action
During action various part CPU electrically connected perform part desired operation action completed typically response clock pulse
Very often result written internal CPU register quick access subsequent instruction
In case result may written slower le expensive higher capacity
For example addition instruction executed ALU input connected pair operand source number summed ALU configured perform addition operation sum operand input appear output ALU output connected storage register memory receive sum
When clock pulse occurs sum transferred storage resulting sum large larger ALU output word size arithmetic overflow flag set
Hardwired CPU circuitry set basic operation perform called
Such operation may involve example adding subtracting two number comparing two number jumping different part program
Each basic operation represented particular combination known machine language executing instruction machine language program CPU decides operation perform decoding opcode
A complete machine language instruction consists opcode many case additional bit specify argument operation example number summed case addition operation
Going complexity scale machine language program collection machine language instruction CPU executes
The actual mathematical operation instruction performed circuit within CPU processor known ALU
In general CPU executes instruction fetching memory using ALU perform operation storing result memory
Beside instruction integer mathematics logic operation various machine instruction exist loading data memory storing back branching operation mathematical operation number performed CPU FPU
The control unit CPU contains circuitry us electrical signal direct entire computer system carry stored program instruction
The control unit execute program instruction rather directs part system
The control unit communicates ALU memory
The arithmetic logic unit ALU digital circuit within processor performs integer arithmetic operation
The input ALU data word operated called status information previous operation code control unit indicating operation perform
Depending instruction executed operand may come external memory may constant generated ALU
When input signal settled propagated ALU circuitry result performed operation appears ALU output
The result consists data word may stored register memory status information typically stored special internal CPU register reserved purpose
Most microprocessor desktop laptop server computer memory management unit translating logical address physical RAM address providing ability useful
Simpler processor especially usually include MMU
Most CPUs mean employ pace sequential operation
The clock signal produced external generates consistent number pulse second form periodic
The frequency clock pulse determines rate CPU executes instruction consequently faster clock instruction CPU execute second
To ensure proper operation CPU clock period longer maximum time needed signal propagate move CPU
In setting clock period value well possible design entire CPU way move data around edge rising falling clock signal
This advantage simplifying CPU significantly design perspective perspective
However also carry disadvantage entire CPU must wait slowest element even though portion much faster
This limitation largely compensated various method increasing CPU parallelism see
However architectural improvement alone solve drawback globally synchronous CPUs
For example clock signal subject delay electrical signal
Higher clock rate increasingly complex CPUs make difficult keep clock signal phase synchronized throughout entire unit
This led many modern CPUs require multiple identical clock signal provided avoid delaying single signal significantly enough cause CPU malfunction
Another major issue clock rate increase dramatically amount heat
The constantly changing clock cause many component switch regardless whether used time
In general component switching us energy element static state
Therefore clock rate increase energy consumption causing CPU require form solution
One method dealing switching unneeded component called involves turning clock signal unneeded component effectively disabling
However often regarded difficult implement therefore see common usage outside design
One notable recent CPU design us extensive clock gating IBM used way power requirement Xbox greatly reduced
Another method addressing problem global clock signal removal clock signal altogether
While removing global clock signal make design process considerably complex many way asynchronous clockless design carry marked advantage power consumption comparison similar synchronous design
While somewhat uncommon entire built without utilizing global clock signal
Two notable example compliant compatible MiniMIPS
Rather totally removing clock signal CPU design allow certain portion device asynchronous using asynchronous conjunction superscalar pipelining achieve arithmetic performance gain
While altogether clear whether totally asynchronous design perform comparable better level synchronous counterpart evident least excel simpler math operation
This combined excellent power consumption heat dissipation property make suitable
Every CPU represents numerical value specific way
For example early digital computer represented number familiar base value others employed unusual representation base three
Nearly modern CPUs represent number form digit represented physical quantity high low
Related numeric representation size precision integer number CPU represent
In case binary CPU measured number bit significant digit binary encoded integer CPU process one operation commonly called bit width data path width integer precision integer size
A CPU integer size determines range integer value directly operate
For example CPU directly manipulate integer represented eight bit range discrete integer value
Integer range also affect number memory location CPU directly address address integer value representing specific memory location
For example binary CPU us bit represent memory address directly address memory location
To circumvent limitation various reason CPUs use mechanism allow additional memory addressed
CPUs larger word size require circuitry consequently physically larger cost consume power therefore generate heat
As result smaller commonly used modern application even though CPUs much larger word size even available
When higher performance required however benefit larger word size larger data range address space may outweigh disadvantage
A CPU internal data path shorter word size reduce size cost
For example even though instruction set data path arithmetic logical unit add required four cycle one bit operand even though instruction set instruction set data path arithmetic logical unit add required two cycle
To gain advantage afforded lower higher bit length many different bit width integer data allowing CPUs implementing instruction set different bit width different portion device
For example IBM instruction set primarily bit supported value facilitate greater accuracy range floating point number
The Model adder decimal binary arithmetic adder arithmetic
Many later CPU design use similar mixed bit width especially processor meant usage reasonable balance integer floating point capability required
The description basic operation CPU offered previous section describes simplest form CPU take
This type CPU usually referred operates executes one instruction one two piece data time le one
This process give rise inherent inefficiency subscalar CPUs
Since one instruction executed time entire CPU must wait instruction complete proceeding next instruction
As result subscalar CPU get hung instruction take one clock cycle complete execution
Even adding second see improve performance much rather one pathway hung two pathway hung number unused transistor increased
This design wherein CPU execution resource operate one instruction time possibly reach performance one instruction per clock cycle
However performance nearly always subscalar le one instruction per clock cycle
Attempts achieve scalar better performance resulted variety design methodology cause CPU behave le linearly parallel
When referring parallelism CPUs two term generally used classify design technique Each methodology differs way implemented well relative effectiveness afford increasing CPU performance application
One simplest method used accomplish increased parallelism begin first step instruction fetching decoding prior instruction finish executing
This simplest form technique known utilized almost modern CPUs
Pipelining allows one instruction executed given time breaking execution pathway discrete stage
This separation compared assembly line instruction made complete stage exit execution pipeline retired
Pipelining however introduce possibility situation result previous operation needed complete next operation condition often termed data dependency conflict
To cope additional care must taken check sort condition delay portion occurs
Naturally accomplishing requires additional circuitry pipelined processor complex subscalar one though significantly
A pipelined processor become nearly scalar inhibited pipeline stall instruction spending one clock cycle stage
Further improvement upon idea instruction pipelining led development method decrease idle time CPU component even
Designs said include long instruction pipeline multiple identical
In superscalar pipeline multiple instruction read passed dispatcher decides whether instruction executed parallel simultaneously
If dispatched available execution unit resulting ability several instruction executed simultaneously
In general instruction superscalar CPU able dispatch simultaneously waiting execution unit instruction completed given cycle
Most difficulty design superscalar CPU architecture lie creating effective dispatcher
The dispatcher need able quickly correctly determine whether instruction executed parallel well dispatch way keep many execution unit busy possible
This requires instruction pipeline filled often possible give rise need superscalar architecture significant amount
It also make technique like crucial maintaining high level performance
By attempting predict branch path conditional instruction take CPU minimize number time entire pipeline must wait conditional instruction completed
Speculative execution often provides modest performance increase executing portion code may needed conditional operation completes
execution somewhat rearranges order instruction executed reduce delay due data dependency
Also case case lot data type modern processor disable part pipeline single instruction executed many time CPU skip fetch decode phase thus greatly increase performance certain occasion especially highly monotonous program engine video creation software photo processing
In case portion CPU superscalar part part suffers performance penalty due scheduling stall
The Intel two superscalar ALUs could accept one instruction per clock cycle FPU could accept one instruction per clock cycle
Thus integer superscalar floating point superscalar
Intel successor architecture added superscalar capability floating point feature therefore afforded significant increase floating point instruction performance
Both simple pipelining superscalar design increase CPU ILP allowing single processor complete execution instruction rate surpassing one instruction per clock cycle
Most modern CPU design least somewhat superscalar nearly general purpose CPUs designed last decade superscalar
In later year emphasis designing computer moved CPU hardware software interface
The strategy VLIW cause ILP become implied directly software reducing amount work CPU must perform boost ILP thereby reducing design complexity
Another strategy achieving performance execute multiple parallel
This area research known
In strategy known MIMD
One technology used purpose MP
The initial flavor technology known SMP small number CPUs share coherent view memory system
In scheme CPU additional hardware maintain constantly view memory
By avoiding stale view memory CPUs cooperate program program migrate one CPU another
To increase number cooperating CPUs beyond handful scheme NUMA introduced
SMP system limited small number CPUs NUMA system built thousand processor
Initially multiprocessing built using multiple discrete CPUs board implement interconnect processor
When processor interconnect implemented single chip technology known multiprocessing CMP single chip
It later recognized parallelism existed single program
A single program might several thread function could executed separately parallel
Some earliest example technology implemented processing separate thread computation thread
A general approach technology introduced system designed run multiple computation thread parallel
This technology known MT
This approach considered multiprocessing small number component within CPU replicated support MT opposed entire CPU case MP
In MT execution unit memory system including cache shared among multiple thread
The downside MT hardware support multithreading visible software MP thus supervisor software like operating system undergo larger change support MT
One type MT implemented known one thread executed stalled waiting data return external memory
In scheme CPU would quickly context switch another thread ready run switch often done one CPU clock cycle
Another type MT instruction multiple thread executed parallel within one CPU clock cycle
For several decade early focus designing high performance general purpose CPUs largely achieving high ILP technology pipelining cache superscalar execution execution etc
This trend culminated large CPUs Intel
By early CPU designer thwarted achieving higher performance ILP technique due growing disparity CPU operating frequency main memory operating frequency well escalating CPU power dissipation owing esoteric ILP technique
CPU designer borrowed idea commercial computing market aggregate performance multiple program also known computing important performance single thread process
This reversal emphasis evidenced proliferation dual core processor design notably Intel newer design resembling le superscalar architecture
Late design several processor family exhibit CMP including IBM well several CPUs like PowerPC design
A le common increasingly important paradigm processor indeed computing general deal data parallelism
The processor discussed earlier referred type scalar device
As name implies vector processor deal multiple piece data context one instruction
This contrast scalar processor deal one piece data every instruction
Using two scheme dealing data generally referred SIMD SISD respectively
The great utility creating processor deal vector data lie optimizing task tend require operation example sum performed large set data
Some classic example type task include application image video sound well many type engineering task
Whereas scalar processor must complete entire process fetching decoding executing instruction value set data vector processor perform single operation comparatively large set data one instruction
Of course possible application tends require many step apply one operation large set data
Most early vector processor associated almost exclusively scientific research application
However multimedia largely shifted digital medium need form SIMD processor become significant
Shortly inclusion started become commonplace processor specification implementation SIMD execution unit also began appear processor
Some early SIMD specification like HP MAX Intel
This proved significant impediment software developer since many application benefit SIMD primarily deal number
Progressively developer refined remade early design common modern SIMD specification usually associated one ISA
Some notable modern example include Intel also known VMX
involve subdividing CPU operation vCPUs
A host virtual equivalent physical machine virtual system operating
When several physical machine operating tandem managed whole grouped computing memory resource form
In system possible dynamically add remove cluster
Resources available host cluster level partitioned fine
The processor depends among many factor clock rate generally given multiple instruction per clock IPC together factor IPS CPU perform
Many reported IPS value represented peak execution rate artificial instruction sequence branch whereas realistic workload consist mix instruction application take longer execute others
The performance also greatly affect processor performance issue barely considered MIPS calculation
Because problem various standardized test often called developed attempt measure real effective performance commonly used application
Processing performance computer increased using essentially plugging two individual processor called sense one integrated circuit
Ideally dual core processor would nearly twice powerful single core processor
In practice performance gain far smaller due imperfect software algorithm implementation
Increasing number core processor
etc
increase workload handled
This mean processor handle numerous asynchronous event interrupt etc
take toll CPU overwhelmed
These core thought different floor processing plant floor handling different task
Sometimes core handle task core adjacent single core enough handle information
Due specific capability modern CPUs involve sharing actual CPU resource aiming increased utilization monitoring performance level hardware utilization gradually became complex task
As response CPUs implement additional hardware logic monitor actual utilization various part CPU provides various counter accessible software example Intel technology

Intel Core chip capability
Processor model ending K mean additional clock speed forced utilized time
mentioned earlier enables two thread processed per CPU core
This mean processor support four simultaneous thread since processor
Intel Core processor support mean work four thread time
processor however support technology therefore process thread time
Due power constraint inherent device continuous supply power product like smartphones tablet etc
desktop CPUs find balance performance power consumption
Neither clock speed simply number CPU core sole factor determining whether one CPU better another
It often depends type software run word application using CPU
One CPU may low clock speed processor another high clock speed processor
Deciding CPU would outperform depends entirely CPU used
For example function best multiple CPU core going work better multicore processor low clock speed would CPU high clock speed
Not software game even take advantage one two core making available CPU core pretty useless
Another component CPU cache
CPU cache like temporary holding place commonly used data
Instead calling random access memory item CPU determines data seem keep using assumes want using store cache
Cache faster using RAM physical part processor cache mean space holding information
Whether computer run operating system depends size data unit CPU handle
More memory accessed larger piece processor one application run processor
You see computer CPU detail along hardware information
Each motherboard support certain range CPU type always check motherboard manufacturer making purchase

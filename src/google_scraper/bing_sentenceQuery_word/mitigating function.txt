In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
Computer program consist thousand line code like textbook thousand word
In way textbook divided chapter program divided related functionality using
In textbook specific concept covered basis
Similarly computer program specific functionality divided named
Programs usually integrate block code module already created project
The program us implemented function procedure module
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
BBC Simon Lumb describes function used programming In computer program often section program want repeat
Chunks instruction given name called
Algorithms broken procedure function
This save time call function required instead type whole instruction set
Programming language set also known function procedure
If programmer make one
Functions differ procedure function return value unlike procedure
However passed procedure function
In program drawing shape program could ask user shape draw
The instruction drawing square could captured
The algorithm action could set task If computer program set instruction could given name sequence would executed calling
A function could calculate VAT due good sold
The algorithm function could If computer program set instruction could given name would executed running calling function
In example function would called using The function would return value VAT used elsewhere

A Function set action designed executed various time
This set action defined inside brace
Before set brace identifier
The identifier work like label saw goto
It allows computer later refer set action tell
Here general format function The identifier blue name give function
It follows saming naming convention variable name
All legal name valid
The element format explained go along
This format together called
Where supposed write function definition
Everything done written inside brace follow main
The function definition exception
You write main For example function named
Notice write main section This program may seem like anything special
We could written command main body program really needed write function
Well function show write function anything really useful
It show u structure function
If I wanted use function program I need function main
He example
Notice function written brace follow main
The line called
What tell computer jump function named action listed
Upon completing computer return main section program continues executing whatever command
Now completed overview function examine element function detail
We saw function format something called parameter list
Here blue In parameter list list piece information want function given parameter
Each parameter written exactly like variable declaration
So wanted function get integer parameter list would look like Notice parameter separated comma
Also notice even though I two ints I still need write word twice Let see implementation previously mentioned idea printing hello many time function told
If function one parameter function called many value parameter must sent
Each parameter assigned one value determined order variable
We seen call function pas value function
We also get value back function
This value get back stored variable function called
If function return value done called
Functions return one value
After function job value return placed exactly place function call written
Thus assuming function called myAverageFunction statement like If look definition function see general structure function something called
This define type value function return
If want function return value type write
If want function return value type write etc
Here example function whose return type blue defined float myAverageFunction int int b int c float average Defining function return specific type value first step
Next actually return value body function
See line green function actually return value defined return
When returning value use followed value wish return
This statement occurs inside function
In addition returning value return command also cause function exit
finish immediately
This true even statement written return command
For example myAverageFunction int int b int c float average Even function return value I theoretically choose store returned value
I let value drop
It though player would throw baseball back pitcher end play pitcher would watch fall ground
He let ball drop
In way function return value caller caller may may choose store value variable
For example I could call myAverageFunction like Functions also return nothing
In case function return
If I want write function return value I must declare function like If want write function without return value write word place return type like When I call function main I store return value since return value
I simply call function Some function like rand see programmer may write function I example
To must define function
That must define return value type intends return paramenters accept course function actually value receives called
A function defined according following format The value function return
It int float char etc
If function return value write
The parameter data input function
There ever one returned value number input
If multiple parameter seperated comma
Each parameter must composed type valid identifier
If function input leave parameter list blank write word parenthesis
Each parameter act variable used inside function
It though I defined several variable parameter list I use inside function
Here example function definition This function take parameter type int
It computes average number return value caller float
If calling function line like example Then would get value average number
Once I written function definitition I use function compute average many time I wish
Furthermore I use without worrying job
I treat function
The function call I try run function
To I simply write name function followed
Inside I place list value I want pas function parameter
This called function call
When I value I input assigned variable parameter list
The order list determines value assigned variable
The function able access value using variable defined parameter list
When call function value function
As I stated parameter list comma deliniated variable used input function
We many parameter input want
Although true variable defined locally
within function get equal value caller supply argument list
For example three parameter
All three ints
If I pas value call function like would get value b would get value c would get value
The order number determines value assigned variable
Furthermore function defined using parameter I must pas value whenever I call function
I ignore required input
It good idea write function start program function plan define
A function way telling compiler function plan define later
This useful one function using another function
The funtion look like first line function definition addition end
So need cut paste first line function definition top program file add
You permitted write function main function
This syntax style generally preferred
Here example trivial function function blue Ii general rule variable recognized inside block code defined
Thus variable defined within nested block code known outside inner nest
The hold true function
Variables defined inside one function known code function
So variable defined parameter list function known function nowhere else
It though parameter defined inside function brace
The variable defined function inside function known calling function variable defined calling function known called function
So called function get data input know calling function variable
It know variable name pas variable parameter list
When I call function copy value variable I pas sent function original variable
For example I call function like Let see example function attempt change variable outside scope
The function obviously succeed
If I want change variable I return new value output store variable main
Here example I could really change variable notice I changed function name exactly describe function One function may call another function
To simply call desired function within function would within main function
In order new function recognize funtion function definition must precede
The computer distinguishes different function based different name also based different parameter list
This mean create two function name different parameter computer consider function different function happen name
When call function compiler decide function mean checking many parameter passed
Depending parameter compiler decide function actually call
For example function defined two function different even though name
The first function one parameter second function two different function even though name
The inner working two function different night day quite similar
This depends programmer writes function definition two function
Usually function written similar operation since name supposed reflect function name
When function called compiler choose function definition match parameter supplied
For example I write second function called since second function two parameter
When programmer write different function name call function since function seems two different way working
Despite negative sound term nothing wrong function overloading
Another interesting feature function possibility providing default parameter
What mean call function missing parameter function provide value missing parameter
Let give example
Lets say I want write function compute circumference circle given radius
We know formula c Pi r c cirumference Pi value Pi r radius
I write function like float circum float radius float float total total Pi radius return total Now I call function one parameter assume parameter radius use value Pi I provide two parameter I call program use second value Pi place
This make sense example since person using function may want compute circumference circle using precise value Pi
Here example complete program There many function already written people used
These function grouped together stored called library
These different library group function somehow related
In library function like pwr raise something power sqrt find square root number
There also standard library many useful function
This library abreviated either stdlib cstdlib
One useful function library rand function
The rand function produce random number
Use like copy Nachum Danzig November November

We seen one function already output message
To use function always write name followed parenthesis
The word basically mean input function
Then function action depending argument
When multiple argument function separate comma
For example give multiple argument print order space separating
We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error
For example requires least one input It important carefully read error get back code work
Python usually give helpful feedback went wrong
However sometimes need look around little bit diagnose problem example
Python say syntax error mean ca understand trying This exercise using function
There connection city Maxime Miniac several bridge
There separate limit amount weight transported across bridge
In order drive along route truck need drive first bridge weight limit one weight limit one weight limit
Your truck crash overload three weight limit
Your code assume variable already contain bridge weight limit
Your truck take either route
Write program print maximum weight transported two city
Assume variable contain bridge weight limit
Here another code scramble must line rearrange correct program

Melanie taught several criminal justice course hold MS Sociology concentrating Criminal Justice completing Criminology Law Justice
Want watch later
If watched news lately nearly impossible heard story tragic event like mass shooting major robbery
We know people would sort thing yet still
If suspect survives incident brought justice may claim number reduce legal responsibility commission crime
The argument without factor present individual might committed crime thus given reduction penalty sentencing account factor
It judge presiding criminal case determine whether mitigating factor considered determining fate accused
It also important note factor remove blameworthiness accused meaning circumstance justify excuse accused defendant action
There many various mitigating factor considered court law individual accused committed crime
These factor must relevant commission crime order considered
Accordingly discus frequently used mitigating factor
If defendant minor role crime may considered
For instance tractor trailer driver found possession large amount drug offer proof knowledge presence play minor role crime
Alternatively armed robbery occurs individual merely passenger car weapon simply present commission crime would play minor role crime
Sometimes crime committed individual number mental illness way average mentally emotionally
In case court must weigh defendant mental status decision
Childhood circumstance may considered
If individual physically psychologically verbally sexually abused extended period time may le culpable crime
His ability restrain committing crime fully determine right wrong may impeded result abuse court weigh circumstance
Abuse substance often come court proceeding
The psychological power addiction may supersede rational thought ability make sound decision
Experts field substance addiction may weigh legal process
An offender may steal order provide family cash mean pay necessity bread milk
Naturally would include luxury item television stereo computer necessary sustain human life
Sometimes circumstance crime call extra attention
If esteemed trader Wall Street lost job hard day work trade made led investor losing million might head bar termination
When leaf bar go home highly intoxicated cause car accident event led drink could considered mitigating factor
The victim role victimization may function diminish culpability accused offender
In criminology also referred
The classic example two men involved bar fight
The man instigates fight Man actively participates assaulted Man
Man hit fashion dy injury
The defense could argue accused Man le culpable result victim role fight
Get FREE access day create account
If defendant previously committed crime past behavior also considered mitigating factor indicates criminal incident part pattern criminal offending
A court assessment character sometimes forgiving
One recent major case involved James Holmes convicted shooter Aurora Colorado movie theater shooting
Holmes defense team attempted plead guilty reason mental disease accepted defense judge
They claimed action result psychotic episode made le culpable crime
However sufficient evidence presented prosecution indicate action premeditated committed individual capable determining consequence action
The jury ultimately found Holmes guilty crime unanimously vote give death penalty
Thus life without parole became default sentence
Holmes received maximum penalty twelve life sentence year without parole prison
Mitigating factor used defense individual accused crime order diminish culpability blameworthiness individual
There numerous factor could argued mitigate culpability completely free accused responsibility crime
Some common factor lack criminal record childhood abuse substance addiction relative necessity playing minor role unusual circumstance
It judge presiding case determine whether factor considered determining fate accused
Nonetheless accused may still held fully responsible crime judge jury deems appropriate even presence mitigating factor

Random Early Detection RED widely used queue management mechanism router
We find parameter RED algorithm significant influence defense performance RED discus robust RED mitigating LDoS attack detail
Experiment result show defense performance RED effectively improved reasonable adjustment parameter
In end paper also give suggestion mitigating LDoS Attack
Keywords Mitigate Attack Defense Performance
Introduction Kuzmanovic Knightly proposed exploit TCP retransmission timeout mechanism followed RoQ attack Pulsing attack
The attack target router impact significant data transfer TCP flow TCP flow periodically enter retransmission timeout caused dropped packet
Moreover attack Border Gateway Protocol BGP use TCP transport protocol result serious influence internet
The router deploys queue management algorithm role algorithm impersonation whether algorithm counter attack
We make discussion defense performance queue management
In paper choose Random Early Detection RED focus
The RED algorithm variant widely used improve TCP performance
The basic idea RED queue management detect incipient congestion early convey congestion notification allowing reduce transmission rate queue network overflow packet dropped
The two threshold RED algorithm used keep steady queue length valuable launch LDoS attack
LDoS make use mechanism used network attack
The TCP congestion control mechanism get universal concern denial service attack
The LDoS attack touch TCP timeout retransmission mechanism router queue management algorithm shown
In paper TCP congestion control additive decrease algorithm
The sending window become half current value soon TCP timeout retransmission mechanism touched
Fig

TCP Timeout Mechanism In work study LDoS attack disrupt queue management algorithm today internet
Through analysis RED algorithm show principle attack make RED algorithm mitigate attack suitable setting parameter
The rest paper organized follows
We provide relate work LDoS attack RED algorithm
Section introduces simulation environment
We show robust RED algorithm mitigating LDoS attack section
In section give conclude paper

Related Work LDoS Attack The characteristic LDoS attack make average stream rate attack low long time let attack traffic subtle
The LDoS attack stream aggregation shown periodically sends short high pulse making attack stream periodically take router buffer reach maximum length queue resulting dropping packet causing affected legitimate TCP flow enter retransmission state
This eventually make significant reduction throughput achieve purpose attack
If rate aggregation router capacity traditional relationship two value
Fig

Attack Traffic Stream The LDoS attack two way launch
One way one attack node sends attack stream period known many attack node launch single attack MANLSA
The way every attack node sends attack stream period known many attack node launch cooperation attack MANLCA shown
In paper use MANLCA launch LDoS attack
Fig

Way launching LDoS Attack One way defend LDoS attack stochastic minimum retransmission timeout time value destroy consistent produced TCP retransmission timeout mechanism used preventing LDoS attack
But method must change internet protocol implemented
Most existing counter technology use behavior characteristic attack
The attack pulse make flow packet arriving rate significant increment short time Kuzmanovic proposed let queue management algorithm router drop packet flow high rate order mitigate attack
Sarat S proposed moderate increase buffer size Stanford model render shrew ineffective make attack need send faster fill buffer longer make detect easy
HAWK calculate strength attack flow attack burst time attack period upgrade existing queue management algorithm realize filter periodically high rate short flow
The RRED algorithm us principle counter attack
The three method meet problem LDoS attack launched MANLCA method may lose result
According influence throughput Sun H proposed distribute detection algorithm
Compared value power spectrum density PSD attack normal Chen Yu developed distributed collaborative detection CDF scheme detect segregate attack legitimate traffic
Details RED The basic idea RED queue management detect incipient congestion early convey congestion notification allowing reduce transmission rate queue network overflow packet dropped
The probability arrived packet dropped computed follows The RED two threshold queue
average length queue weight current length queue calculating max value probability packet dropped probability arrived packet dropped number packet dropped
It easy find bigger value larger probability drop arriving packet
During burst length time one period suppose denotes maximum length bottleneck queue shared TCP flow attack traffic stream b denotes number arrived attack packet c denotes number arrived TCP packet denotes number packet transferred router
The max time first packet dropped router calculated
Suppose denotes number attack stream given rate attack stream node size attack packet given number packet attack stream send attack period computeed
So know smaller size attack packet larger number attack packet le time bigger number
After time queue reach maximum length
And queue remains state time
The attack impact TCP flow
In order mitigate attack must make value large
The latter type reach make value large larger better
In attack value keep steady must let value increase
This mean need drop le packet let value decrease
The way increase value decrease value
In paper focus change impact attack value change
Also know size attack packet usually small use average flow calculate probability drop arrived packet

Simulations Settings We use simulation environment build simulation network based
In Figure normal TCP connection FTP data
attack traffic stream CBR simulate attack traffic
The maximum length queue denoted default value attack packet size Bytes
Fig

Network Topology The retransmission timeout mechanism two important parameter
We employ TCP protocol default value two parameter set
From get propagation delay queue setting set value RTT varies satisfies
In following experiment first start retransmission timeout
Since LDoS attack impact TCP flow normal connection default represent TCP flow
Metric Under normal circumstance packet totally sent TCP
In case attack number
So defense performance RED algorithm described follow definition
Definition The best defense performance
The attack effect TCP connection best case
The worst defense performance
In best case affected TCP connection get service

Experimental Results Analysis Here discus different value impact defense performance RED setting value achieve higher defense performance RED algorithm
While parameter RED algorithm use default value
The parameter attack traffic stream including Attack Period attack rate burst length
According set
And based way attack compute attack rate attack period determined experiment
Attack Period In order get accurate conclusion discus case four different number attack traffic stream different setting relationship
Because best attack period regularly range make experiment range order choose best attack period
The result shown Fig
respectively
Fig

Attack Period From Fig
know different value best attack period different shown Table
We also see increase best attack period becomes
This good conclusion defense performance still good enough attack launched using different number attack traffic stream
An important conclusion increase defense performance RED becomes good effectively counter LDoS attack
Table Best Attack Period Fixed different impact RED From section know increase defense performance RED becomes good
Especially value reach defense performance RED good
But whether special case case defense performance good make experiment
In case fixed value different range
The result shown
Fig

Defense Performance We see value different value make little impact defense performance improved reduced defense performance still good
The big distance best worst defense performance
In setting defense performance better distance best worst performance lower setting
Because RED algorithm need consider steadiness queue must set based need queue management
Size Attack Packet From experiment know three pair make RED algorithm good defense performance
But attacker change size attack packet order worse performance
Whether defense performance RED still better discus different size attack packet impact defense performance RED algorithm section case attack rate aggregation burst length fixed respectively
The value different value three occasion
show larger size larger number attack stream better defense performance
If rate attack traffic stream aggregation number attack stream number packet attack stream sending computed fllows interval two contious packet
In experiment section value fixed variable parameter
The result shown Fig

If fixed larger le number attack packet larger interval time better defense perfomance
Fig

Different value packet size Attack rate In experiment compute attack rate also know set defense performance RED good
But attacker increase attack rate order reduce defense performance
Whether defense performance sensitive increase attack rate discus
The value Bytes respectively
We also consider set three case
The result shown Fig

From three figure get conclusion increase attack rate different number attack traffic stream show different trend
If attacker make four attack traffic stream defense performance soon reduce rapidly increase attack rate defense performance may sensitive attack rate case attack traffic stream
In case attack rate reach aggregation distance defense performance becomes largest
But increase attack rate packet interval time becomes small
The interval time two continuous used counter LDoS attack precondition attack use IP Spoofing technology
Fig


Fig

The thing find different value attack rate impact defense performance number attack traffic stream
Therefore set representative case
Different value maximum length In experiment defense performance RED weighed case queue length size buffer determined
If maximum length queue different whether conclusion true discus section
Fig
illustrates different length queue impact defense RED
case fixed buffer size variable value b case buffer size value use default value
The relationship
Fig

Buffer Size Impacts Defense Performance From see size buffer fixed increase defense performance RED improves reach large enough
So know buffer size choose suitable value order counter LDoS attack
b show size buffer change value
In case range defense performance RED improves
In case range defense performance reduces still good
So effectively counter LDoS attack suitable value
Different capability bottleneck link In case bottleneck link capability make experiment
If capability bottleneck link change order effectively counter LDoS attack set parameter RED make discus section
So make four group experiment result shown
Fig

Defense Performance Suppose capability bottleneck link value maximum length queue
Based conclusion make RED good defense performance
The maximum length queue determined buffer size determined
The four group experiment made unfixed length queue unfixed buffer size unfixed length queue fixed buffer size fixed length queue unfixed buffer size fixed length queue fixed buffer size respectively
The buffer size fixed mean buffer size increase along increase capability bottleneck link
The unfixed length queue mean queue maximum length
From know increase bottleneck link capability increase buffer size change queue length limit defense performance becomes poor
And also get occasion defense performance always good increase bottleneck link capability
With fixed buffer size changed queue length limit defense performance sensitive bottleneck link capability

Conclusion In paper discus robust RED countering LDoS attack
Through experiment get conclusion suitable set maximum length queue value effectively improve defense performance RED mitigate LDoS attack
The relationship
We also give suggestion setting queue different capability bottleneck link
The little change RED algorithm let algorithm good defense performance make easy implement

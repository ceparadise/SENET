Preventive maintenance PM fundamental planned maintenance activity designed improve equipment life avoid unplanned maintenance activity
This maintenance includes Preventive maintenance foundation entire maintenance strategy
Unless PM program effective subsequent maintenance strategy take longer implement incur higher cost higher probability failure
Preventive maintenance aim In addition preventive maintenance measure drastically reduce error operation well increase overall preparedness plant case emergency
The ideal preventive maintenance program would prevent equipment failure occur
Preventive maintenance goal improving equipment life preventing excess depreciation impairment
This maintenance includes limited In preventive maintenance equipment repaired serviced failure occur
The frequency maintenance activity predetermined schedule
Expensive failure consequence indicate need greater level preventive maintenance
Components essentially inspected corrosion damage planned interval order identify corrective action failure actually occur
Preventive maintenance performed regular interval usually result reduced failure rate
Due varying need different operation type amount preventive maintenance required varies greatly
Therefore extremely difficult establish successful preventive maintenance program without proper guideline instruction
The ANSI standard preventive maintenance help determine type frequency inspection maintenance procedure

Once failure happens repair costly
There preventive measure take decrease likelihood computer problem
The average computer user think much problem arise computer failure actually occurs system
Once failure happens repair costly
The good news preventive measure take decrease likelihood running problem computer smooth efficient operation also lessen damage occur despite best effort avoid failure
Computer failure occur variety reason sometimes human error sometimes factor environment cause computer malfunction combination
These factor include excessive buildup dust heat magnetism picked storage medium shared different computer static electricity shock power surge carelessness spilling liquid computer bumping dropping casing configured correctly PC handled incorrectly incorrect handling
The following tip basic guideline use keep PC maintained run efficiently increase component lifespan also help lessen overall likelihood PC failure Stay date latest development Internet terminology free weekly newsletter Webopedia

Take good care PC take good care
It nice sentiment reality like Take good care PC wo crash lose data cost job probably
Follow step stop PC problem stop
Your PC two mortal enemy heat moisture
Excess heat accelerates deterioration delicate circuit system
The common cause overheating dust dirt Clogged vent CPU cooling fan keep air moving case even thin coating dust dirt raise temperature machine component
Any grime especially residue cigarette smoke corrode exposed metal contact
That pay keep system clean inside
If PC resides relatively clean environment annual cleaning sufficient
But location dusty office shop floor system may need cleaning every month
All need wipe compressed air drop mild cleaning solution Formula Simple Green bowl water antistatic wrist strap protect system clean inside case
Before get started cleaning check around PC anything nearby could raise temperature heating duct sunshine coming window
Also clear away anything might fall make dirty bookcase houseplant
Always turn unplug system clean component
Never apply liquid directly component
Spray pour liquid cloth wipe PC cloth
Wipe case clear ventilation port obstruction
Compressed air great blow dust PC optical floppy drive
Keep cable firmly attached connector case
When nonoptical mouse get dirty pointer move erratically
Unscrew ring bottom unit remove ball
Then scrape accumulated gunk two plastic roller set degree apart inside ball housing
Turn keyboard upside shake clear crumb key
If suffice blast briefly compressed air
If key stick keyboard really dirty pry key easier cleaning
Computer shop special tool removing key also pop using two pencil broken tip jumbo tweezer sure use soft touch
Wipe monitor case clear vent obstruction without pushing dust unit
Clean screen standard glass cleaner cloth
If monitor degauss button look small magnet icon push clear magnetic interference
Many LCDs cleaned isopropyl alcohol check LCD manufacturer
Wipe LCD lightly The underlying glass fragile
Reseat cable plugged surge protector
Check unit warning indicator one
Surge protector may power PC even compromised voltage spike making system susceptible second spike
If power protector warning indicator area suffers frequent power outage replace one indicator UL certified
Gently wipe disc moistened soft cloth
Use motion start center disc move outward toward edge
Never wipe disc circular motion

Schedule preventive maintenance based timeline usage
Images Although might able record saving gain effective preventive maintenance computer machinery vehicle building safe bet expenditure well worth cost
In addition following manufacturer suggested maintenance procedure take account specific use asset create effective preventive maintenance strategy business
The first step creating preventive maintenance strategy listing asset deteriorate time use
A good place start accounting staff asking list asset depreciates year
Discuss major purchase especially come warranty purchasing team
Do office exterior building
Meet expert computer building auto machinery maintenance help create preventive maintenance program
This often mean contacting company sold asset
Ask maintenance service contract company offer look online review sign contract avoid unnecessary service
For example many automobile service company recommend changing vehicle oil every mile many auto manufacturer recommend oil change mile
Discuss regular service well tip maintaining asset
Schedule annual building inspection qualified inspector
Create guideline inspecting asset might include schedule based date hour used mile driven
Have use asset maintain check regular basis
For example teach computer user turn monitor hard drive perform backup run diagnostics program
Restaurants often require shift clean kitchen leaving next shift inspect previous shift work
Develop checklist worker update manually inspection work memory
Have sign date inspection report
In addition scheduling inspection maintenance perform predictive maintenance exercise creating chart show problem might occur based company use asset
Use owner manual warranty practical knowledge asset use set alert time inspect
In addition asset user perform basic maintenance computer machine auto designate one employee lead person responsible maintenance entire class asset including reviewing individual maintenance performance staff member responsible asset
For example designate one information technology staff member responsible maintaining computer inspecting computer also maintenance log use habit user
Designate fleet manager auto shop manager review maintenance log regular basis

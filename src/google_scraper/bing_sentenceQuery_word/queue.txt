In particular kind entity collection kept order principle operation collection addition entity rear terminal position known removal entity front terminal position known
This make queue
In FIFO data structure first element added queue first one removed
This equivalent requirement new element added element added removed new element removed
Often operation also entered returning value front element without dequeuing
A queue example abstractly sequential collection
Queues provide service various entity data object person event stored held processed later
In context queue performs function
Queues common computer program implemented data structure coupled access routine language class
Common implementation
Theoretically one characteristic queue specific capacity
Regardless many element already contained new element always added
It also empty point removing element impossible new element added
Fixed length array limited capacity true item need copied towards head queue
The simple trick turning array closed circle letting head tail drift around endlessly circle make unnecessary ever move item stored array
If n size array computing index modulo n turn array circle
This still conceptually simplest way construct queue high level language admittedly slow thing little array index must compared zero array size comparable time taken check whether array index bound language certainly method choice quick dirty implementation high level language pointer syntax
The array size must declared ahead time implementation simply double declared array size overflow occurs
Most modern language object implement come library dynamic list
Such may specified fixed capacity limit besides memory constraint
Queue result trying add element onto full queue queue happens trying remove element empty queue
A queue limited fixed number item
There several efficient implementation FIFO queue
An efficient implementation one perform
Queues may implemented separate data type may considered special case deque implemented separately
For example allow pushing popping array end one use function enqueue dequeue list reverse one use although case operation efficient
provides templated class restricted operation
Since Java library contains interface specifies queue operation implementing class include since
PHP class third party library like
A simple queue implemented Queues also implemented
Two version implementation exists
The first one called presented allows queue operation O time requires list
The second one lazy list memoization presented end section
Its time persistency used complexity number element queue
Let u recall list denotes length represents empty list represents list whose head whose tail
The data structure used implement queue consists three front queue rear queue reverse order
The invariant structure rear without first element
The tail queue almost inserting element almost
It said almost result
An auxiliary function must called invariant satisfied
Two case must considered depending whether empty list case
The formal definition followed reversed
Let u call function return followed reversed
Let u furthermore assume since case function called
More precisely define lazy function take input three list return concatenation reversed
Then
The inductive definition rotate
Its running time since lazy evaluation used computation delayed result forced computation
The list data structure two purpose
This list serf counter indeed empty list
This counter allows u ensure rear never longer front list
Furthermore using tail force computation part lazy list operation
Therefore list totally forced
If case internal representation could append append append forcing would constant time operation anymore
Note without lazy part implementation queue would implementation queue time
In case list replaced integer reverse function would called

An array data structure element accessed directly constant time
A typical illustration random access book page book open independently others
Random access critical many algorithm example binary search
A linked list data structure element accesed particular order
A typical illustration sequential access roll paper tape prior material must unrolled order get data want
In note consider subcase sequential data structure data sturctures
A stack data structure
Here structural definition Stack Once reach dead end must backtrack
But backtrack
previous choice point
Therefore choice point store stack possible choice
Then backtracking simply mean popping next choice stack
Another implementation requirement addition interface stack operation must run
Constant time mean constant k operation take k nanosecond computational time regardless stack size
In stack abstraction capacity stay unchanged therefore reach stack object throw exception
See complete implementation stack class
In dynamic stack abstraction reach double stack size
See complete implementation stack class
The difference stack queue removing
In stack remove item recently added queue remove item least recently added
Each basic operation must run constant time O
The following picture demonstrates idea implementation composition
However free space front index
We shall use space enqueueing new item
next entry stored index
Such model called Finally reach queue full
There two choice handle full queue throw exception b double array size
The circular queue implementation done using modulo operator denoted computed taking remainder division example
By using modulo operator view queue circular array wrapped around simulated back
In addition back front index maintain another index counting number element queue
Having index simplifies logic implementation
See complete implementation circular queue
The simplest two search technique known Search DFS Search BFS
These two search described looking search tree representing possible path start traversed
In search go path get dead end back popping stack get alternative path
In search explore nearest possibility finding possible successor enqueue queue
We see search technique later course
Typically deal expression infix notation Now describe convert infix postfix
We describe parse evaluate postfix expression

What practical application Queues Computer Science
Where use
I heard use Video Games Computer Simulation program true
Why
Apart two area practical application Queues data structure
Queues used situation want efficiently maintain order entity
These situation arise literally every type software development
Imagine serf file thousand user
You service request handle say
A fair policy would serve serve time order arrival
A Queue would definitely appropriate data structure
Similarly multitasking operating system CPU run job job must batched scheduled according policy
Again queue might suitable option case
Stacks used undo button various software
The recent change pushed stack
Even back button browser work help stack recently visited web page pushed stack
Queues used case printer uploading image
Where first one entered first processed
I use queue prioritise replying SO question
I tried multiprocessing made complete hash
All kind system request job client processed one handler incoming item stored queue handler free pop new item queue start processing
This pattern used web server among others
See
In shallowest search graph would use queue store node discover
Typical us queue simulation operating system
Our software queue counterpart real world queue
We wait queue buy pizza enter movie theater drive turnpike ride roller coaster
Another important application queue data structure help u simulate analyze real world queue
Algorithms strongly tight together So usually using Queue depends Algorithm manipulate Stack Enqueuing Dequeuing Which turn
depends application For example making application accept input multiple user server First Come First Service basis mean app serve first request First instead every time check time stamp request see oldest Enqueue incoming request stack Dequeue Stack every time see next request Say number document printed
Your OS put doc queue sends printer
The printer take print document order doc put queue ie First In First Out
In situation multiple user networked computer system probably share printer user
When request print file request added print queue
When request reach front print queue file printed
This ensures one person time access printer access given basis
computer comilation made FIRST IN FIRST OUT FIFO line compile first n result print first QUEUE
Queues using first first concept FIFO
The first job arrive first processed

OS queue document printing queue printer print first document arrive give output Queues also used implement Breadth First Search algorithm traverse vertex Graph reached start vertex
information Game Application Algorithms explore maze interconnected room use queue keep track option yet explored Printer hold process
In CPU scheduling
As page replacement policy FIFO
There many real life example may help better understanding queue
For example wherever use queue get give anything

Queue Definition A data structure used sequence multiple demand resource printer processor communication channel
Objects added tail queue taken head
Search Queue UK US Search Queue rest Computing Students

In computer science priority queue abstract data type like regular queue stack data structure additionally element priority associated
In priority queue element high priority served element low priority
If two element priority served according order queue

Using python data structure implement queue function enqueue dequeue peek isEmpty
We assume know name queue

To line
In refers lining
For example want print number special print queue document placing special area called The pull document queue one time
Another term
The order job queue depends priority system used
Most commonly job executed order placed queue scheme certain job given higher priority
A group job waiting executed
In queue element removed order entered
This often referred FIFO first first
In contrast data structure element removed reverse order entered
This referred LIFO last first

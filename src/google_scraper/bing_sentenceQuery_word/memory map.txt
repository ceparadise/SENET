The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A memory map massive table effect comprises complete information structured computer system
A memory map work something like gigantic office organizer
In map computer unique memory reserved especially data inadvertently overwrite corrupt
In order computer function properly operating system must always able access right part memory right time
When computer first start memory map tell OS much memory available
As computer run memory map ensures data always written read proper place
The memory map also ensures computer resolve memory address actual stored data
If memory map existing memory map got corrupted OS might probably would write data read data wrong place
As result data read would always pertain appropriate file
The problem would likely start small unnoticeable worsen time become apparent considerable damage done stored data program
In end application would fail run many critical data file would ruined

In structure data usually resides memory indicates laid
Memory map different meaning different part operating system
It fastest flexible cache organization us
The associative memory store address content memory word
In memory map passed order instruct memory layout
It contains information regarding size total memory reserved region may also provide detail specific architecture
In implementation memory map refers store mapping certain process virtual memory layout space relates physical memory address
In native program memory map refers mapping loaded file memory region
These memory map used resolve actual symbol
The PC BIOS provides set routine used operating system get memory layout
Some available routine This BIOS interrupt call used running OS get memory size configuration
It supported AMI BIOSses dated August later
The operating system set AX call int
If error happened routine return CF Carry Flag set
If error routine return CF clear state register described following Input SMAP buffer structure How used The operating system shall allocate SMAP buffer memory byte buffer
Then set register specified Input table
On first call EBX set
Next step call INT
If error interrupt call return CF clear buffer filled data representing first region memory map
EBX updated BIOS OS call routine The next region returned buffer
BIOS set EBX zero done

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
This question concern hardware software
Basically citing article memory map say In computer science memory map structure data usually resides memory indicates memory laid
Source There extreme ambiguity regard opening sentence
First RAM know lay memory CPU address space purpose RAM depends system
Second RAM changed
If data resides RAM RAM chip hardwired structure describing memory
That make sense scope CPU vague make even le sense look scope RAM system different memory time different hardware different address different architecture etc
Third article claim memory map passed firmware OS
That would make sense RAM hardwired map synchronous CPU address space
Basically I clueless lost
I understand way make clear sense
RAM map address system knowledge system structure
In computer science memory map structure data usually resides memory indicates memory laid
Source There extreme ambiguity regard opening sentence
First RAM know lay memory address space purpose RAM depends system
Normally memory map saved kind memory device load memory map system boot
As someone using device although layout le relevant system running operating system since becomes OS job control memory access
The DIY approach usually required embedded system physically connecting IC existing circuit
Moving computer system Second RAM changed
If data resides RAM RAM chip hardwired structure describing memory
That make sense scope CPU vague make even le sense look scope RAM system different memory time different hardware different address different architecture etc
Third article claim memory map passed firmware OS
That would make sense RAM hardwired map synchronous CPU address space
Exactly RAM provides determine RAM system changed since last time computer started
Also memory management unit come support use operating system
The MMU bridge physica hardwired RAM layout large number line connected DIMMs motherboard abstracted away CPU even MMU CPU die logically two different unit
RAM map address system knowledge system structure
You correct RAM profile identify resource available system every time start computer
Furthermore process abstracted away anything operating system since use separate concept system memory physical RAM people familiar concept OS place part process memory free RAM application
The article say In boot process memory map passed firmware order instruct operating system kernel memory layout
It contains information regarding size total memory reserved region may also provide detail specific architecture
And say The PC BIOS provides set routine used operating system get memory layout
Some available routine This BIOS interrupt call used running OS get memory size configuration To answer first question
The article mention nothing cpu address space easy even find term used internet
CPUs register cpu memory location like big space need map kind index find thing
And term CPU even occur anywhere article linked
The article say RAM GETS info elsewhere system RAM
It get BIOS BIOS us CMOS memory battery power set BIOS setup find thing automatically
And possibly memory map flexible aspect new thing loaded
But RAM start without memory map put
That answer second question
And third question got wrong article say memory map passed firmware NO
It say opposite firmware RAM RAM firmware
The basic program BIOS would firmware
But store data changed
And additional note There something called DDR RAM us send data BIOS request mentioned rather advanced article SPD mentioned
I configured BIOS system said get RAM detail SPD enter manually
one could overclock RAM
No memory map something basic like speed meant run stuff SPD get mentioned article
Other thing BIOS manually entered data
And view memory map Really old Apple II computer minimum RAM DIP switch set added
During position switch read memory map setup accordingly
Early IBM PC system also DIP switch minimum RAM
The memory map listed various thing like content display disk buffer etc located memory address range RAM
So least memory map know minimum amount RAM known location
Some memory used store memory map information used code detects rest build full memory map
Modern system lot DIP switch using thing like SPD chip RAM module find size layout basic
Some minmum amount memory know location
There definitely confusion happening mostly due fact article trying pack various different related thing one place
There two primary type completely different thing using name
What seeing regard BIOS hardware really called
This memory laid used
In context certain part memory assigned used different thing
This map usually exist tangible way hardware napkin whiteboard diagram designer come implement using array index
Another usage term regard
In case map list OS us keep track part memory assigned program part memory free
Because different program allocate free chunk memory indeterminate pattern memory get fragmented like file various size created deleted
Since memory get fragmented OS simply hand chunk memory requested size every program come along
There free block different size surrounded used block
To know big free block keep memory mark used free whenever allocates release memory program
This map like figure even see tool like figure
The specific layout used visualization may vary example show drive show memory design choice
This allocation map literal map actually array stored memory
When come BIOS hardware also term refers mapping part hardware device memory read write device simply reading writing memory address like would access normal memory
However even different usage term thus add confusion
In context mean rather like mathematical mapping one thing assigned something else

Memory Map In available

The performance CPU affected number core clock speed memory
There different type volatile memory
Computers require input hardware processing hardware output hardware
The hardware defines computer
Without computer could function
The CPU memory work together run program
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
Most computer CPU separate graphic processing unit GPU image
The GPU around time faster CPU
It optimised produce graphic game film
The GPU responsible handling image free CPU task
CPU memory speed affect overall speed computer
If one significantly slower slow others
test used ass performance computer
Different type benchmark software used different kind application might want computer
It difficult ass performance CPU computer might excel task well others
For example computer going used gaming require best combination hardware handle intensive graphic quickly
The computer might perform well used analyse vast amount scientific data

In computer science two definition word map
The first associative array type container map value one type value another type
An example
The second definition functional programming map applies function take list function applies function element list order return list result
What origin different definition map
I guessing second definition might come I sure derived another useful
The first definition make intuitive sense I sure came
Both construct define map mathematical sense mapping element one set another
Well mathematical meaning pairing element one set another

Computer physical device capable storing information temporarily permanently
For example Random Access Memory volatile memory store information used
Below example picture MB DIMM computer
This memory module connects computer
Memory either memory
memory loses content computer hardware device loses power
Computer RAM example volatile memory computer freeze reboots working program lose anything saved
sometimes abbreviated NVRAM memory keep content even power lost
example memory
As mentioned memory RAM volatile memory computer loses power anything stored RAM lost
For example working creating document stored RAM saved memory hard drive would lost computer lost power
It common new computer user confused part computer memory
Although RAM memory appropriate refer RAM memory hard drive
When someone asks much memory computer often GB Random Access Memory RAM several hundred gigabyte even hard disk drive storage
In word always hard drive space RAM
When program Internet open loaded hard drive placed RAM allows program communicate processor higher speed
Anything save computer picture video sent hard drive storage
All device computer operate speed computer memory give computer place quickly access data
If CPU wait secondary storage device like hard disk drive computer would much slower
Some common type memory chip computer listed
These type memory fall general category


Memory GCSE Computer Science Revision
Everyone benefit good memory
Right
You study math exam remember fact figure ready big day
You remember time
You even remember take pen
You remember fact figure write dazzling paper examiner stunned dazzling math skill give distinction
What kind memory get computer system
How work store data
Firstly let talk volatile memory memory
Volatile memory relies power source store information rather like needing concentrate fact sink
If pay attention class really bad memory fact go one ear remember thing
It volatile memory
As soon switch information lost
memory remains place even power switched
So instance could concentrating class take everything remember
When get home learned class reinforces knowledge stuffed inside head even go sleep switch something else like go dancing play football memory fact still retrieve
The third type memory called virtual memory
A computer system might using set allocation random access memory RAM need run another programme enough RAM
The computer grind halt tell enough space run extra programme would kindly shut one programme want continue
That problem need programme running
So system access extra space another part computer system copy hard drive
What concept transferring space
But give virtual memory run extra programme

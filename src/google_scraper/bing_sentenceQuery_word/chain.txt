This question little like asking color better red green
I dont mean antagonizing rude
I really dont
But subjective question
There answer
It depends like best
They benefit
Some hate engineering hate supply chain job others hate programming software computer science job
You might want articulate question little something trying ask
Its
Its way would find better
Momma dig ditch life might well I see mostly work value meaning make
Pay physical work load intellectual challenge section larger industry compared others thing
There equivalent every industry
Some company terrific staff treat folk really well le money Some pay much expect able push pretty hard money
Supply Chain get dimensional thing also virtual side done clean hand
Personally Pick Major Minor dual major according preference integrate
Anyone integrates multiple discipline well almost always worth bunch money employer
overhaul likely Ocean side cargo movement potential drone cargo implies huge investment support supply chain
Best fortune decision
EDIT corrected spelling good
Knowing one better depends inherent strength
Plus need specific
Engineering cover job
Computer Science cover job
Supply Chain cover job
You need drill determine area curio
Engineering Supply Chain go hand hand
An engineer make great supply chain professional
But literally thousand job within domain
If like hardware engineer
If like software focus computer science I know computer science cover hardware point If love process focus supply chain
Either way building stuff
And building stuff fun
Still question

I currently reading paper Markov chain lumping I failing see difference Markov chain plain directed weighted graph
For example article provide following definition CTMC continuous time Markov chain We consider finite CTMC S Q state space S transition rate matrix Q S S R
They mention Markov property fact weight edge represents probability I believe Markov property trivially hold since probability depends current state chain path lead
In article Markov chain defined similarly A Markov chain M represented triplet S P S finite set state M P transition probability matrix indicating probability getting one state another initial probability distribution representing likelyhood system start certain state
Again mention past future independence
There third paper never state weight edge probability even say In many application value W
We make assumption however also application W deliberately chosen S making usually negative
Moreover stated lumping way reduce number state maintaining Markov property aggregating equivalent state bigger state
Yet look like simply summing probability even guarantee resulting peobabilities transition aggregated state range
What lumping actually preserve
So two possibility I see Could someone clarify situation
It really look like different community using term mean widely different thing
From article I considering look like Markov property either trivial useless looking different kind paper look fundamental
A represented directed graph constant edge weight
An equivalent representation constant directed graph N node N N matrix
The future state depend current state constant edge weight constant entry matrix
mean
Mathematicians use euphemism meaning prove
But first paper defines notation consistent Markov Chain sometimes called second paper defines notation consistent Markov Chain
They say P indicating probability getting one state another representing likelihood system start certain state
emphasis added They assuming matrix constant time thus implying Markov property
Implicit term fact constant range entry every column P sum sum entry sum
I ca read third paper paywalled
If entry every column matrix required sum probability talking Markov Chains
If entry every column sum arbitrary number entry represent probability talking Markov Chains
Markov Chains Markov Chains
In Markov Chain edge weight represent probability rather
The edge weight must arbitrarily large weight sum number
The sum required
With Markov Chains Markov property implied constant edge weight equivalently constant entry transition matrix
Markov Chains come two flavor continuous time discrete time
Both continuous time markov chain CTMC discrete time markov chain DTMC represented directed weighted graph
For DTMC transition always take one unit time
As result choice weight arc put probability going j given
For CTMC transition time two state necessarily given exponential random variable
This key difference CTMC DTMC DTMC always unit transition time
CTMC random transition time
For CTMC convention generally put weight arc according rate exponential random variable going source destination
That convention put arc probability
Although CTMC I recall represented positive rate edge negative rate come CTMC analysis
Say standing state A connected B C D
A B rate A B negative A C rate A C negative D A rate A D positive This likely quite paper referring I bring show negative weight necessarily ridiculous someone working suitable convention
For right
The markov property satisfied trivially
For CTMC markov property satisfied transition given exponential random variable memoryless
If transition given exponential random variable say instead uniform would talking Chains Processes

Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
technique efficiently sampling complicated probability distribution
No matter discrete probability distribution set markov chain distribution distribution wish sample
You approximate distribution simulating random walk markov chain
If happens small empirical distribution simulation quickly converge steady state distribution giving efficient algorithm sampling
An important application essentially assume underlying random distribution follows Markov chain
One exiting application HMMs bioinformatics
The task consume long million symbol DNA sequence predict important part gene located
One approach using Hidden Markov Model trained model certain distribution
A related concise problem detecting unfair die used casino
Assume game master switch fair unfair dice certain probability p every roll
This modelled like States probability die roll state every number emitted probability state something different happens
All probability trained either using observed relative count access roll history die used using instance
For given sequence die roll used obtain likely underlying path emits sequence path read unfair die likely used
If online guess unfair die used exploit knowledge
Markov chain appear everywhere
Why
Because model general You interested large set object handle local manipulation object eg
modifying object slightly get new one
You want study global property set object approximate size
This natural problem abstraction problem many field modeled random walk graph node object interest
Starting arbitrary node elementary step move neighboring node certain say uniform neighbor probability
This simple elementary step applied many time result wonderful distribution node converges limiting distribution depending structure graph arbitrary node started
This limiting distribution tell u lot global property set object interest size structure graph
The time take convergence mixing time thus crucial importance algorithmic modeling application
One active field probability theoretical computer science analysis Markov chain various application
Many clever beautiful mathematical tool developed analyze mixing time various case
In nutshell Markov chain used model correlated stochastic process broad class signal
If value signal moment well approximated function signal value limited number preceding moment Markov model appropriate

Rachel taught field Forensic Science Criminal Justice year master degree Forensic Science Imagine crime scene specialist investigating homicide
During investigation find drop blood floor near doorway leading away victim body
This could definitely important evidence need collected
How go
If blood end critical case testify court collected
You explain found collected swear oath swab presented court one collected
The trial might take place month even year
How sure evidence tracked logged protected tampering
The process documenting collecting protecting evidence called establishing
Creating maintaining chain custody mean detailed log kept evidence found logging anything happens evidence prior trial
For lesson let follow documentation collection packaging process blood homicide investigation
You see different step required creating maintaining chain custody come crime scene evidence
Chain custody always begin crime scene specialist professional conducting crime scene investigation
When evidence first found crime scene step taken document evidence found
This usually done crime scene photograph note taken initial investigation
Most police agency crime lab label item evidence number located
In picture investigator labeled crowbar item photographing place
This usually starting place documenting location evidence
Once item photographed crime scene investigator take measurement evidence document location
There several method measuring evidence crime scene one common method rectangular coordinate method
To use method investigator pick fixed point scene reference point northwest corner master bedroom measure distance evidence point
Let use blood example
This simple sketch show u blood found floor eight foot nine inch east fixed point nine foot two inch south fixed point After blood stain documented place photograph note sketch ready collect
In example need collect blood using sterile swab
Because touching swab evidence blood need sterile sure contaminating evidence anything might swab
You also need wear glove contaminate swab DNA
Wearing glove cardinal rule almost crime scene investigation
If investigation requires additional like shoe cover hair net mask goggles body suit may required
Get FREE access day create account
Now documented collected evidence next step chain custody
You need sure evidence collected make crime scene evidence storage facility without tampered lost
Many crime scene unit transport evidence crime lab analysis collected scene
To ensure evidence tampered crime scene specialist create evidentiary seal evidence seal packaging used collection
The blood swab homicide investigation placed sterile envelope sealed evidence seal
Evidence tape jagged little edge make almost impossible peel without breaking
But type tape necessary creating evidence seal
An evidence seal created regular packaging tape collector initial badge employee identification number added tape
This seal allows collector recognize unbroken seal
So package swab collected handed trial several year able say evidence seal created intact
You testify confidence evidence tampered altered evidence sealed envelope date added
Evidence need follow process documenting collecting protecting evidence
It documented found scene
Documentation step include photography note taking sketching
It also collected manner protects contamination
It must marked packaged evidence seal ensure tampered compromised entered evidence storage facility crime lab
Following step ensures chain custody broken allows investigator testify confidence asked integrity evidence trial

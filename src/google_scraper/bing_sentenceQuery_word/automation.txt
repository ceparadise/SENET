The term inspired earlier word coming widely used Ford established automation department
It time industry rapidly adopting introduced
Fundamentally two type control loop open loop control closed loop feedback control
In open loop control control action controller independent process output controlled process variable
A good example central heating boiler controlled timer heat applied constant time regardless temperature building
The control action switching boiler
The process output building temperature
In closed loop control control action controller dependent process output
In case boiler analogy would include thermostat monitor building temperature thereby feed back signal ensure controller maintains building temperature set thermostat
A closed loop controller therefore feedback loop ensures controller exerts control action give process output Reference input set point
For reason closed loop controller also called feedback controller
The definition closed loop control system according British Standard Institution control system possessing monitoring feedback deviation signal formed result feedback used control action final control element way tend reduce deviation zero
Likewise system tends maintain prescribed relationship one system variable another comparing function variable using difference mean control
The advanced type automation revolutionized manufacturing aircraft communication industry feedback control usually involves taking measurement using making calculated adjustment keep measured variable within set range
The theoretical basis closed loop automation
The control action form controller output action
One simplest type control control
An example thermostat used household appliance either open close electrical contact
Thermostats originally developed true mechanism rather common household appliance thermostat
Sequence control programmed sequence operation performed often based system logic involves system state
An elevator control system example sequence control
A widely used
A PID controller continuously calculates difference desired measured applies correction based term respectively sometimes denoted give name controller type
The theoretical understanding application date implemented nearly analogue control system originally mechanical controller using discrete electronics latterly industrial process computer
Sequential control may either fixed sequence logical one perform different action depending various system state
An example adjustable otherwise fixed sequence timer lawn sprinkler
States refer various condition occur use sequence scenario system
An example elevator us logic based system state perform certain action response state operator input
For example operator press floor n button system respond depending whether elevator stopped moving going door open closed condition
An early development sequential control electrical relay engage electrical contact either start interrupt power device
Relays first used telegraph network developed controlling device starting stopping electric motor opening closing solenoid valve
Using relay control purpose allowed control action could triggered sequence response external event
These flexible response rigid cam timer
More complicated example involved maintaining safe sequence device swing bridge control lock bolt needed disengaged bridge could moved lock bolt could released safety gate already closed
The total number relay cam timer drum sequencer number hundred even thousand factory
Early technique language needed make system manageable one first diagram interconnected relay resembled rung ladder
Special computer called later designed replace collection hardware single easily unit
In typical hard wired motor start stop circuit called motor started pushing Start Run button activates pair electrical relay
The relay lock contact keep control circuit energized push button released
The start button normally open contact stop button normally closed contact

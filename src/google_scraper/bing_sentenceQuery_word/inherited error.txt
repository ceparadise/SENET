In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

As programming naturally encounter lot error
Causing understanding fixing error important part programming
Python best run anything tell run ca understand asking wo run program
All Python try tell little bit information went wrong order help try fix
Here two Python error
In first example forget use parenthesis required
Python understand trying
Here second example bug Python
In second example forget define variable
Python know want since defined error occurs
A happens Python ca understand saying
A happens Python understands saying run trouble following instruction
In English would like sentence The grammar sentence make sense
From perspective English grammar missing action
You understand asked
mean thing
In English would like sentence The sentence make sense grammatical perspective verb noun right place know asked
But encounter problem start trying eat piano except maybe termite
This called occurs program start running
We also talk end mean program run without crashing still produce wrong result
An example would This would logic error also open even though command make sense close back door actually accomplish goal keeping bug since still come front door
Here additional example syntax error occur Python

In serf element two principal operation The order element come stack give rise alternative name
Additionally operation may give access top without modifying stack
The name stack type structure come analogy set physical item stacked top make easy take item top stack getting item deeper stack may require taking multiple item first
Considered abstractly sequential collection push pop operation occur one end structure referred stack
This make possible implement stack pointer top element
A stack may implemented bounded capacity
If stack full contain enough space accept entity pushed stack considered state
The pop operation remove item top stack
Stacks entered computer science literature used term bury unbury mean calling returning subroutine
Subroutines already implemented proposed idea filed patent March Bauer received invention stack principle
The concept developed independently Australian first half
Stacks often described analogy stack plate cafeteria
Clean plate placed top stack pushing already
When plate removed stack one pop become new top
In many implementation stack operation push pop
An example top stack observes element without removing stack
Since done pop push data essential
An underflow condition occur stack top operation stack empty pop
Also implementation often function return whether stack empty
A stack easily implemented either
What identifies data structure stack either case implementation interface user allowed pop push item onto array linked list helper operation
The following demonstrate implementation using
An array used implement bounded stack follows
The first element usually bottom resulting first element pushed onto stack last element popped
The program must keep track size length stack using variable record number item pushed far therefore pointing place array next element inserted assuming index convention
Thus stack effectively implemented structure The operation add element increment index checking overflow Similarly decrement index checking underflow return item previously top one Using possible implement stack grow shrink much needed
The size stack simply size dynamic array efficient implementation stack since adding item removing item end dynamic array requires amortized O time
Another option implementing stack use
A stack pointer head list perhaps counter keep track size list Pushing popping item happens head list overflow possible implementation unless memory exhausted Some language make stack operation push pop available standard type
Some language notably family including designed around stack directly visible manipulated programmer
The following example manipulating stack Lisp interpreter prompt line starting interpreter response expression Several container type operation LIFO semantics additionally template class adapts existing container provide restricted operation
PHP class
Java library contains class specialization
Following example program language using class
A common use stack architecture level mean allocating accessing memory
A typical stack area computer memory fixed origin variable size
Initially size stack zero
A usually form hardware register point recently referenced location stack stack size zero stack pointer point origin stack
The two operation applicable stack There many variation basic principle stack operation
Every stack fixed location memory begin
As data item added stack stack pointer displaced indicate current extent stack expands away origin
Stack pointer may point origin stack limited range address either origin depending direction stack grows however stack pointer cross origin stack
In word origin stack address stack grows downwards towards address stack pointer must never incremented beyond etc
If pop operation stack cause stack pointer move past origin stack occurs
If push operation cause stack pointer increment decrement beyond maximum extent stack occurs
Some environment rely heavily stack may provide additional operation example Stacks often visualized growing bottom like stack
They may also visualized growing left right topmost becomes rightmost even growing top bottom
The important feature bottom stack fixed position
The illustration section example growth visualization top stack bottom since stack top item pushed popped
A move first element third position second first third second
Here two equivalent visualization process A stack usually represented computer block memory cell bottom fixed location stack pointer holding address current top cell stack
The top bottom terminology used irrespective whether stack actually grows towards lower memory address towards higher memory address
Pushing item stack adjusts stack pointer size item either decrementing incrementing depending direction stack grows memory pointing next cell copy new top item stack area
Depending exact implementation end push operation stack pointer may point next unused location stack may point topmost item stack
If stack point current topmost item stack pointer updated new item pushed onto stack point next available location stack updated new item pushed onto stack
Popping stack simply inverse pushing
The topmost item stack removed stack pointer updated opposite order used push operation
Many design including dedicated register use stack pointer dedicated call return push pop instruction implicitly update dedicated register thus increasing density
Some CISC processor like also typically stack pointer well
In contrast CPU design dedicated stack instruction therefore register may used stack pointer needed
The architecture example set register organised stack direct access individual register relative current top also possible
As machine general implicit argument allows small footprint good usage also prevents type optimization possible processor permitting two three operand
A stack structure also make implementation somewhat complex implement although still feasible exemplified modern implementation
example architecture using within another strategy avoid use slow main memory function argument return value
There also number small microprocessor implement stack directly hardware stack directly accessible
Examples line
Many microprocessor used implement programming language level
Stacks also used basis number mainframe mini computer
Such machine called famous
Calculators employing use stack structure hold value
Expressions represented prefix postfix infix notation conversion one form another may accomplished using stack
Many compiler use stack parsing syntax expression program block etc
translating low level code
Most programming language allowing parsed stack based machine
Another important application stack
Consider simple example finding correct path maze
There series point starting point destination
We start one point
To reach final destination several path
Suppose choose random path
After following certain path realise path chosen wrong
So need find way return beginning path
This done use stack
With help stack remember point reached
This done pushing point stack
In case end wrong path pop last point stack thus return last point continue quest find right path
This called backtracking
The prototypical example backtracking algorithm find vertex graph reached specified starting vertex
Other application backtracking involve searching space represent potential solution optimization problem
technique performing backtracking search without exhaustively searching potential solution space
A number meaning define basic operation adding two number printing character taking argument stack placing return value back stack
For example return stack operand stack also graphic state stack dictionary stack
Many also including
Almost way receive parameter return special stack hold information calling nesting order switch context called function restore caller function calling finish
The function follow runtime protocol caller callee save argument return value stack
Stacks important way supporting nested function call
This type stack used implicitly compiler support CALL RETURN statement equivalent manipulated directly programmer
Some programming language use stack store data local procedure
Space local data item allocated stack procedure entered deallocated procedure exit
The typically implemented way
Using stack data procedure call important security implication see programmer must aware order avoid introducing serious security bug program
Several use stack separate usual function call stack programming language principle organize information
These include Some computing environment use stack way may make vulnerable security breach attack
Programmers working environment must take special care avoid pitfall implementation
For example programming language use common stack store data local called procedure linking information allows procedure return caller
This mean program move data stack contains critical return address procedure call
If data moved wrong location stack oversized data item moved stack location large enough contain return information procedure call may corrupted causing program fail
Malicious party may attempt attack take advantage type implementation providing oversized data input program check length input
Such program may copy data entirety location stack may change return address procedure called
An attacker experiment find specific type data provided program return address current procedure reset point area within stack within data provided attacker turn contains instruction carry unauthorized operation
This type attack variation attack extremely frequent source security breach software mainly popular compiler use shared stack data procedure call verify length data item
Frequently programmer write code verify size data item either oversized undersized data item copied stack security breach may occur

Chapter Experimental Errors Error Analysis This chapter largely tutorial handling experimental error measurement
Much material extensively tested science undergraduate variety level University Toronto
Whole book written topic distill topic essential
Nonetheless experience beginner iterative approach material work best
This mean user first scan material chapter try use material experiment go material provides function ease calculation required propagation error function introduced Section
These error propagation function summarized Section
Introduction The Purpose Error Analysis For student attend lecture read textbook science easy get incorrect impression physical science concerned manipulating precise perfect number
Lectures textbook often contain phrase like For experimental scientist specification incomplete
Does mean acceleration closer
Does mean acceleration closer
Often answer depends context
If carpenter say length inch probably mean length closer


If machinist say length millimeter probably mean closer mm mm mm
We know acceleration due gravity varies place place earth surface
It also varies height surface gravity meter capable measuring variation floor tabletop readily available
Further physical measure determined mean experiment since perfect experimental apparatus exist impossible even principle ever know perfectly
Thus specification given useful possible exercise student
In order give meaning must changed something like Two question arise measurement
First accurate word experiment work properly necessary factor taken account
The answer depends skill experimenter identifying eliminating systematic error
These discussed Section
The second question regard precision experiment
In case precision result given experimenter claim precision result within
The next two section go detail precision measurement determined
However following point important
The person measurement probably gut feeling precision hung error result primarily communicate feeling people
Common sense always take precedence mathematical manipulation

In complicated experiment error analysis identify dominant error hence provide guide effort needed improve experiment

There virtually case experimental physical science correct error analysis compare result number book
A correct experiment one performed correctly one give result agreement measurement

The best precision possible given experiment always limited apparatus
Polarization measurement physic require ten thousand cost hundred thousand dollar perform good measurement within factor two
Electrodynamics experiment considerably cheaper often give result significant figure
In case experimenter must struggle equipment get precise accurate measurement possible
Different Types Errors As mentioned two type error associated experimental result precision accuracy
One text explains difference way Pugh
Winslow
The object good experiment minimize error precision error accuracy
Usually given experiment one type error dominant experimenter devotes effort toward reducing one
For example measuring height sample geranium determine average value random variation within sample plant probably going much larger possible inaccuracy ruler used
Similarly many experiment biological life science experimenter worry increasing precision measurement
Of course experiment biological life science dominated error accuracy
On hand titrating sample HCl acid NaOH base using phenolphthalein indicator major error determination original concentration acid likely one following accuracy marking side burette transition range phenolphthalein indicator skill experimenter splitting last drop NaOH
Thus accuracy determination likely much worse precision
This often case experiment chemistry certainly
Question Most experiment use theoretical formula usually formula approximation
Is error approximation one precision accuracy

Determining Precision The Standard Deviation In nineteenth century Gauss assistant astronomical measurement
However never able exactly repeat result
Finally Gauss got angry stormed lab claiming would show people measurement
The problem Gauss able repeat measurement exactly either
After recovered composure Gauss made histogram result particular measurement discovered famous Gaussian curve
Many people first introduction shape grade distribution course
Here sample distribution using function
We use standard package generate Probability Distribution Function Gaussian normal distribution
The mean chosen standard deviation chosen mean standard deviation defined
We normalize distribution maximum value close maximum number histogram plot result
In graph mean standard deviation
Finally look histogram plot together
We see functional form Gaussian distribution giving symbolic value
In formula quantity called called
The sometimes called
The definition follows
Here total number measurement result measurement number
The standard deviation measure width peak meaning larger value give wider peak
If look area curve area vertical bar graph find area percent total area
Thus result chosen random change within one standard deviation mean
We show evaluating integral
For convenience choose mean zero
Now numericalize multiply find percent
The problem measurement must repeated infinite number time standard deviation determined
If le infinity one estimate
For measurement best estimate
The major difference estimate definition denominator instead
This reasonable since know ca determine since one measurement way determining closely repeated measurement might give result
Technically quantity number degree freedom sample measurement
Here example
Suppose determine diameter small cylinder using micrometer
We repeat measurement time along various point cylinder get following result centimeter
The number measurement length list
The average mean calculated
Then standard deviation
We repeat calculation functional style
Note package standard includes function calculate quantity great deal
We close two point
The standard deviation associated error individual measurement
Section discus find error estimate average

This calculation standard deviation estimate
In fact find expected error estimate error estimate
As discussed detail Section mean true standard deviation probably lie range value
Viewed way clear last digit number meaning thus really significant
An function adjusts significant figure based error
discussed Section
The Reading Error There another type error associated directly measured quantity called reading error
Referring example Section measurement diameter performed micrometer
The particular micrometer used scale division every cm
However possible estimate reading micrometer division done example
But reading error associated estimation
For example first data point cm
Could cm instead
How cm
There fixed rule answer question person measurement must guess well read instrument
A reasonable guess reading error micrometer might cm good day
If experimenter late night reading error might cm
An important sometimes difficult question whether reading error instrument distributed randomly
Random reading error caused finite precision experiment
If experimenter consistently read micrometer cm lower actual value reading error random
For digital instrument reading error last digit
Note assumes instrument properly engineered round reading correctly display
THE Error So far found two different error associated directly measured quantity standard deviation reading error
So one actual real error precision quantity
The answer
However fortunately almost always turn one larger smaller two ignored
In diameter example used section estimate standard deviation found cm reading error cm
Thus use standard deviation estimate characterize error measurement
Another way saying thing observed spread value example accounted reading error
If observed spread le accounted reading error would necessary estimate standard deviation since reading error would error measurement
Of course everything section related precision experiment
Discussion accuracy experiment Section
Rejection Measurements Often repeating measurement one value appears spurious would like throw
Also taking series measurement sometimes one value appears line
Here discus guideline rejection measurement information appears Chapter
It important emphasize whole topic rejection measurement awkward
Some scientist feel rejection data justified unless evidence data question incorrect
Other scientist attempt deal topic using rule
Still others often incorrectly throw data appear incorrect
In section principle guideline presented information may found many reference
First note incorrect expect every measurement overlap within error
For example error particular quantity characterized standard deviation expect measurement normally distributed population within one standard deviation mean
percent measurement within two standard deviation within three standard deviation never expect measurement overlap within error truly Gaussian distribution
Of course experiment assumption Gaussian distribution approximation
If error measurement taken reading error expect measurement overlap within error
In case meaning however vague depends experimenter assigned error
Thus always dangerous throw measurement
Maybe unlucky enough make valid measurement lie ten standard deviation population mean
A valid measurement tail underlying distribution thrown
It even dangerous throw suspect point indicative underlying physical process
Very little science would known today experimenter always threw measurement match preconceived expectation
In general two different type experimental data taken laboratory question rejecting measurement handled slightly different way
The two type data following
A series measurement taken one variable changed data point
An example calibration thermocouple output voltage measured thermocouple number different temperature

Repeated measurement physical quantity variable held constant experimentally possible
An example measurement height sample geranium grown identical condition batch seed stock
For series measurement case one data point line natural tendency throw
But already mentioned mean assuming result attempting measure
As rule thumb unless physical explanation suspect value spurious three standard deviation away expected value probably kept
Chapter deal case
For repeated measurement case situation little different
Say measuring time pendulum undergo oscillation repeat measurement five time
Assume four trial within second fifth trial differs second three standard deviation away mean good value
There known reason one measurement differs others
Nonetheless may justified throwing
Say unknown measurement taken gravity wave swept region spacetime
However trying measure period pendulum gravity wave affecting measurement throwing one result reasonable
Although trying repeat measurement find existence gravity wave certainly fun
So whatever reason suspect value rule thumb may thrown provided fact well documented measurement repeated number time convince experimenter throwing important piece data indicating new physical process
Propagation Errors Precision Discussion Examples Usually error precision probabilistic
This mean experimenter saying actual value parameter within specified range
For example range equal one standard deviation probability repeated experimentation true mean fall within range range twice standard deviation probability etc
If two variable say want combine form new variable want error combination preserve probability
The correct procedure combine error quadrature square root sum square
supply function
For simple combination data random error correct procedure summarized three rule
stand error precision respectively
We assume independent
Note three rule assume error say small compared value
Rule Multiplication Division If z x In word fractional error quadrature fractional error
Rule Addition Subtraction If z x z x z Quadrature x In word error quadrature error
Rule Raising Power If equivalently includes function combine data using rule
They named
Imagine pressure data measured centimeter Hg volume data measured arbitrary unit
Each data point consists pair
We calculate pressure time volume
In value multiplied error ben combined using Rule
There equivalent form calculation
Consider first volume data
The error mean true value claimed experimenter probably lie
Thus significant figure presented right data point really significant
The function adjust volume data
Notice default us two significant digit error adjusting value
This controlled option
For case default two digit reasonable
As discussed Section assume normal distribution data fractional error determination standard deviation depends number data point used calculation written follows
Thus using general rule thumb error precision estimate error good one significant figure unless greater
Nonetheless keeping two significant figure handle case significance may attached final digit
You aware datum massaged extra digit dropped
By default function use function
The use controlled using option
The number digit adjusted
To form power say might tempted The reason wrong assuming error two quantity combined independent
Here one variable
The correct procedure given Rule previously discussed rewrite
This implemented function
Finally imagine reason wish form combination
We might tempted solve following
Again wrong two term subtraction independent
In fact general rule error Here example solving
We shall use avoid overwriting symbol
First calculate total derivative
Next form error
Now evaluate using pressure volume data get list error
Next form list pair
The function combine step default significant figure adjustment
The function used place function discussed
In example function somewhat faster
There caveat using
The expression must contain symbol numerical constant arithmetic operation
Otherwise function unable take derivative expression necessary calculate form error
The function limitation
Another Approach Error Propagation The Datum EDA value error Data Data The wrapper removed
The reason output previous two command formatted typesets pair using output
A similar construct used individual data point
Datum Datum Just typesetting us The construct provide automatic error propagation multiplication division addition subtraction raising power
Another advantage construct rule built know combine data constant
The rule also know propagate error many transcendental function
This rule assumes error small relative value approximate
The transcendental function accept argument given
We seen typesets construct using
The function used directly provided argument numeric error propagated
One may typeset input expression error propagated
The input mechanism combine term addition subtraction multiplication division raising power addition multiplication constant number use
The rule used numeric argument
This make different Why Quadrature
Here justify combining error quadrature
Although proof usual pristine mathematical sense correct made rigorous desired
First may already know Random Walk problem player start point move step either forward toward backward toward
The choice direction made randomly move say flipping coin
If step cover distance step expected probable distance player origin shown Thus distance go square root number step
Now consider situation measurement quantity performed identical random error
We find sum measurement
But sum error similar random walk although error magnitude equally likely essentially random
Thus expected probable error sum go square root number measurement
This exactly result obtained combining error quadrature
Another similar way thinking error abstract linear error space error span space
If error probabilistic uncorrelated error fact linearly independent orthogonal thus form basis space
Thus would expect add independent random error would use Pythagoras theorem combining quadrature
Finding Error Average The rule propagation error discussed Section allow one find error average mean number repeated measurement
Recall compute average first sum measurement found rule addition quantity allows computation error sum
Next sum divided number measurement rule division quantity allows calculation error result error mean
In case error measurement value result applying rule propagation error summarized theorem
Theorem If measurement random variable repeated time random variable standard deviation standard deviation mean
Proof One make measurement error
errx errx xn errx We calculate sum
sumx xn We calculate error sum
This last line key repeating measurement time error sum go
The mean given following
Applying rule division get following
This may rewritten
This completes proof
The quantity called usually called standard error sample mean standard deviation sample mean
The theorem show repeating measurement four time reduces error reduce error measurement must repeated time
Here example
In Section measurement diameter small cylinder discussed
The mean measurement cm standard deviation cm
Now calculate mean error adjusted significant figure
Note presenting result without significant figure adjustment make sense
The number implies meaning part centimeter
Here another example
Imagine weighing object dial balance turn dial pointer balance read mass marking dial
You find The g reading error balance good read particular piece equipment
You remove mass balance put back weigh get You get friend try get result
You get another friend weigh mass also get So four measurement mass body identical result
Do think theorem applies case
If yes would quote How went street started bringing stranger repeat measurement every one got So week identical measurement
Would error mass measured balance really following
The point rule statistic rough guide situation like example probably apply afraid ignore use uncommon sense
In example presenting result g probably reasonable thing
Calibration Accuracy Systematic Errors In Section made distinction error precision accuracy imagining performed timing measurement precise pendulum clock set length wrong leading inaccurate result
Here discus type error accuracy
To get insight wrong length arise may wish try comparing scale two ruler made different company discrepancy mm across cm common
If access ruler trust calibration standard use calibrate another ruler
One reasonable way use calibration instrument measure standard record multiply reading instrument
Since correction usually small practically never affect error precision also small
Calibration standard almost definition delicate expensive use direct measurement
Here example
We measuring voltage using analog Philips multimeter model
The result V measured V scale reading error decided V
Repeating measurement give identical result
It calculated experimenter effect voltmeter circuit measured le hence negligible
However manufacturer instrument claim accuracy full scale V corresponds Now claimed accuracy mean manufacturer instrument claim control tolerance component inside box point value read meter within time scale actual value
Furthermore random error given meter supposedly always read high low measurement repeated scale
Thus repeating measurement reduce error
A problem accuracy good manufacturer including Philips tend quite conservative give trustworthy specification manufacturer specification written sale department instead engineering department
And even Philips take account maybe last person use meter dropped
Nonetheless case probably reasonable accept manufacturer claimed accuracy take measured voltage If want need know voltage better two alternative use better expensive voltmeter take measurement calibrate existing meter
Using better voltmeter course give better result
Say used Fluke digital multimeter measured voltage However still position accept manufacturer claimed accuracy case reading digit To better must use even better voltmeter requires accepting accuracy even better instrument ad infinitum run time patience money
Say decide instead calibrate Philips meter using Fluke meter calibration standard
Such procedure usually justified large number measurement performed Philips meter
Why spend half hour calibrating Philips meter one measurement could use Fluke meter directly
We measure four voltage using Philips Fluke meter
For Philips instrument interested accuracy calibrating instrument
So use reading error Philips instrument error measurement accuracy Fluke instrument error measurement
We form list result measurement
We examine difference reading either dividing Fluke result Philips subtracting two value
The second set number closer value first set case adding correction Philips measurement perhaps appropriate multiplying correction
We form new data set format
We guess Philips measurement V appropriate correction factor V estimated error guess based partly fear meter inaccuracy may smooth four data point indicate
Thus corrected Philips reading calculated
You may wish know number example real data Philips meter read V Fluke meter measured voltage Finally subtlety Ohm law state resistance related voltage current across resistor according following equation
V IR Imagine trying determine unknown resistance using law using Philips meter measure voltage
Essentially resistance slope graph voltage versus current
If Philips meter systematically measuring voltage big say systematic error accuracy effect slope therefore effect determination resistance
So case measurement may quite justified ignoring inaccuracy voltmeter entirely using reading error determine uncertainty determination

In either following In programming language basic data type
In addition many language also provide set composite data type
Opinions vary whether type composite considered primitive
Depending language implementation primitive data type may may correspondence object computer memory
However one usually expects operation basic primitive data type fastest language construct
Integer addition example performed single machine instruction offer specific instruction process sequence character single instruction
In particular standard mention int object natural size suggested architecture execution environment
This mean likely bit long architecture
Basic primitive type almost always
Most language allow behavior capability primitive either basic data type modified program
Exceptions include permit data type extended within program adding operation performed even redefining operation
The actual range primitive data type available dependent upon specific programming language used
For example composite data type whereas modern dialect assimilated primitive data type basic
Classic basic primitive type may include More sophisticated type include An data type represents
Integers may either signed allowing negative value unsigned
Common range Literals integer written regular numeral consisting sequence digit negation indicated value
However programming language disallow use comma
Examples integer literal There several alternate method writing integer literal many programming language A type typically denoted bool boolean typically either true false
Although one bit necessary accommodate value set true false programming language typically implement boolean type one byte
Many language
implement booleans adhering concept distinct logical type
Languages though may implicitly convert booleans time give extended semantics booleans boolean expression achieve backwards compatibility earlier version language
For example former standard dedicated boolean type
Instead numeric value zero interpreted false value interpreted true
add distinct boolean type included support type true false reserved word
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally format equivalent typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
Many language often called float type
Literals floating point number include decimal point typically use denote scientific notation
Examples literal Some language also type comprising two number real part imaginary part
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally form typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
number also tend limited range value programmer must careful avoid overflow intermediate calculation well final result
A type typically called char may contain single specialized code
In defined smallest addressable unit memory
On system Several standard require size
Some language two character type example type character type character
The term character type normally used even type whose value precisely represent example code unit
Characters may combined
The string data include number numerical symbol treated text
Strings implemented various way depending programming language
The simplest way implement string create array character followed delimiting character used signal end string usually
These referred usually found language low amount
While easy implement null terminated string criticized causing
Most scripting language many dialect separate character type string length one normally used represent single character
Some language capability use string usually measure additionally provide class string handling respectively standard library
There also difference whether string mutable language
Mutable string may altered creation whereas immutable string maintain constant size content
In latter way alter string create new one
There advantage disadvantage approach although immutable string much le flexible simpler completely
Some example language use mutable string include whereas language include
A language provide different type mutable immutable string
Literals character string usually surrounded sometimes single quote used character double quote used string
Examples character literal C syntax Examples string literal C syntax Each numeric data type maximum minimum value known
Attempting store number outside range may lead error incorrect calculation due depending language used
The range variable based number byte used save value integer data type usually able store value number contribute value
For data type
value range complicated vary depending method used store
There also type use entire byte
boolean requires single represents value although practice byte often used remaining bit redundant
Some programming language also allow opposite direction programmer defines range precision needed solve given problem compiler chooses appropriate integer type automatically

I used word used basic data type boolean integer float etc
However William Stallings us context operating system algorithm referring callable function instruction example say pair primitive minimum set operation needed process engage message passing edition
Am I rightly understanding mean basic building block referring data type operation taken granted construction algorithm
Is widespread usage something peculiar Stallings
What best way define given usage
For mean something decomposed people use also word sometimes sense often also used explanation concurrency parallelism different meaning
For instance Unix Linux seen application primitive atomic either happen sometimes got interrupted give error
And inside interpreter even formal specification language primitive operation define interpreter deal specially
Very often primitive operation Lisp dialect

Trick Question Is primitive data type

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
My understanding primitive datatype It datatype provided language implicitly Others user defined class So different language different set datatypes considered primitive particular language
Is right
And difference basic datatype datatype
Wikipedia say primitive datatype either two
It kind depends language
For example language like C number scalar type etc
These primitive sense decomposed simpler component
From basic type define new type pointer type array type struct type union type etc
Then language like Lisp everything either
Again definition atom primitive sense decomposed something simpler
As far I concerned term primitive basic pretty much interchangeable
If want get pedantic though distinguish type explicitly provided language definition type derived type still primitive basic decomposed simpler element
C facility allows create new type name existing type
Ada allows create new scalar type constraint
For example derive Latitude type floating type constraint ca take value outside range
It still primitive basic type broken simpler component since considered type
Again concept little fuzzy really depends context
For example notion type meaningless typeless language like BLISS
From perspective In Java clear distinction primitive type
A variable primitive type directly contains value type word
A variable type contain value directly instead similar pointer object
It possible Java create value type
Java eight primitive type
Anything else type
A primitive basic data type built data type
It represent one single value
All primitive data type necessity compiler know data type primitive
In language compiler knowledge certain type built thing able treat special way
Examples would Variant Delphi Visual Basic Boo equivalent Duck base object class OO language
Why string type considered primitive type Java
Because Java Language Specification clearly specifies word primitive mean context Java Java conform specification whereas Language Specification defines primitive mean context string conforms specification
There really nothing
The specification respective language defines certain word mean something either fit description
For example C Language Specification defines meaning word function something clearly word function usually mean way word used inside C community
A data type mean value stored memory value method internal structure
A primitive operated external operation
In Java primitive number int long etc
char
If value structure I thinking strut primitive
If method object class primitive
I came across information felt would aid answer
So want share Wikipedia say I would like say way A basic datatype datatype broken string type made char char datatype In Programming language
So basic datatype Primitives fundamental data type provided language
Example C language int float char data type
It provided fundamental part language
Non primitive user defined variable object
For example define object store data use struct C define variable
These primitive define first order used
Examples Employee Student I think primitive variable came originally language variable like String declare using New keyword
That make object String would primitive
Answer comment It probably implementation variable
If part language core primitive
If
Example String
This core variable declared using New keyword
So primitive
For better understanding concept primitive type datatypes answer lack concept
If understand concept getting selected come know primitive datatypes compiler know
Thank interest question

When hear word primitive hopefully think something long ago basic simple
For example primitive shelter would one made material get job done provide protection element hotel
In Java primitive element data
They serve single purpose comprising wholesome simple value eight essential version
Let explore categorical format particular order
Before begin important note use primitive data broken two main category
Past see group finally type data
Like flipping coin turning switch asking basic question type data two possible value true false
In term standard false primary value size bit
Boolean tiniest Java data type given size
It also category primitive data neither subcategories group
primitive data contains remaining version broken even category
Our second type data type known
Such item reflects character Unicode
As matter reference refers standard depiction data
This would include letter C K L etc
special character cent sign foreign currency icon symbol
More character language represented Unicode
Char value bit size set
The char data type character version part numeric primitive data
It also one often used type
The third type primitive data known
With default value size byte
Float represents real number also utilize significant digit
Another way think number space decimal point
Hopefully sentence bring back bad memory grade school arithmetic
Think money expression
It listed numerical value side decimal point meaning three dollar cent

fourth version primitive data related float group
It twice size float byte contains default value
Notice similarity default value difference letter end
A key difference float double never use double expressing money value exact
fifth type Java primitive data set size bit byte used two complement integer
It one remaining four integer type
Bytes represent numeric range default value represent number set
They great keeping storage small data
Continuing integer group type primitive data
Comprising byte bit integer value default value long range
As byte short data positive alternative data type need larger range
The sixth primitive data type twice size short four time size byte byte bit
Of data type group category integer commonly used Java programming
It also contains default value
The final type data
The pattern size continues twice size integer bit byte
Still default value longest range data type probably utilize data billion
With eight version Java important programming language due purpose providing easy simple value use code
Each applies different situation based parameter require
From Boolean char double integer fundamental nature Java make utmost necessity

study use numerical opposed general problem distinguished
One earliest mathematical writing Babylonian tablet give numerical approximation length
Being able compute side triangle hence able compute extremely important instance construction
Numerical analysis continues long tradition practical mathematical calculation
Much like approximation square root modern numerical analysis seek exact answer exact answer often impossible obtain practice
Instead much numerical analysis concerned obtaining approximate solution maintaining reasonable bound error
Numerical analysis naturally find application field engineering physical science century also life science even art adopted element scientific computation
appear planet star galaxy important data analysis essential simulating living cell medicine biology
Before advent modern computer often depended hand large printed table
Since mid century computer calculate required function instead
These interpolation formula nevertheless continue used part software algorithm solving
The overall goal field numerical analysis design analysis technique give approximate accurate solution hard problem variety suggested following The rest section outline several important theme numerical analysis
The field numerical analysis predates invention modern computer many century
already use year ago
Many great mathematician past preoccupied numerical analysis obvious name important algorithm like
To facilitate computation hand large book produced formula table data interpolation point function coefficient
Using table often calculated decimal place function one could look value plug formula given achieve good numerical estimate function
The canonical work field publication edited page book large number commonly used formula function value many point
The function value longer useful computer available large listing formula still handy
The also developed tool hand computation
These calculator evolved electronic computer found computer also useful administrative purpose
But invention computer also influenced field numerical analysis since longer complicated calculation could done
Consider problem solving unknown quantity
For iterative method apply
The initial value
We conclude table solution
The algorithm might return number range error le
In race measured speed car three instant recorded following table
A would say speed car constant finally
For instance total distance traveled first minute approximately
This would allow u estimate total distance traveled example see using displacement velocity
Take function
Note change le turn change nearly
Evaluating near problem
By contrast evaluating function near problem
For instance modest change lead modest change
Direct method compute solution problem finite number step
These method would give precise answer performed
Examples include method solving
In practice used result approximation true solution assuming
In contrast direct method expected terminate finite number step
Starting initial guess iterative method form successive approximation exact solution limit
A convergence test often involving specified order decide sufficiently accurate solution hopefully found
Even using infinite precision arithmetic method would reach solution within finite number step general
Examples include
In computational matrix algebra iterative method generally needed large problem
Iterative method common direct method numerical analysis
Some method direct principle usually used though

For method number step needed obtain exact solution large approximation accepted manner iterative method
Furthermore continuous problem must sometimes replaced discrete problem whose solution known approximate continuous problem process called
For example solution
This function must represented finite amount data instance value finite number point domain even though domain
The study error form important part numerical analysis
There several way error introduced solution problem
arise impossible represent exactly machine finite memory practical
error committed iterative method terminated mathematical procedure approximated approximate solution differs exact solution
Similarly discretization induces solution discrete problem coincide solution continuous problem
For instance iteration sidebar compute solution iteration conclude root roughly example
We therefore truncation error
Once error generated generally propagate calculation
For instance already noted operation calculator computer inexact
It follows calculation type even inexact
What mean say truncation error created approximate mathematical procedure
We know integrate function exactly requires one find sum infinite trapezoid
But numerically one find sum finite trapezoid hence approximation mathematical procedure
Similarly differentiate function differential element approach zero numerically choose finite value differential element
important notion numerical analysis
An algorithm called error whatever cause grow much larger calculation
This happens problem meaning solution change small amount problem data changed small amount
To contrary problem small error data grow large error
Both original problem algorithm used solve problem combination possible
So algorithm solves problem may either numerically stable numerically unstable
An art numerical analysis find stable algorithm solving mathematical problem
For instance computing square root roughly problem
Many algorithm solve problem starting initial approximation instance computing improved guess etc
One method famous given
Another method call Method X given
We calculated iteration scheme table form initial guess
Observe Babylonian method converges quickly regardless initial guess whereas Method X converges extremely slowly initial guess diverges initial guess
Hence Babylonian method numerically stable Method X numerically unstable
The field numerical analysis includes many
Some major one We observed temperature vary degree Celsius degree
A linear interpolation data would conclude degree degree
If country growing average per year billion dollar last year might extrapolate billion dollar year
In linear regression given point compute line pass close possible point
Say sell lemonade notice sell glass lemonade per day increase sell one glass lemonade le per day
If could charge would maximize profit due constraint charge whole cent amount charging per glass yield maximum income per day
If set fan blow air one end room drop feather wind happens
The feather follow air current may complex
One approximation measure speed air blowing near feather every second advance simulated feather moving straight line speed one second measuring wind speed
This called solving ordinary differential equation
One simplest problem evaluation function given point
The straightforward approach plugging number formula sometimes efficient
For polynomial better approach using since reduces necessary number multiplication addition
Generally important estimate control arising use arithmetic
solves following problem given value unknown function number point value function point given point
similar interpolation except want find value unknown function point outside given point
also similar take account data imprecise
Given point measurement value function point error want determine unknown function
The one popular way achieve
Another fundamental problem computing solution given equation
Two case commonly distinguished depending whether equation linear
For instance equation linear
Much effort put development method solving
Standard direct method method use matrix
usually preferred large system
General iterative method developed using
used solve nonlinear equation named since root function argument function yield zero
If function derivative known popular choice
another technique solving nonlinear equation
Several important problem phrased term
For instance algorithm based singular value decomposition
The corresponding tool statistic called
Optimization problem ask point given function maximized minimized
Often point also satisfy
The field optimization split several subfields depending form objective function constraint
For instance deal case objective function constraint linear
A famous method linear programming
The method used reduce optimization problem constraint unconstrained optimization problem
Numerical integration instance also known numerical asks value definite
Popular method use one like midpoint rule
These method rely divide conquer strategy whereby integral relatively large set broken integral smaller set
In higher dimension method become prohibitively expensive term computational effort one may use see modestly large dimension method
Numerical analysis also concerned computing approximate way solution ordinary differential equation

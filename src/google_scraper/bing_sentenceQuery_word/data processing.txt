The term Data Processing DP also used previously refer department within organization responsible operation data processing application
Data processing may involve various process including The illustrates evolution data processing manual electronic procedure
Although widespread use term date data processing function performed manually millennium
For example involves function posting transaction producing report like
Completely manual method augmented application electronic
A person whose job perform calculation manually using calculator called
The schedule first gather data individual rather
A number question could answered making check appropriate box form
From Census Bureau employed system tallying reason increasing number combination classification required became increasingly complex
Only limited number combination could recorded one tally necessary handle schedule time many independent tally
It took year publish result census using manual processing method
The term applied operation performed mean application equipment
Using Hollerith punchcard equipment Census Office able complete tabulating census data year compared year census
It also estimated using Herman Hollerith system saved million processing cost dollar even twice many question
Computerized data processing represents later development computer used instead several independent piece equipment
The Census Bureau first made limited use using system delivered
The term mostly subsumed newer somewhat general term IT
The term data processing presently considered sometimes negative connotation suggesting use older technology
As example DPMA changed name
Nevertheless term approximately synonymous
Commercial data processing involves large volume input data relatively computational operation large volume output
For example insurance company need keep record ten hundred thousand policy print mail bill receive post payment
For science engineering term considered broad specialized term typically used
Data analysis us specialized precise statistical calculation le often observed typical general business environment
For data analysis software like free counterpart often used

Data processor play important role office setting
Academic program available community vocational college
Continue reading learn field need enter
Data processor often job title like data entry keyer typist word processor require many skill
These professional responsible recording data computer operating office equipment
As data processor might also called upon carry clerical duty
Data entry clerk data processor often find work hospital business law firm hotel insurance company organization detailed organization information necessary
You need computer skill basic understanding business operation
You use word processing software database system spreadsheet program work data processing
Similar job include claim support specialist underwriting support specialist
Several profession provide word processing service administrative assistant receptionist secretary clerk typist
These professional often perform administrative clerical duty data processor
The Bureau Labor Statistics BLS predicted job general office clerk including data processor would increase six percent
Employment opportunity expected increase people regularly improve skill compete advancing technology
As May data entry keyers earned average salary noted BLS
It also reported word processor typist made average salary period
Data processing always require formal education
The field open high school graduate often includes training
To enter field need good spelling skill solid understanding grammar
Some vocational technical community state college offer data processing program information processing certificate program last year
You might also able find online course data entry online course data processing

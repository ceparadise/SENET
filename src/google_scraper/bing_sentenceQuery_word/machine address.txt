In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

A machine virtual address physical address
Pages
How many entry needed conventional page table
The answer entry Why entry
My doubt number page table entry depend virtual address space rather physical address space
What mean virtual address space physical address space
The process access many page present physical memory
So make sense virtual physical memory address space
But virtual address space
Does mean different virtual address entry mapped physical location page table
Guess would lead inconsistency right
Can someone help get bigger picture
I really need internalize concept
When using Virtual Memory translating Virtual Address Space Physical Address Space
To understand requires entry consider page size
In order byte address KB require entry
If consider Virtual Address given u bit give u bit
These bit used indexing page table determining address page main memory
The reason virtual memory program getting large could fit main memory
So order allow greater degree multiprogramming virtual memory introduced
A program could memory
However required part would loaded memory required concept refered Demand Paging
Page table organized per number page frame

But using inverted page table reverse mapping done table organized per number frame


The main objective increase degree multi programming ability interact multiple process though insufficient amount physical memory

If I address machine machine likely follow RISC CISC design
address
address
address
To solve problem I first looked different term
When first investigating relationship RISC v CISC machine help I able quickly associate address CISC address RISC
I saw address instruction much complicated address therefore would make sense CISC design
Similar reasoning address machine RISC design
How would make distinguish CISC RISC address size middle
The problem term marketing term science engineering term
The term supposedly acronym Reduced Instruction Set Computing Complex Instruction Set Computing
Your assumption address much complicated address logic typically instruction associated RISC instruction associated CISC instruction common associated either RISC CISC
The term generally associated instruction set following characteristic Fixed width instruction
Usually
This make easier instruction decoder find boundary instruction
In CISC machine contrast different instruction range length much
This make job instruction decoder somewhat harder CISC machine result program consuming le memory
Fewer operand addressing mode
In RISC machine typically one available picture
Typically type instruction available addressing mode
The source operand found register result computation placed register
type instruction typically one operand register direct operand
type instruction typically
There typically also type instruction register indirect target sometimes instruction target operand
compared CISC instruction set
The reasoning trying keep instruction decoder simple possible RISC machine
The simple operand addressing mode easier implement simple pipeline decoder modern CISC machine often extra work instruction complex operand mode sequence like RISC instruction
There tendency RISC architecture register name available
Many RISC architecture register many CISC architecture
This making somewhat simpler exploit parallelism simple pipeline
Having available register name make possible compiler use different register name unrelated computation without requiring hardware register renaming
RISC architecture tend instruction CISC architecture tend mostly instruction
The notion also somewhat fuzzy somewhat
Every instruction operand source operand destination operand
The real distinction whether operand
In instruction make operand explicit
In instruction make destination operand explicit one source operand explicit
The third source operand always address destination operand
In instruction one source operand explicit
The source operand implicitly either accumulator register top stack destination operand
Finally instruction operand implicit usually two source operand top two value stack destination go back top stack
To sum marketing term really mean much
The important concept relationship different design choice choice make easier harder implement hardware pipeline
To understand technical aspect survive WanderingLogic said marketting aspect dominated quite quickly dichotomy need consider four point really dichotomy continuum history important RISC came reaction tentative close called
Do look simple arithmetic done give information look instruction like polynomial evaluation function entry automatic display setting register saving
Those complex instruction absent RISC present CISC
They introduced complication processor function could often implemented rapidly sequence simpler instruction especially needed full generality
RISC somewhat result ISA design trying make cost inclusion instruction justified benefit frequency execution
history important RISC became popular time implementing RISC single chip possible implementing CISC either use several chip space saving technique impact performance
You nearly define RISC answer question get high performance CPU area
When space available chip increased RISC cpu became CISCy
Now get high performance CPU small area
You ca rely cache chip lot register benefit locality data access
Thus accumulator stack architecture
Aspect carried register windowing
Pipelining
That mean overlappable instruction thus operand trouble independent instruction
Simplify decoding
Fixed width instruction
Thus wide enough operand cost implementing operand mostly instruction width get RISC operand ISA
Delayed jump le result pipelining decoding simplified extreme

set executed directly CPU
Each instruction performs specific task load operation unit data memory
Every program directly executed CPU made series instruction
The phrase executed need qualification machine code definition lowest level programming detail visible programmer internally many processor use optimise transform machine code instruction sequence sophisticated way
Numerical machine code may regarded representation primitive
While possible write program directly numerical machine code tedious error prone manage individual bit calculate numerical address constant manually
For reason program almost never written directly machine code modern context
Three exception low level program would called absence assembly machine language available
All practical program today written assembly language
The source code translated executable machine code utility important exception program translated machine code
However may seen executor processor performing instruction source code typically consists directly executable machine code generated assembly source code
Every processor processor family machine code
Instructions pattern physical design correspond different command machine
Thus instruction set specific class processor using mostly architecture
Successor derivative processor design often include instruction predecessor may add additional instruction
Occasionally successor design discontinue alter meaning instruction code typically needed new purpose affecting code compatibility extent even nearly completely compatible processor may show slightly different behavior instruction rarely problem
Systems may also differ detail memory arrangement operating system
Because program normally relies factor different system typically run machine code even type processor used
A machine code instruction set may instruction length may instruction
How pattern organized varies strongly particular architecture often also type instruction
Most instruction one field specifies basic instruction type arithmetic logical etc
actual operation add compare field may give type addressing offset index actual value constant operand contained instruction called
Not machine individual instruction explicit operand
An combined left operand result implicit accumulator arithmetic instruction
Other architecture accumulator version common instruction accumulator regarded one general register longer instruction
A operand implicit stack
Special purpose instruction also often lack explicit operand CPUID architecture writes value four implicit destination register instance
This distinction explicit implicit operand important code generator especially register allocation live range tracking part
A good code optimizer track implicit well explicit operand may allow frequent register register assigned result constant expression freed replacing constant code enhancement
A computer program sequence instruction executed CPU
While simple processor execute instruction one another processor capable executing several instruction
may influenced special instruction transfer execution instruction numerically following one
taken execution continues another address execution continues next instruction depending condition
A much readable rendition machine language called us refer machine code instruction rather using instruction numeric value directly
For example processor machine code cause CPU decrement would represented assembly language
The provides specific example machine code whose instruction always bit long
The general type instruction given operation field highest bit
jump immediate instruction fully specified
register instruction include additional field determine exact operation
The field used type indicate register operand give shift amount field contain operand directly
For example adding register placing result register encoded Load value register taken memory cell cell location listed register Jumping address In machine code implemented even fundamental underlying layer called providing common machine language interface across line family different model computer widely different underlying
This done facilitate machine language program different model
An example use IBM family computer successor
With dataflow path width bit bit beyond nevertheless present common architecture machine language level across entire line
Using microcode implement enables computer present architecture entirely different computer
The line used allow porting program earlier IBM machine new family computer
emulator IBM model
Machine code generally different also known either executed interpreter compiled machine code faster direct execution
An exception processor designed use particular bytecode directly machine code case
Machine code assembly code sometimes called referring part language feature library
The computer architecture physically separate storage signal pathway code instruction
Today processor implement separate signal pathway performance reason actually implement support task like loading program data executing
Harvard architecture contrasted data code stored memory read processor allowing computer execute command
From point view part code execution stored

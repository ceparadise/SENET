A tree hierarchical data structure
Generally tree consists value together pointer tree
For example could see class definition like Here child array pointer also hold value
At point child array empty make tree child base case recursive definition tree
When draw pointer line look like tree hence name
Here root node A
The child list A pointer B C Then child list C contains H I example The child list leaf node empty called leaf node see tree top
As might imagine tree useful representing hierarchy object
They also useful maintaining set number collection number subdivided smaller range hierarchically
A tree abstract data type node consists one element number upper bound tree node one one parent except root parent
The consequence two may equal ie content equivalent ca exactly one path node therefore loop
Since I specify rather arc tree I imply unidirectional flow specify
Really come thing tree defined parent therefore far tree concerned nothing go reverse direction
There formal abstract data type notation define tree general specific tree
These give form set notation lambda calculus formal version
It useful use formal notation eliminate ambiguity provide mean testing implementation ensure terminology consistent work across language
A plain English description good enough though
A different approach start graph collection node node point arbitrary number node arc may circular restrict spanning tree graph one path given point arc unidirectional
It produce different abstract form form start readily generalized
Finding effect two distinct ADTs always easy

A way modelling domain level detail much domain model
Inside design class diagram class become object Objects created according Object Class Definition
An Object Class definition type template creating object
It includes declaration attribute operation associated object class
In UML object class represented section object attribute object operation
An example shown using object class model If one thing Object Oriented way top section would declaration variable bottom section
Now going get bog fast warning hehe
Now part need read An exam contains different type question Using draw Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain
First thing first need identify Classes
Well quite obviously Classes straight top BUT look see
Well saw inherit something right inherit Question think one contain something variable operation etc etc really want write declaration time
But Multiple Choice question
They contain multiple answer surely need type could use Multiple Choice Question Options That mean class
So quick guidance Domain Model look like Here
Aside
I realised missed something im sooo sorry So yeah extra feature inside Design Class Diagram besides bleeding These extra feature forgot mention I think either leave comment email uni come bother hahaha OK go

Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set

In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set
This kind diagram invented year paper work named On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings John Venn Philosophical Magazine Journal Science used teach elementary set theory well illustrate simple set relationship logic linguistics probability computer science
Venn never used term Venn diagram referred invention Eulerian Circles

also known extrapolation back time measured characteristic individual population
It important application reconstruction study relationship among individual population ancestor
In context ancestral reconstruction used recover different kind ancestral character state organism lived million year ago
These state include composition gene order measurable characteristic organism ancestral population specie ancestral range reconstruction
This desirable allows u examine part corresponding distant past clarifying evolutionary history specie tree
Since modern essentially variation ancient one access ancient sequence may identify variation organism could arisen sequence
In addition genetic sequence one might attempt track changing one character trait another fin turning leg
application include reconstruction vocabulary phoneme cultural characteristic ancient society oral tradition marriage practice
Ancestral reconstruction relies sufficiently realistic accurately recover ancestral state
These model use genetic information already obtained method determine route taken evolutionary event occurred
No matter well model approximates actual evolutionary history however one ability accurately reconstruct ancestor deteriorates increasing evolutionary time ancestor observed descendant
Additionally realistic model evolution inevitably complex difficult calculate
Progress field ancestral reconstruction relied heavily concomitant development efficient algorithm joint reconstruction ancestral sequence
Methods ancestral reconstruction often applied given already inferred data
While convenient approach disadvantage result contingent accuracy single phylogenetic tree
In contrast researcher advocate computationally intensive approach account uncertainty tree reconstruction evaluating ancestral reconstruction many tree
The concept ancestral reconstruction often credited
Motivated development technique determining protein Zuckerkandl Pauling postulated sequence could used infer relating observed protein sequence also ancestral protein sequence earliest point root tree
However idea reconstructing ancestor measurable biological characteristic already developing field one precursor modern phylogenetics
Cladistic method appeared early infer evolutionary relationship specie basis distribution shared characteristic inferred descended common ancestor
Furthermore articulated principle ancestral reconstruction phylogenetic context inferring evolutionary history
Thus ancestral reconstruction root several discipline
Today computational method ancestral reconstruction continue extended applied diversity setting ancestral state inferred biological characteristic molecular sequence also structure property ancient versus modern geographic location population specie structure genome
One prominent example tracing evolution took place ape man
Any attempt ancestral reconstruction begin
In general phylogeny order population referred related descent common ancestor
Observed taxon represented tree progressively connected branch common ancestor represented branching point tree usually referred
Eventually lineage converge entire sample taxon
In context ancestral reconstruction phylogeny often treated though known quantity Bayesian approach important exception
Because enormous number phylogeny nearly equally effective explaining data reducing subset phylogeny supported data single representative point estimate convenient sometimes necessary simplifying assumption
Ancestral reconstruction thought direct result applying hypothetical model evolution given phylogeny
When model contains one free parameter overall objective estimate parameter basis measured characteristic among observed taxon sequence descended common ancestor
important exception paradigm though shown circumstance maximum likelihood estimator core simply based heuristic change character state rare without attempting quantify rarity
There three different class method ancestral reconstruction
In chronological order discovery
Maximum parsimony considers evolutionary event equally likely maximum likelihood account differing likelihood certain class event Bayeisan inference relates conditional probability event likelihood tree well amount uncertainty associated tree
Maximum parsimony maximum likelihood yield single probable outcome whereas Bayesian inference account uncertainty data yield sample possible tree
Parsimony known colloquially refers principle selecting simplest competing hypothesis
In context ancestral reconstruction parsimony endeavour find distribution ancestral state within given tree minimizes total number character state change would necessary explain state observed tip tree
This method one earliest formalized algorithm reconstructing ancestral state well one simplest
Maximum parsimony implemented one several algorithm
One earliest example assigns ancestral character state parsimony via two traversal rooted
The first stage proceeds tip toward root tree visiting descendant child node parent
Initially determining set possible character state ancestor based observed character state descendant
Each assignment character state ancestor descendant intersection empty set
In latter case implied character state change occurred ancestor one two immediate descendant
Each event count towards algorithm cost function may used discriminate among alternative tree basis maximum parsimony
Next tree performed proceeding root towards tip
Character state assigned descendant based character state share parent
Since root parent node one may required select character state arbitrarily specifically one possible state reconstructed root
For example consider phylogeny recovered genus plant containing specie A F Figure plant pollinated either bee hummingbird wind
One obvious question pollinator deeper node phylogeny genus plant
Under maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction clade reveals hummingbird parsimonious ancestral state lower clade plant D E F ancestral state node top clade plant A B C equivocal hummingbird bee pollinator equally plausible pollination state root phylogeny
Supposing strong evidence fossil record root state hummingbird
Resolution root hummingbird would yield pattern ancestral state reconstruction depicted symbol node Figure state requiring fewest number change circled
Parsimony method intuitively appealing highly efficient still used case seed maximum likelihood optimization algorithm initial phylogeny
However underlying assumption evolution attained certain end result fast possible inaccurate
Natural selection evolution work towards goal simply select randomly occurring genetic change
Parsimony method impose six general assumption phylogenetic tree using correct relevant data mistake made coding branch phylogenetic tree equally likely change rate evolution slow chance losing gaining characteristic
In reality assumption often violated leading several issue ML method ancestral state reconstruction treat character state internal node tree parameter attempt find parameter value maximize probability data observed character state given hypothesis model evolution phylogeny relating observed sequence taxon
In word method assumes ancestral state statistically likely given observed phenotype
Some earliest ML approach ancestral reconstruction developed context similar model also developed analogous case discrete character evolution
The use model evolution account fact event equally likely happen
For example type point mutation one purine another one pyrimidine another much likely happen chance purine switched pyrimidine vice versa
These difference captured maximum parsimony
However event likely others mean always happen
We know throughout evolutionary history time large gap likely happen actually occurred
When case maximum parsimony may actually accurate willing make large unlikely leap maximum likelihood
Maximum likelihood shown quite reliable reconstructing character state good job giving accurate estimation stability protein
Maximum likelihood always overestimate stability protein make sense since assumes protein made used stable optimal
The merit maximum likelihood subject debate concluded maximum likelihood test represents good medium accuracy speed
However study complained maximum likelihood take much time computational power useful scenario
These approach employ probabilistic framework used infer phylogenetic tree
In brief evolution genetic sequence modelled continuous time
In simplest character undergo independent state transition nucleotide substitution constant rate time
This basic model frequently extended allow different rate branch tree
In reality mutation rate may also vary time due example environmental change modelled allowing rate parameter evolve along tree expense increased number parameter
A model defines transition probability state along branch length unit evolutionary time
The likelihood phylogeny computed nested sum transition probability corresponds hierarchical structure proposed tree
At node likelihood descendant summed possible ancestral character state node computing likelihood rooted node direct descendant denotes character state node branch length evolutionary time node set possible character state example nucleotide A C G T
Thus objective ancestral reconstruction find assignment internal node maximizes likelihood observed data given tree
Rather compute overall likelihood alternative tree problem ancestral reconstruction find combination character state ancestral node highest marginal maximum likelihood
Generally speaking two approach problem
First one assign likely character state ancestor independently reconstruction ancestral state
This approach referred
It akin summing combination ancestral state node tree including root node data available
Second one may instead attempt find joint combination ancestral character state throughout tree jointly maximizes likelihood data
Thus approach referred joint reconstruction
Not surprisingly joint reconstruction marginal reconstruction
Nevertheless efficient algorithm joint reconstruction developed time complexity generally linear number observed taxon sequence
method ancestral reconstruction tend provide greater accuracy MP method presence variation rate evolution among character across site genome
However method yet able accommodate variation rate evolution time otherwise known
If rate evolution specific character accelerates branch phylogeny amount evolution occurred branch underestimated given length branch assuming constant rate evolution character
In addition difficult distinguish heterotachy variation among character rate evolution
Since ML unlike maximum parsimony requires investigator specify model evolution accuracy may affected use grossly incorrect model model misspecification
Furthermore ML provide single reconstruction character state often referred point estimate likelihood surface highly comprising multiple peak local optimum single point estimate provide adequate representation Bayesian approach may suitable
us likelihood observed data update investigator belief yield
In context ancestral reconstruction objective infer posterior probability ancestral character state internal node given tree
Moreover one integrate probability posterior distribution parameter evolutionary model space possible tree
This expressed application represents ancestral state corresponds observed data represents evolutionary model phylogenetic tree
likelihood observed data computed given
prior probability ancestral state given model tree
Finally probability data given model tree integrated possible ancestral state
Bayesian inference method many argued accurate
In general Bayesian statistical method allow investigator combine information new hypothesis
In case evolution combine likelihood data observed likelihood event happened order recognizing potential error uncertainty
Overall accurate method reconstructing ancestral genetic sequence well protein stability
Unlike two method Bayesian inference yield distribution possible tree allowing accurate easily interpretable estimate variance possible outcome
We given two formulation emphasize two different application Bayes theorem discus following section
One first implementation Bayesian approach ancestral sequence reconstruction developed Yang colleague maximum likelihood estimate evolutionary model tree respectively used define prior distribution
Thus approach example compute posterior probability ancestral character state method first implemented software package PAML
In term Bayesian rule formulation empirical Bayes method fix empirical estimate model tree obtained data effectively dropping posterior likelihood prior term formula
Moreover Yang colleague used empirical distribution site pattern assignment nucleotide tip tree alignment observed nucleotide sequence denominator place exhaustively computing possible value given
Computationally empirical Bayes method akin maximum likelihood reconstruction ancestral state except rather searching ML assignment state based respective probability distribution internal node probability distribution reported directly
ancestral reconstruction require investigator assume evolutionary model parameter tree known without error
When size complexity data make unrealistic assumption may prudent adopt fully hierarchical Bayesian approach infer joint posterior distribution ancestral character state model tree
Huelsenbeck Bollback first proposed hierarchical Bayes method ancestral reconstruction using MCMC method sample ancestral sequence joint posterior distribution
A similar approach also used reconstruct evolution symbiosis algae fungal specie
For example MCMC explores joint posterior distribution accepting rejecting parameter assignment basis ratio posterior probability
Put simply empirical Bayes approach calculates probability various ancestral state specific tree model evolution
By expressing reconstruction ancestral state set probability one directly quantify uncertainty assigning particular state ancestor
On hand hierarchical Bayes approach average probability possible tree model evolution proportion likely tree model given data observed
Whether hierarchical Bayes method confers substantial advantage practice remains controversial however
Moreover fully Bayesian approach limited analyzing relatively small number sequence taxon space rapidly becomes vast making computationally infeasible converge reasonable amount time
Ancestral reconstruction informed observed state historical sample known age fossil archival specimen
Since accuracy ancestral reconstruction generally decay increasing time use specimen provides data closer ancestor reconstructed likely improve analysis especially rate character change vary time
This concept validated experimental evolutionary study replicate population propagated generate artificial phylogeny
In revisiting experimental data Oakley Cunningham found maximum parsimony method unable accurately reconstruct known ancestral state continuous character result verified computer simulation
This failure ancestral reconstruction attributed directional bias evolution plaque size large small plaque diameter required inclusion fossilized sample address
Studies mammalian carnivore fish demonstrated without incorporating fossil data reconstructed estimate ancestral body size unrealistically large
Moreover Graham Slater colleague showed using incorporating fossil data prior distribution improved Bayesian inference ancestral state evolutionary model selection relative analysis using contemporaneous data
Many model developed estimate ancestral state discrete continuous character extant descendant
Such model assume evolution trait time may modelled stochastic process
For trait pollinator type process typically taken trait process frequently taken
Using model basis statistical inference one use method estimate ancestral state
Suppose trait question may fall one state labelled
The typical mean modelling evolution trait via Markov chain may briefly described follows cf
Figure
Each state associated rate transition state
The trait modelled stepping state reach given state start exponential clock state step
It race clock take step towards state whose clock first ring
In model parameter transition rate estimated using example maximum likelihood method one maximizes set possible configuration state ancestral node
In order recover state given ancestral node phylogeny call node maximum likelihood procedure find maximum likelihood estimate compute likelihood possible state conditioning finally choose ancestral state maximizes
One may also use substitution model basis Bayesian inference procedure would consider posterior belief state ancestral node given prior
Because model may many parameter overfitting may issue
Some common choice reduce parameter space The binary state speciation extinction model BiSSE model directly follow framework mentioned
It allows estimation ancestral binary character state jointly associated different character state may also straightforwardly extended general model
In basic form model involves six parameter two speciation rate one lineage state similarly two extinction rate two rate character change
This model allows hypothesis testing rate change cost increasing number parameter
In case trait instead take value one must instead turn model trait evolves continuous process
Inference ancestral state maximum likelihood Bayesian method would proceed likelihood transition state adjacent node given continuous probability distribution
widely used infer ecological phenotypic biogeographic trait associated ancestral node phylogenetic tree
It noted method ancestral trait reconstruction pitfall use mathematical model predict trait changed large amount missing data
This missing data includes state extinct specie relative rate evolutionary change knowledge initial character state accuracy phylogenetic tree
In case ancestral trait reconstruction used finding justified examination biological data support model based conclusion

ancestral state reconstruction recovers broadly similar result one significant difference common ancestor tree finch ground finch clade likely granivorous rather insectivorous judged parsimony
In case difference ancestral state returned maximum parsimony maximum likelihood likely occurs result fact ML estimate consider branch length phylogenetic tree

Ancestor reconstruction based parsimony equivalent maximum likelihood character evolution indicates one three main subclades lineage undergone major evolutionary increase proportion glycolytic fiber iliofibularis muscle
In analysis body mass specie comparing stable model continuous character evolution model Elliot Mooers showed evolutionary process describing mammalian body mass evolution best characterized continuous character evolution accommodates rare change large magnitude
Under stable model ancestral mammal retained low body mass early diversification large increase body mass coincident origin several Orders large body massed specie
ungulate
By contrast simulation Brownian motion model recovered le realistic order magnitude larger body mass among ancestral mammal requiring significant reduction body size prior evolution Orders exhibiting small body size

Thus stable model recover realistic picture mammalian body mass evolution permitting large transformation occur small subset branch
inference drawn comparison related taxon often used identify biological characteristic evolve independently reveal underlying dependence
For example evolution shape finch beak may associated foraging behaviour
However advisable search association direct comparison measurement genetic sequence observation independent descent common ancestor
For discrete character problem first addressed framework maximum parsimony evaluating whether two character tended undergo change branch tree
identified problem continuous character evolution proposed solution similar ancestral reconstruction phylogenetic structure data accommodated statistically directing analysis computation independent contrast node tree related branch
On molecular level different location protein may evolve direct physicochemical interaction indirectly interaction common substrate interaction protein structure
Conversely folded structure protein could potentially inferred distribution residue interaction
One earliest application ancestral reconstruction predict residue contact published Shindyalov colleague
Phylogenies relating different protein family generated clustering method UPGMA ancestral sequence reconstructed parsimony
The author reported weak significant tendency pair residue known structure protein
The reconstruction ancient protein DNA sequence recently become significant scientific endeavour
The development extensive genomic sequence database conjunction advance biotechnology phylogenetic inference method made ancestral reconstruction cheap fast scientifically practical
This concept applied identify residue protein sequence using advanced method reconstruction phylogeny ancestral sequence
For example ancestral reconstruction used identify residue protein encoded RNA virus genome particularly HIV
Ancestral reconstruction allows recreation protein DNA evolution laboratory studied directly
With respect protein allows investigation evolution molecular structure function
Additionally ancestral protein reconstruction lead discovery new biochemical function lost modern protein
It also allows insight biology ecology extinct organism
Although majority ancestral reconstruction dealt protein also used test evolutionary mechanism level bacterial genome primate gene sequence
RNA virus HIV evolve extremely rapid rate order magnitude faster mammal bird
For organism ancestral reconstruction applied much shorter time scale example order reconstruct global regional progenitor spanned decade rather million year
A team around Brian Gaschen proposed reconstructed strain used target design effort opposed sequence isolated patient present day
Because HIV extremely diverse vaccine designed work one patient viral population might work different patient evolutionary distance two virus may large
However recent common ancestor closer two virus
Thus vaccine designed common ancestor could better chance effective larger proportion circulating strain
Another team took idea developing reconstruction method produce sequence whose total evolutionary distance contemporary strain small possible
Strictly speaking method reconstruction COT sequence necessarily represent sequence ever existed evolutionary history virus
However Rolland colleague find case HIV COT virus functional synthesized
Similar experiment synthetic ancestral sequence obtained maximum likelihood reconstruction likewise shown ancestor functional immunogenic lending credibility method
Furthermore ancestral reconstruction potentially used infer genetic sequence transmitted HIV variant gone establish next infection objective identifying distinguishing characteristic variant selection transmitted population virus may targeted vaccine design
Rather inferring ancestral DNA sequence one may interested molecular structure content ancestral genome
This problem often approached combinatorial framework modelling genome gene homologous region
Various operation allowed permutation segment permutation reversed segment removed segment removed one part permutation spliced somewhere else gain genetic content
The genome rearrangement problem first posed Watterson colleague asks given two genome permutation set allowable operation shortest sequence operation transform one genome
A generalization problem applicable ancestral reconstruction multiple genome rearrangement problem given set genome set allowable operation find binary tree given genome leaf ii assignment genome internal node tree total number operation across whole tree minimized
This approach similar parsimony except tree inferred along ancestral sequence
Unfortunately even single genome rearrangement problem although received much attention mathematics computer science review see Fertin colleague
The reconstruction ancestral genome also called reconstruction
Chromosome painting currently main experimental technique
Recently researcher developed computational method reconstruct ancestral karyotype taking advantage
Furthermore comparative genomics ancestral genome reconstruction applied identify ancient horizontal gene transfer event last common ancestor lineage
Accumulibacter phosphatis identify evolutionary basis trait acquisition
Ancestral reconstruction limited biological trait
Spatial location also trait ancestral reconstruction method infer location ancestor individual consideration
Such technique used Lemey colleague geographically trace ancestor strain sampled twenty locality Europe Asia sequence sampled across twelve African country
Treating location discrete state country city etc
allows application model described
However unlike model state space trait small may many location transition certain pair state may rarely never occur example migration distant locale may never happen directly air travel two place exist migration must pas intermediate locale first
This mean could many parameter model zero close zero
To end Lemey colleague used Bayesian procedure estimate parameter ancestral state also select migration parameter zero work suggests procedure lead efficient use data
They also explore use prior distribution incorporate geographical structure hypothesis migration dynamic finding considered little effect finding
Using analysis team around Lemey found likely hub diffusion also receiving posterior support
Further result support hypothesis presence African rabies
Inferring historical pattern often requires reconstructing ancestral range specie phylogenetic tree
For instance phylogeny plant specie genus used together information geographic range compare four method ancestral range reconstruction
The team compared Fitch parsimony FP parsimony stochastic mapping SM maximum likelihood analysis DIVA parsimony DEC
Results indicated parsimony method performed poorly likely due fact parsimony method consider branch length
Both method performed better however DEC analysis additionally allow incorporation geological prior gave realistic inference range evolution relative method
Another maximum likelihood method recovers phylogeographic history gene reconstructing ancestral location sampled taxon
This method assumes spatially explicit random walk model migration reconstruct ancestral location given geographic coordinate individual represented tip phylogenetic tree
When applied phylogenetic tree chorus frog method recovered recent northward expansion higher dispersal distance recently colonized region ancestral location directional migration
The first consideration multiple genome rearrangement problem long formalization term permutation presented Sturtevant Dobzhansky
They examined genome several strain different geographic location observed one configuration called standard common throughout studied area
Remarkably also noticed four different strain could obtained standard sequence single inversion two others could related second inversion
This allowed hypothesize phylogeny sequence infer standard sequence probably also ancestral one
Reconstructions word phenomes ancient performed based observed analogue language
Typically analysis carried manually using comparative method

Second correspondence individual sound cognate identified step similar biological although performed manually
Finally likely ancestral sound hypothesised manual inspection various heuristic fact language

The branch phylogeny rotated around node without changing evolutionary relationship
If want determine two taxon related important look node branch tree ordering descendant taxon
Sometimes evolutionary relationship taxon determined
This result phylogeny node two group split
A group includes ancestor descendant
Clades also called nested larger clade
For example monophyletic group descended common ancestor
Within mammal also many smaller clade primate bat
Not grouping organism qualify monophyletic
A group consists ancestor descendant
animal like crocodile lizard snake
This actually paraphyletic grouping ancestor gave rise reptile also gave rise bird
If bird added definition reptile could considered monophyletic group
A group made various descendant recent common ancestor

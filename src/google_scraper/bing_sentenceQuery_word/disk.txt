In occurs computer subsystem constant state rapidly exchanging data memory data disk exclusion processing
This cause performance computer degrade collapse
The situation may continue indefinitely underlying cause addressed
The term various similar phenomenon particularly movement level process progress slowly significant time spent acquiring resource
If access sufficient number memory page futile repetitive swapping condition known thrashing often arises rate typically becomes high
This frequently lead high runaway CPU utilization grind system halt
In modern computer thrashing may occur paging system sufficient disk access time overly long communication subsystem especially conflict internal bus access etc
Depending configuration algorithm involved system may degrade multiple
Thrashing state CPU performs work le
The overall memory access time may increase though higher level memory fast next lower level memory hierarchy
The CPU busy swapping page much respond user program interrupt much required
Thrashing occurs many page memory page refers another page
The real memory shortens capacity page us memory
When page execution demand page currently real memory RAM place page virtual memory adjusts required page RAM
If CPU busy task thrashing occurs
In system thrashing may caused program workload present insufficient program workload effectively held within physical memory constant data swapping thrashing may occur
The term first used tape operating system day describe sound tape made data rapidly written read
An example sort situation occurred series particular instruction could consist execute instruction cross page boundary point move instruction also cross page boundary targeting move data source cross page boundary target data also cross page boundary
The total number page thus used particular instruction eight eight page must present memory time
If operating system allocates fewer eight page actual memory attempt swap part instruction data bring remainder instruction page fault thrash every attempt restart failing instruction
Thrashing best known context memory storage analogous phenomenon occur including Where main memory accessed pattern lead multiple main memory location competing cache line resulting excessive
This problematic cache low
Where TLB acting cache MMU translates virtual address physical address small working set page
TLB thrashing occur even instruction cache data cache thrashing occurring cached different size
Instructions data cached small block entire page address lookup done page level
Thus even code data working set fit cache working set across many page virtual address working set may fit TLB causing TLB thrashing
Frequent due failure allocate memory object due insufficient free memory insufficient contiguous free memory due referred heap thrashing
A similar phenomenon occurs process interacting process scheduled run time experience process thrashing due repeatedly scheduled unscheduled progressing slowly

Originally term RAID defined usually refers
RAID storage us multiple disk order provide fault tolerance improve overall performance increase capacity system
This contrast older storage device used single disk drive store data
RAID allows store data multiple pace balanced way improve overall performance
RAID disk drive used frequently server generally necessary personal computer
With RAID technology data one disk array one disk fails data preserved
Thanks technique known technique spreading data multiple disk drive RAID also offer option reading writing one disk time order improve performance
In arrangement data broken segment sent various disk array speeding throughput
A typical RAID array us multiple disk appear single device provide storage capacity single disk
RAID device use many different architecture called level depending desired balance performance fault tolerance
RAID level describe data distributed across drive
Standard RAID level include following Provides data striping spreading block file across multiple disk drive redundancy
This improves performance deliver fault tolerance
If one drive fails data array lost
Provides disk mirroring
Level provides twice read transaction rate single disk write transaction rate single disk
Not typical implementation rarely used Level stripe data bit level rather block level
Provides striping dedicated parity disk
Level service simultaneous multiple request also rarely used
A commonly used implementation RAID Level provides striping like Level parity disk
If data disk fails parity data used create replacement disk
A disadvantage Level parity disk create write bottleneck
Provides data striping byte level also stripe error correction information
This result excellent performance good fault tolerance
Level one popular implementation RAID
Provides striping parity data distributed across disk
Not one original RAID level multiple RAID mirror created RAID stripe created
Some device use one level hybrid nested arrangement vendor also offer proprietary RAID level
Examples RAID level include following Not one original RAID level two RAID stripe created RAID mirror created
Used replicating sharing data among disk
A trademark Storage Computer Corporation add caching Levels
A RAID implementation two disk
Data striping combined mirroring written stripe one remaining disk array
Also called EMC Corporation proprietary striped parity RAID system used Symmetrix storage system
Before RAID device became popular system used single drive store data
This arrangement sometimes referred SLED single large expensive disk
However SLEDs drawback
First create data read disk quickly enough keep component system particularly processor
Second SLED fails data lost unless recently backed onto another disk tape
In three University California Berkeley researcher David Patterson Garth Gibson Randy Katz first defined term RAID paper titled
They theorized spreading data across multiple drive could improve system performance lower cost reduce power consumption avoiding potential reliability problem inherent using inexpensive le reliable disk
The paper also described five original RAID level
Today RAID technology nearly ubiquitous among enterprise storage device also found many consumer storage device
However storage option exist
One alternative Just Bunch Drives
JBOD architecture utilizes multiple disk disk device addressed separately
JBOD provides increased storage capacity versus single disk offer fault tolerance performance benefit RAID device
Another RAID alternative concatenation spanning
This practice combining multiple disk drive appear single drive
Spanning increase storage capacity drive however JBOD spanning provide reliability speed benefit
RAID confused data backup
Although RAID level provide redundancy expert advise utilizing separate storage system backup disaster recovery purpose
In order set RAID array need group disk drive either software hardware controller
Software RAID run directly server utilizing server resource
As result may cause application run slowly
Most include RAID management capability
You also set RAID array adding server desktop PC
The RAID controller run essentially software us processor instead system CPU
Some le expensive fake RAID controller provide RAID management software separate processor
Alternatively purchase RAID array storage vendor
These appliance generally include two RAID controller group disk housing
Using RAID array usually different using kind primary storage
The RAID management handled hardware software controller generally invisible end user
established
In effort promote interoperability among different RAID vendor defines data distributed across disk RAID device
Another industry group called RAID Advisory Board worked promote RAID technology group longer active

information originally recorded analog method see
Similarly used analog recording method
In music industry analog recording mostly replaced digital technology data recorded digital format optical information
The first commercial digital disk storage device shipped part computing system
The storage disk developed complement already used storage provided using
Vigorous innovation disk storage technology coupled le vigorous innovation tape storage reduced difference acquisition cost per disk storage tape storage however total cost ownership data disk including power management remains larger tape
Disk storage used computer storage consumer electronic storage video disc
Data modern disk stored fixed length block usually called varying length hundred many thousand byte
Gross disk drive capacity simply number disk surface time number time number
In certain data stored magnetic disk variable length block called record record length could vary disk
Capacity decreased record length decreased due necessary gap block
Digital disk drive
Each disk divided logical collection sector
Blocks addressed using LBA
Read writing disk happens granularity block
Originally disk capacity quite low improved one several way
Improvements mechanical design manufacture allowed smaller precise head meaning track could stored disk
Advancements data compression method permitted information stored individual sector

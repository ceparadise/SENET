I Googled long time I still understand work explanation technical illustration make clearer
My primary confusion virtual memory
I hope question good explanation people ask question find Google
I admit two concept seem quite complicated similar beginning
Sometimes also taught confusingly
A good reference opinion found For sake completion I try explain I guarantee correctness I developed OS month
Segmentation older concept opinion confusing
Segmentation work name say
A segment continuous block memory specific size
To access memory within segment need
This make total two address component fact stored two register
One idea segmentation enlarge memory register
The sort protection elaborate one paging
Because use two register access memory split memory chunk said called segment
Consider memory
This split bit register segment byte
Of course also bit register offset
Addressing byte bit quite useless decided segment overlap I think also performance programming reason back
The following formula used access memory segmentation This mean segment time offset
This also mean address accessed many way
also
This segmentation old day
If look assembler program try something see even called register assembler CS DS code segment data segment
Later called GDT introduced
This global table specific position RAM segment number memory address several option segment given
This brings u nearer concept paging still
So programmer decide segment start
A new concept also GDT one could decide long segment
So segment long bit register limit could defined programmer
You could overlapping segment also purely separated segment
When accessing A B still two register used accessing memory A entry GDT
So look entry GDT see memory location segment start large
We check B offset within allowed memory area
Now paging different newer segmentation approach paging page fixed size
So limit longer programmable page currently
Furthermore unlike segmentation logical address space continuous without physical address continuous
Paging also us table look stuff still split logical address part
The first part number entry page table second part offset
However offset fixed length bit access
You also two part multiple page table used
Two level page table quite common system I think even three level page table common
I hope I able explain least bit I think exaplanation also confusing
Best thing dive kernel programming try implement basic stuff booting OS
Then find everything due backwards compability everything still modern PCs
I direct Segmentation starting die
I suspect paging well future
Edit Let add clarification Segmentation paging two difference mean memory management typically two thing
At risk oversimplification Segmentation allows process access memory natural pointer size would allow
Paging allows process access memory system physically support
Segments The bit system
That allows addressing memory
Late system much memory
A process could map different segment physical memory
A process could access memory could change memory could access within
The successor brought segmenting high art
Using even complex system base register process could access larger area memory
Paging Is system process see continuous relatively range memory address divided page
For example VAX processor bit address allowing access memory theoretically computer typically memory
A process could access much memory system physically plus multiple process
These system presented continuous range memory process virtual memory divided page around byte defined set table mapped disk storage
If process accessed page memory triggered hardware exception
The operating system would intercept exception allocate new page physical memory load memory disk restart instruction
If operating system needed memory handle request would page memory already loaded
If data read usually would loaded executable image would paged
The page could marked invalid
If memory page would written page file storage needed
The Intel chip introduced bizarre system combined segment paging
Segments used data protection
The processor mode away

division
In computer system using segmentation reference memory location includes value identifies segment within segment
Segments section also used compiled program together image memory
Segments usually correspond natural division program individual routine data table segmentation generally visible programmer paging alone
Different segment may created different program different class memory usage
Certain segment may shared program
In system using segmentation computer memory address consist segment id offset within segment
A hardware MMU responsible translating segment offset performing check make sure translation done reference segment offset permitted
Each segment length set permission example associated
A allowed make reference segment type reference allowed permission offset within segment within range specified length segment
Otherwise raised
Segments may also used implement
In case segment associated flag indicating whether present main memory
If segment accessed present main memory exception raised read segment memory secondary storage
Segmentation one method implementing
another combined
The size memory segment generally fixed may small single
Segmentation implemented several different way different hardware without paging
Intel fit either model discussed separately also greater detail separate article
Associated segment information indicates segment located
When program reference memory location offset added segment base generate physical memory address
An implementation virtual memory system using segmentation without paging requires entire segment swapped back forth main memory secondary storage
When segment swapped operating system allocate enough contiguous free memory hold entire segment
Often result enough contiguous memory even though may enough total
Instead actual memory location segment information includes address segment
When program reference memory location offset translated memory address using page table
A segment extended simply allocating another memory page adding segment page table
An implementation system using segmentation paging usually move individual page back forth main memory secondary storage similar paged system
Pages segment located anywhere main memory need contiguous
This usually result reduced amount primary secondary storage reduced memory fragmentation
The computer one first implement segmentation perhaps first commercial computer provide virtual memory based segmentation
The later computer also implemented segmentation version architecture still use today Unisys ClearPath Libra server
The computer modification segmentation paging support added designed support
The begun attempted implement true segmented architecture memory protection microprocessor
computer use memory segmentation
The memory segmentation used early processor beginning provide protection
Any program running processor access segment restriction
A segment identified starting location length checking
Segmentation later provides protection introduction Intel retroactively named sole operating mode previous CPU model introduced new protection feature
For backward compatibility CPUs start real mode memory protection fixed KiB segment KiB addressing
An later processor must switched another mode software order use full address space advanced MMU feature
In implementation segmentation segment table rather pointing page table segment contains segment address
This address mapped physical address using separate page table
Unlike paged implementation segmentation prevents segment dynamically growing size
The architecture use segmentation long mode mode
Four segment register CS SS DS ES forced limit
The segment register FS GS still nonzero base address
This allows operating system use segment special purpose

Segmentation Definition Breaking packet smaller piece transmitter
This may necessary restriction communication channel
The piece joined back together right order receiver
Segmentation may performed router routing packet network smaller maximum packet size

The following problem final I understand solve Different method memory management different overhead What relation among overhead concurrent execution process
P S T b S P c S T T S P This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
I guessing overhead P S T exclude per overhead overhead overhead adjustment obvious overhead process would P byte paging S byte segmentation T byte byte segmentation paging
The inclusion maximum segment size confusing since insufficient information provided determine segment process larger KB though one segment
Since mean segment size significantly le maximum allowed size I assume segment need use two segment table entry
It might help clarify equation substitute A B C A B C greater zero
It straightforward determine value needed equality derive condition memory management method greater overhead negative value course impossible

To use processor facility efficiently desirable maintain many process possible main memory
In addition desirable free programmer size restriction program development restrict small size happened older computer
The restriction predefined size redirects programmer effort use better programming technique continuously effort make fit size solution necessarily optimal one
The way address concern virtual memory VM
Virtual memory system abstraction primary memory von Neumann computer
Even time decreasing physical memory cost contemporary computer devote considerable resource supporting virtual address space much larger physical memory allocated process
Contemporary software relies heavily virtual memory support application image management huge memory requirement

To basic approach providing virtual memory paging segmentation
Paging
With paging process divided relatively small page
Paging system transfer block information primary secondary memory
Because fixed page size page frame size translation binary virtual address corresponding physical address relatively simple provided system efficient table lookup mechanism
Paging system use associative memory implement page translation table
Paging us address like used address cell within particular segment
In paging virtual address space linear sequence virtual address format differs hierarchical segmentation address space
In paging system programmer specific mechanism informing virtual memory system logical unit virtual address space done segmentation
Instead virtual memory manager completely responsible defining unit transfer page moved back forth primary secondary memory
The programmer need aware unit virtual address space loaded unloaded physical memory
In fact page size transparent process
Philip
Segmentation
Segmentation provides use piece varying size
It also possible combine segmentation paging single scheme
Segmentation alternative paging
It differs paging unit transfer primary secondary memory varies
The size segment also explicitly known programmer
Translating segment virtual address physical
Segmentation extension idea suggested use register relocating bound checking block memory
The program part loaded unloaded defined programmer segment
Segment may defined explicitly language directive implicit program semantics text data stack segment created UNIX C compiler
Address complex translating paging virtual address

The address space stored different part machine memory hierarchy execution
No external fragmentation Segments grow without reshuffling Can run process page swapped disk Increases flexibility sharing Decreases size page table If segment used need page table Increases flexibility sharing Share either single page entire segment Overhead accessing memory Page table reside main memory Overhead reference every real memory reference Large page table Must allocate page table contiguously More problematic address bit Page table size Assume bit segment bit page number bit offset Algorithm block memory card side cache line
Method Which country necessary define cache block busy
Three technique used direct associative associative
In associative mapping request made cash requested address compared directory entry directory
If requested address found directory hit appropriate place cache fetched returned processor otherwise miss occurs
figure
Address length bit Number addressable unit word byte Block Size line size word byte Number block main memory Number line cache undetermined Size tag bit Flexibility block replace new block read cache Replacement algorithm designed maximize cache hit ratio Complex circuitry required examine tag cache line parallel In direct mapping cache Lower Row address bit used access directory
Several address line card place cache directory upper address bit tag bit compared address ensure hit
If comparison valid result cache miss simply miss
The address given cache processor actually subdivided several piece different role accessing data figure
Direct Mapping Cache Figure Philip Operates fashion somewhat similar cache
Bits line address used address cache directory
However multiple choice two four complete line address may present directory
Each line address corresponds location
The collection form total cache array
In set associative cache cache accessed simultaneously together cache directory
If entry cache directory match reference address hit particular array selected gated back processor figure William No choice Each block map one line Must replace line Must implemented hardware speed
Most effective Least Recently Used LRU Replace block set cache longest reference
set associative line includes USE bit
FIFO Replace block set cache longest
Uses circular buffer technique
Least Frequently Used LFU
Replace block set experienced fewest reference
Associate counter line Pick line random based usage
Only slightly inferior performance algorithm based usage
The basic idea RAID Redundant Array Independent Disks combine multiple cheap disk array disk drive obtain performance capacity reliability exceeds large disk
The array drive appears host computer one logical drive
The Mean Time Between Failure MTBF array equal MTBF individual drive divided number drive array
Because MTBF array RAID low system
However disk array made fault tolerant redundantly storing information various way
Five type array architecture RAID RAID originally determined provides disk fault tolerance different compromise feature performance
In addition five redundant array architecture become popular refer array disk drive RAID array
RAID fastest efficient array type offer fault tolerance
RAID requires minimum two drive
William
Increasing Logical Drive Performance Without array controller connecting extra physical disk system increase total storage capacity
However effect efficiency operation data transferred one physical disk time see Figure
With array controller connecting extra physical disk system increase total storage capacity efficiency
The capacity several physical disk combined one virtual unit called logical drive also called logical volume
The head physical disk logical drive active simultaneously improving performance reducing total time required data transfer see Figure
William Because head physical disk active simultaneously amount data written disk given time interval
Each unit data called block
The block form set data stripe spread evenly physical disk logical drive see Figure William
For data logical drive readable data block sequence must every stripe
This sequencing process performed Smart Array Controller sends data block physical disk writing head correct order
In striped array physical disk logical drive contains amount data
If one physical disk larger capacity physical disk logical drive extra capacity used
A logical drive extend one channel controller extend one controller
Disk failure although rare potentially catastrophic array
If physical disk fails logical drive assigned fails data logical drive lost

RAID fastest efficient array type offer fault tolerance
RAID requires minimum two drive
RAID best choice environment
RAID choice two drive used
RAID seldom used today since ECC embedded hard drive
RAID supported Adaptec RAID controller
RAID used speed data transfer provide fault tolerance environment access long sequential record
However RAID allow overlapping multiple operation requires drive avoid performance degradation short record
Because RAID small stripe size offer
Similar performance RAID supported Adaptec RAID controller
RAID offer advantage RAID support multiple simultaneous write operation
RAID supported Adaptec RAID controller
RAID combine efficient data storage good performance characteristic
However write performance performance drive failure slower RAID
Rebuild operation also require time parity information also reconstructed
At least three drive required RAID array
Striped data dual distributed parity except us second level independently calculated distributed parity information additional fault tolerance
This extra fault tolerance provides data security event two drive fail drive replaced
While RAID level provide greater fault tolerance level significant loss write performance due requirement storing parity twice write operation
A configuration also requires drive accommodate additional parity data make le cost effective equivalent storage capacity
RAID Stripe set mirrored array RAID also called RAID combination RAID level
In type implementation stripe set data created across array performance benefit
A duplicate first stripe set mirrored another array fault tolerance
While configuration provides performance benefit redundancy level costly implement minimum four disk necessary create RAID configuration
NOTE A RAID configuration continue operation even two disk failed provided two disk part mirror set
RAID Stripe set parity array RAID level also called RAID combination RAID level
Multiple array striped together using
Parity maintained separately group striped array
This level provides advantage small data transfer added performance striping disk operation
Also parity calculated independently component one array degraded effect overall operation significant single array
However overhead incurred parity generation still present
Normally cause noticeable degradation unless dependent XOR functionality large number disk array
RAID subsystem support XOR provide performance nearly equal configuration added protection data parity information event disk failure
A minimum six disk required RAID configuration
NOTE A RAID configuration continue operation even two disk failed provided two disk part parity group

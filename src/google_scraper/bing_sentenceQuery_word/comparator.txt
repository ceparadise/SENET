Generic sorting algorithm generally take set data sort comparator function compare two individual element
If comparator order output algorithm sorted
I wondering though sort algorithm would actually comparator order relation particular one return random result comparison
By work I mean continue return permutation input run typically quoted time complexity opposed degrading worst case scenario always going infinite loop missing element
The ordering result would undefined however
Even better resulting ordering would uniform distribution comparator coin flip
From rough mental calculation appears merge sort would fine maintain runtime cost produce fair random ordering
I think something like quick sort would however degenerate possibly finish fair
What sorting algorithm merge sort would work described random comparator
For reference comparator order relation proper function deterministic satisfies axiom order relation Assume input element distinct reflexivity issue
A random comparator violates rule
There however comparators order relation yet random example might violate perhaps one rule particular element set
So basically want know sorting algorithm would degrade average case given compare function similar method produce integer specified inclusive lower upper bound
The answer actually basic sorting algorithm perform according average case obey least one following two condition For instance SelectionSort iterates unsorted element find least greatest element comparing one greatest far place correct position repeat
As result even comparator end every iteration algorithm found value think least greatest swap element position trying determine never considers element thus obeys Condition
However A B compared multiple time process extreme example consider several pass SelectionSort array sorted reverse order violates Condition
MergeSort obeys Condition merged element left right side compared already determined element side array order among algorithm compare least unmerged element subarray determine lesser go next merged list
This mean two unique object A B compared maximum one time given element final index full collection known algorithm complete
InsertionSort obeys Condition well even though overall strategy complexity look like SelectionSort
Each unsorted element compared sorted element one found le element inspection
element inserted point next element considered
The result relative order A B determined one comparison comparison A B never performed final position element known element considered
QuickSort obeys Conditions
At level pivot chosen arranged left side contains element le pivot right side contains element greater pivot
The result level QuickSort left pivot QuickSort right basically mean position pivot element known one index greater length left side pivot never compared element chosen pivot may compared previous pivot element element also known included subarrays AND A B end opposite side pivot never compared
In implementation pure QuickSort base case one element point current index final index comparison made
The comparative sort I think would obey either condition BubbleSort
If sort accept X greatest element proper place running X pass us pas verify list sorted sort considered done random comparator returned every two adjacent element list pas thus swap performed event truly random would occur probability relatively small list element one chance element probability
As maximum absolute value result comparator increase probability one comparison return negative zero decrease towards making chance end algorithm much le likely chance coin flip landing head basically boil There sort designed specifically example incorporate random comparator perhaps famous BogoSort
Given list list order shuffle list check
Theoretically hit right permutation value like BubbleSort average case N birthday problem enough random permutation become likely encounter duplicate permutation unique one nonzero possibility algorithm never completing officially algorithm
Any algorithm compare two element twice clever algorithm particular algorithm would perform le well quicksort
Any algorithm compare pair element average runtime cost regardless behavior compare function
Otherwise least guarantee sorting algorithm worse running time le O decent sorting algorithm
I believe interesting question algorithm would perform compare function gave right answer say case average
By well would perform mean answer question average number misplaced item sorting list size n algorithm
Edit The problem interesting I first thought comment Suppose compare function compare x probability false probability also
Recall insertion sort functional style algorithm The average running time algorithm n f k n length l f k average running time insert list length k count application cost count destruction well formula similar
Now compare described quite small mean number step performed insertion given k This give average running time O insertion sort significantly better O given decent comparison function
It would fun work average running time different algorithm given uniform compare function
Mergesort fair random comparator fair
I proof I VERY strong empirical evidence
Fair mean uniformly distributed

I came across word report International Monetary Fund title woman save Japan Chad Steinberg Masao Nakane FLP rate similar comparator country woman early twenty participation rate drop sharply woman late twenty As I never heard word country company I checked Google Search found definition Computer terminology Dictionary Generic term precision measurement
Comparative measurement device determine length object comparing measuring object standard scale using microscope
Free Encyclopedia Electronics term An element switch power output comparing two different voltage electric current
The word also applied apparatus compare two different data
A device designed measuring minimum length extreme precision
Comparative measurement instrument determine difference length object standard gauge using high powered
Interface class comparison processing
To none definition seems applicable quoted line FLP rate similar comparator country woman early At time I believe writer authoritative organization like IMF make misuse word
So mean
Does mean object country research simply country surveyed specific survey
Is usage word comparative vital statistic even daily conversation
If possible like listen specific opinion statistic specialist
I could find article actually term noun used relation economic issue meaning
I think may figurative use term commonly used context
Though common term used economic financial context UK US noun C organization activity etc
used judge performance another similar organization activity Â The comparators Infobank Ariba Commerce One three provide online software
Defining scope economic evaluation study selection
The present study describes key component used defining scope economic evaluation study selecting comparators

An apparent lack similar case shaped observer compare integration Europe region
however overlooked three decade sustained economic integration Australia New Zealand
Of online dictionary I ordinarily consult best fit usage question
Something used standard comparison None definition listed anything statistic
It certainly word hear everyday conversation

astronomy measuring device whose operation based principle comparing two spectrogram like one taken standard
There several type comparators distinguished purpose method comparison
Some comparators compare second pulse clock time contact micrometer tape recorded transit instrument
In measuring tape comparators distance second impulse clock standard
In spectrocomparators spectrogram star compared displacement one another group spectral line belonging one star group line belonging another star laboratory light source measured
In way radial velocity specific star established radial velocity reference star comparison star known
Comparators also include certain instrument help detect change occurred celestial body done comparing two astrophotographs spectrogram obtained different time
Such comparators blink comparators comparison accomplished alternately looking two photograph blinking
In stereocomparators change position celestial object relative object revealed simultaneously looking two astrophotographs mean stereoscopic image shift
I measuring instrument used compare linear quantity measure scale
A comparator measure difference two quantity whose nominal magnitude close provides high precision measurement
A comparator may used compare dimension object measured distance line standard scale line comparator end block end comparator
Instruments different type also use comparative method sometimes also called comparators example interference comparator
Measuring device used comparators include microscope vernier scale optical eyepiece micrometer photoelectric microscope digital readout interferometer
Lengths measured comparators range fraction millimeter dozen meter
Comparators used metrology comparing length standard long machine building checking part dimension geodesy

Comparator interface used order object class
A comparator object capable comparing two object two different class
Following function compare Suppose class type containing field like rollno name address DOB etc need sort array based Roll name
One obvious approach write sort function using one standard algorithm
This solution requires rewriting whole sorting code different criterion like Roll No
Name
Using comparator Comparator interface used order object class
This interface present package contains method compare Object Object equal Object element
Using comparator sort element based data member
For instance may rollno name age anything else
Method Collections class sorting List element used sort element List given comparator
Internally Sort method call Compare method class sorting
To compare two element asks Which greater Compare method return say le equal greater
It us result determine swapped sort
Output By changing return value inside compare method sort order want
descending order change position b compare method

Is lower bound known size constant depth circuit expressing digital comparator two n number
Two n binary number compared using
The straightforward way implement circuit compare bit continue compare second significant bit
This circuit size measured number gate roughly quadratic n linear depth
By standard argument folded equivalent circuit roughly size logarithmic depth n
In fact depth circuit size O sufficient digital comparator unbounded gate allowed see Heribert Vollmer Exercise
Is tight lower bound known
Comparison implemented subtracting number testing whether significant bit
Subtraction implemented addition x obtained flipping bit
Addition implemented using
If put together I think get comparison circuit us O n gate constant depth
In particular let generate propagate carry
This let compute carry significant bit O n gate
That need result comparison need compute value bit sum
The reason requires fewer gate full addition full subtraction need carry significant bit carry bit
reasoning I could gone awry somewhere

I looking Java equivalent python snippet I want something standard like Is way since I want write one class every comparator
I tried following code unsuccessfully depScores variable readable comparator
Looks like java inner class access variable outside
Thanks advance
Just declare final variable
If reason ca create second final variable point
Local class capture variable final
As late addendum trivial create custom lambda Java You get even terse replacing lambda method reference
The rule capturing local variable like little flexible lambda inner class captured variable need
In word must assigned exactly though need explicitly marked
What want possible JavaÂ even shorter For previous Java version use Problems circumvented assigning final variable right invocation But I think even straightforward efficient following helper method require hash lookup By posting answer agree

method available java collection class class
This method also declared interface purpose declaring method Comparator
case used
purpose declaring method Comparator
I think designer way highlighting fact imposes class implement interface Additionally method return specified object also comparator imposes ordering comparator
Thus implies every object reference
The method used establish whether two distinct comparators impose order
I think main reason make clear method testing
This obvious think I imagine people might expect somehow semantically related method
It also allows documentation guideline two comparators could viewed equal
Either way presence method interface documentation purpose
From javadoc Note safe override Object
However overriding method may case improve performance allowing program determine two distinct comparators impose order
The idea simply able allow sort collection already sorted another comparator realize end result
Generally little use sorting large collection something might want look
declaring Comparator compared another Object argument It form Object equal method let know two object comparator type
As per question I think It used compare object converting string
Object class eqlas method chek Object eqls And Competres method chek object data like hello By posting answer agree

I need sensing current circuit cutting power current exceeds threshold
It seems everything I read recommends using separate current sense amplifier voltage comparator package I would think need common someone would manufacture device package
Board space limited I need access intermediate analog signal two device
I already tried using voltage comparator seem sensitive enough detect small voltage difference across current sense resistor
The device need operate supply
I setting absolute max voltage device rated
This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason If must use current sense amp comparator rather eFuse something like TI make quite device could work application

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

In read range tip suggestion help manage money effective manner
persistent term area industry meaning project manager take existing documented process organization arsenal tailor adjust current specific need example suit ongoing project
The result effort usually captured project planning documentation explaining part standard process utilized along accepted divergence original plan certain process
Process tailoring add flexibility speed ability organization response new business challenge adopting new project
It economizes time enabling manager invent document every process scratch rather tailor make comparably small change process process template
The flexible unitary template easier project team design tailor solution suiting new specific need hence advisable organization implement process model enabling maximal level administrative flexibility

Tailoring often performed ad hoc manner
Determining stage step artifact process necessary challenging
SE guidebook across industry government organization often stress importance tailoring yet offer little practical guidance perform function
This article proposes model automating SE tailoring process definition organizational rule set minimal set input
The model analyzed several case study within Department Homeland Security evaluate proposed approach
Most organization develop system engineering SE guideline specify stage review artifact executed project
Standard process important today project employ standardized terminology may prevent project team reinventing wheel however formal informal process must balanced yield efficiency gained standardization effectiveness gained adaptability Laufer
Since two project identical two process either Humphrey
Organizations must develop tailorable guideline broad enough span range project within portfolio Hwang Park
This place burden tailoring organization SE guideline project system engineer
This article proposes approach partially automating activity thereby reducing manual burden yet still offering significant number custom SE process variation best meet project need

This approach leverage preformed methodology
Hanssen Westerheim Bjørnson use brainstorming tailor software process organization
Baldassarre Caivano Visaggio Visaggio propose use pattern software process tailoring
As previously stated significant amount research exists process tailoring software engineering field
While similar research exists SE process tailoring opportunity exists apply software engineering research SE
By proposing model simplifies SE process tailoring article seek bridge gap SE literature SE process research stress importance tailoring yet offer little guidance perform function practitioner perform SE process tailoring meet specific need project
The proposed approach SE process tailoring offer significant number custom SE process variation compared preformed approach without reliance deep repository required approach
With proposed approach number tailoring decision could reduced total number element governing SE process number rule established within SE organization applied project
The next section article proposes SE Process Tailoring Model SEPTM developed starting tailoring consideration identified INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook published International Council Systems Engineering INCOSE used generate SE process based project unique characteristic environment
The discussion SEPTM followed section introduces analysis case study within Department Homeland Security DHS thereby evaluating model real world SE process tailoring instance
Finally article highlight conclusion research area future work
Figure present overview proposed SEPTM
At high level author constructed model based analysis generic SE process described INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook influence process tailoring
This analysis form basis initial set Tailoring Considerations TC
From initial set TCs subset selected applicable particular organization
A rule set developed link TCs organizational SE process
A system engineer apply rule set unique attribute project generate customized SE process based condition particular project
The following subsection describe activity
An important aspect model determining TCs used identify critical aspect project
The TCs broadly inform SE activity needed given project
The development initial organizational TC list based analysis general SE process described INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook discussion consideration enablers process tailoring INCOSE
The handbook state appropriate approach vary based unique need project
It also describes various approach including waterfall incremental agile approach
In waterfall approach project team performs SE stage serially incremental approach project team performs SE stage serially multiple time agile approach project team iterates short development cycle frequent product release Aoyama
As part agile development cycle project team perform SE stage requirement definition design development testing iterative fashion
Moreover project team perform update associated review documentation release Cao Ramesh
Each approach varies term stage review frequency well amount documentation required
As result project approach must critical TC
The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook also describes technical method includes section specialty engineering analysis must considered project system engineer however analysis apply every project INCOSE
For example interoperability considered project interface project
An organization may specific artifact required address interoperability certain project allow deleting interoperability artifact based project type
The handbook tailoring section includes discussion SE process tailoring identifies consideration enablers tailoring project scope risk tolerance complexity precedence system policy infrastructure INCOSE
While handbook identifies risk tolerance factor process tailoring advise importance placing tailoring emphasis system project objective project scope
Analysis general SE process tailoring discussion INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook resulted following list TCs Of TCs first Approach Project Scope Complexity Precedence System Policies organization INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook suggests
The remaining vary applicability depending type project organization executes
This requires organization determine appropriate subset TCs project portfolio
In second analytical step overarching TC list reduced one includes TCs relevant organization
This step performed comparing TC list organizational policy organizational SE process
For TC possible value identified
The TCs value either environmental impact need considered multiple approach may waterfall incremental agile
The case study next section article offer detailed discussion step performed
Before tailoring rule set developed tailoring operation must defined
For purpose research following definition apply Once TCs selected organization tailoring condition defined rule set must generated link TCs associated value element organization standard SE process
Process element SE task activity identified within organization SE process
Table show matrix used establish rule set
In area table element M standard SE process listed vertically
For example DHS SE process process element M
In area TC N associated value O listed horizontally
N represents number TCs identified organization value represent potential attribute project within organization
As example TC Interoperability Analysis potential value would yes given system may connected
For intersection process element combination area tailoring rule established
This requires two level decision
First determination made whether TC relevant particular process element second determination made value TC whether process element kept standard tailored deleted
Thus relevant intersection area contain either S standard T tailored D deleted
In summary resulting rule set list TCs value drive tailoring decision standard tailored deleted every relevant process element within organizational SE process
Once model developed organization project system engineer use tailoring SE process meet need specific project
To system engineer must solid understanding acquisition strategy project environment
This true whether applying methodology case tailoring SE process ad hoc fashion
To exercise model system engineer must align characteristic project value associated TC
Once complete model output tailored SE process identifying full set organization SE process element executed standard tailored deleted
After model applied situation organization must incorporate lesson learned back model reassessing organization list TCs organization rule set
Moreover SE research constantly refining best practice industry standard updated organization must also revisit initial TC set ass change industry
The objective research use project attribute approach reduce amount manual tailoring SE life cycle
et al
note determining best project methodology requires specific tailoring project unique situation
Measuring benefit activity based amount effort required tailor standard process Xu Ramesh
For purpose analysis article extends definition number manual decision required produce SE process
By design model fix number decision number TCs established organization
If organization applies initial TCs number manual decision
The DHS organization large acquisition portfolio SE process consisting process element resulting associated process tailoring decision DHS
Provided model reproduce tailoring decision made within DHS case study potential benefit proposed approach SE process tailoring demonstrated reducing manual decision described following subsection number TCs determined DHS case study
As following subsection focus accuracy model comparison case study
To perform case study analysis author required two key element
First organization SE policy required serve process baseline
The baseline used establish linkage overarching TCs process element contained within baseline
The data source research DHS Systems Engineering Lifecycle Process Guide DHS
The DHS SE process identifies nine SE stage technical review artifact executed life project total SE process element
The second key element required set tailored SE process implemented project within organization
The author selected DHS project analysis based data availability variability across TCs Table
For example project executed full research development others COTS acquisition executed waterfall development approach others incremental agile
The author gathered analyzed quantitative data regarding tailoring outcome project compared actual modeled tailoring outcome
The first step applying tailoring model organization determine subset overarching TCs applicable organization
As stated previously first four TCs apply organization adapted DHS TC list
Analysis DHS policy yielded additional consideration pertaining privacy intelligence
Additional analysis DHS SE process performed determine remaining applicable
Of five applicable project per DHS SE process five discussed DHS SE process guide five may apply depending need specific project
The five TCs may applicable included organizational TCs model
As result organizational TCs identified applied research follows With organizational TCs place rule set DHS established linking TCs standard DHS SE process depicted Table
Note given TC subset process element relevant empty table entry reflect relevance TC intersecting standard SE process element
For example Table four TCs relevant process element No

With rule set established DHS described previously next step input attribute project model generate custom SE process project
Figure depicts example project input output highlighting input addressing TCs based project characteristic output tailoring decision element within DHS SE process
Three question formed analysis TC
Table list question provides corresponding example using Security TC
The author assessed TCs comparing model output project data project SE process tailoring plan
A default process established based default project attribute within rule set
Projects attribute different default compared model particular attribute
For example default project attribute Security TC No therefore project security impact compared model ass whether project performed process element relevant TC
For given pairing process element tailoring consideration tailoring decision generated model project match tailoring decision actually executed project
For project security impact model project data include plan execute disaster recovery plan process element
For given pairing process element tailoring consideration percentage match project data corresponding model output exists
For project security impact percentage project included plan execute disaster recovery plan process element model suggests
What percentage process element least matching model output actual project data
What percentage process element relevant Security TC match model output actual project data
Table summarizes case study analysis approach using Security TC example
Questions listed Table trace Table
Column represents process element relevant Security TC
Column show tailoring decision model Security TC relevant process element next set column show pertinent data project assessment whether match model
The last column table calculates percentage project match model process element
Consistent validation study software engineering practice percent acceptable matching level used Daneva Ahituv Krishnan Kellner Ramasubbu Krishnan Kompalli
Thus TC considered valid model output relevant process element must match least percent relevant project last column Table least percent process element linked TC must meet threshold
This process described Security TC repeated TCs
Before presenting specific result case study analysis following key point must noted Table show result analysis comparing relevant project model output
The number project particular attribute provided
Overall result show nine TCs used reduce amount manual tailoring particular project
The one exception Project Size TC
As discussed previously limited specific research regarding application SE based project size specifically small project
Laporte Alexandre Renault discus need developing international standard address need small development organization one objective provide harmonized documentation integrating standard work product deliverable
This naturally extends SE within small organization large organization small project portfolio
Our analysis showed low correlation exists model small project case study
This occurred following project tailored process element recommended model project team executed average percent relevant process element
As result small size project leveraged opportunity tailor process element
Process tailoring critical effectively efficiently executing SE based unique characteristic project
Many SE process recommend tailoring supported tailoring guideline
This article examines previous research process tailoring software literature SE standard certain type project proposes model SE process tailoring
Our comparison SEPTM model several case study within DHS show process tailoring coupled project attribute viable approach reducing amount manual tailoring required given project
While research objective accomplished development initial model additional research performed area SE process tailoring

Matthew Kreuter Celette Sugg Skinner Tailoring name Volume Issue February Pages Download citation file Oxford University Press Health Education Research taken lead publishing finding recent wave study reporting effect tailored health education intervention
However journal elsewhere considerable variation meant descriptor
As growing number health education researcher practitioner added language tailoring vocabulary possibility tailoring repertoire intervention method increasingly important field provide clear definition tailoring seek standardize related terminology
We would like suggest tailoring defined follows Any combination information change strategy based characteristic unique person related outcome interest
The word tailor come Latin word meaning cut
Its common usage today make adapt fit particular clothing
Although found us term tailoring published literature betray meaning clearly different interpretation operational definition concept
Appropriately author describe tailoring process specially creating intervention material activity
The detail process typically fall one two category
The first corresponds closely clothing custom fit size style particular person
The second corresponds nearly process target marketing appealing defined population subgroup expected like particular size style clothing
This latter approach may appropriately labeled rather tailored
Targeting involves development single intervention approach defined population subgroup take account characteristic shared subgroup member
These subgroup may small quite specifically defined woman aged belonging particular neighborhood health center
Targeting based upon advertising principle market segmentation aim find right kind consumer particular product service
Several recently published study contain similar example intervention nevertheless described tailored
For example Eakin colleague described tailoring process producing video whose content character adapted designed appeal particular target population Pasick described tailoring adaptation intervention best fit relevant need characteristic specified target population
In contrast targeting defined process creating individualized intervention material strategy
This approach also referred tailoring tailoring
The published literature contains number intervention study using tailoring approach In study researcher collected data individual regarding number psychosocial behavioral determinant used conceptually empirically based process person data generate customized feedback meet unique need
Although suggested intervention also tailored organization community would generally consider customization example targeting
Only characteristic organization measured addressed creating customized material change strategy directed towards would consider approach tailored
To illustrate distinction tailoring targeting consider following example health education intervention drawn recently published research
As part intervention approach used Project developed targeted educational booklet designed promote breast cervical cancer screening among Latinas San Francisco
To make booklet culturally appropriate population project member Wrote booklet sixth grade reading level Spanish
Used bright color bold graphic color photograph believed appeal group
Used Latina model demonstrate desired behavior visually explain message
Included testimonial member Latina community importance screening
Addressed fatalistic attitude misconception cause cancer
Given element booklet one might reasonably assume member target population characterized lower reading level speaking mostly Spanish liking bright bold color relating closely woman looked talked like holding certain culturally based belief related cancer cancer prevention
Thus booklet created basis characteristic
Print material woman cancer screening also developed using tailoring methodology
For example Skinner created tailored physician recommendation letter sent woman patient primary care setting
To participate eligible woman completed brief telephone survey assessing stage readiness perceived barrier perceived benefit getting mammogram
Based information plus demographic risk status data individualized letter generated sent woman home
Each letter contained drawing woman
The drawing tailored race age recipient
Below drawing testimonial caption tailored recipient stage readiness get mammogram
Text message letter addressed woman specific barrier getting mammogram belief mammography breast cancer stage readiness change breast cancer risk
In nearly different tailored letter could generated
In summary targeted booklet based aggregate profile specific population subgroup Latinas San Francisco produced one version specially designed subgroup
Its focus primarily characteristic assumed shared many member subgroup
On hand tailored physician recommendation letter mammography based upon specific characteristic individual woman within intervention population
Additionally different letter produced different woman
While message certainly could written reflect shared characteristic patient population focused instead unique characteristic woman
Both targeted tailored approach guided sound practice principle study demonstrated effective generic intervention take consideration characteristic offered
However important difference
In particular unit assessment subgroup versus individual type data collected usually demographic versus psychosocial use data collected using individual level data characterize subgroup versus using individual level data intervene specific individual final intervention content content member subgroup versus different content person quite dissimilar
As yet neither shown superior
In fact next year hope see new study comparing relative effectiveness tailored versus targeted intervention
For example study needed determine optimal segmentation strategy health education health communication
At one end continuum possible strategy lie audience segmentation would used develop material targeted black versus white men versus woman younger versus older person
At end continuum would lie ultimate segmentation tailoring segment one specific person
In extreme lie innumerable possibility combining different type variable yield different type size audience segment
At present little known difference development time cost effectiveness alternative
It important develop test review intervention able easily distinguish tailored targeted approach
Therefore field sought past point subtle important difference physician advice physician counseling intervention intervention simply take place community must recognize understanding terminology difference tailoring targeting

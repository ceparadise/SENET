method planning emphasizes people equipment physical space required execute project
It developed
It differs traditional method derive algorithm emphasize task order rigid scheduling
A critical chain project network strives keep resource levelled requires flexible start time
Critical chain project management based method algorithm derived
The idea CCPM introduced Eliyahu Goldratt book
Application CCPM credited achieving project faster cheaper traditional method CPM PERT Gantt etc
developed
According study traditional project management method others project typically finish time
Projects typically complete originally planned original budgeted cost project fall short planned technical content delivered cancelled completion CCPM try improve performance relative traditional statistic
With traditional project management method lost time resource typically consumed wasteful technique bad multitasking particular delay lack prioritization
In sequence task prevents completed shorter time given finite resource
If resource always available unlimited quantity project critical chain identical
Critical chain alternative
Main feature distinguish critical chain critical path CCPM planning aggregate large amount safety time added task within project protect performance avoid wasting safety time poorly synchronized integration
Critical chain project management us buffer management instead ass performance project
Some feel earned value management technique misleading distinguish progress project constraint critical chain progress A project plan WBS created much fashion critical path
The plan worked backward completion date task starting late possible
A duration assigned task
Some software implementation add second duration one best guess probability duration second safe duration higher probability completion perhaps depending amount risk organization accept
Other software implementation go duration estimate every task remove fixed percentage aggregated buffer
Resources assigned task plan using aggressive duration
The longest sequence task lead beginning end project identified critical chain
The justification using estimate half task finish early half finish late variance course project zero
Recognizing task likely take time le time due reason CCPM us buffer monitor project schedule financial performance
The extra duration task critical difference safe duration gathered buffer end project
In way buffer gathered end sequence task feed critical chain
The date end project buffer given external delivery date
Finally baseline established enables financial monitoring project
An alternate methodology us quantification duration using
In researcher applied simulation ass impact risk associated component project work breakdown structure project duration cost performance
Using Monte Carlo simulation project manager apply different probability various risk factor affect project component
The probability occurrence vary chance occurrence
The impact risk entered simulation model along probability occurrence
The number iteration Monte Carlo simulation depend tolerance level error provide density graph illustrating overall probability risk impact project outcome
When plan complete project ready start project network fixed buffer size locked planned duration may altered project used monitor project schedule financial performance
With slack duration individual task resource encouraged focus task hand complete hand next person group
The objective eliminate bad multitasking
This done providing priority information resource
The literature draw analogy relay race
Each element project encouraged move quickly running leg project focused completing assigned task quickly possible minimization distraction multitasking
In case study actual baton reportedly hung desk people working critical chain task others know interrupt
The goal overcome tendency delay extra work seems time
The CCPM literature contrast traditional project management monitor task start completion date
CCPM encourages people move quickly possible regardless date
Because task duration planned probability duration pressure resource complete critical chain task quickly possible overcoming student syndrome Parkinson Law
According proponent monitoring way greatest advantage Critical Chain method
Because individual task vary duration estimate point trying force every task complete time estimate never perfect
Instead monitor buffer created planning stage
A fever chart similar graph created posted show consumption buffer function project completion
If rate buffer consumption low project target
If rate consumption likely little buffer end project corrective action recovery plan must developed recover loss
When buffer consumption rate exceeds critical value roughly rate buffer may expected consumed end project resulting late completion alternative plan need implemented

Want watch later
Have ever tried run project go planned
Learn avoid issue come scheduling
scheduling method plan manages project focus allowing resource delay
Resources include internal external personnel contractor customer physical space logistics equipment
Critical chain project management look schedule includes resource availability see affect activity project completion
Think walking road
You might walking steady pace cement supplier bringing cement finish road delayed
The resource caused delay task
Eli Goldratt developed critical chain methodology book
Goldratt developed method due numerous project issue extended duration activity missed delivery budget overrun
When activity duration overestimated tendency worker fall student syndrome procrastinating Parkinson Law spreading task meet time allotted cherry picking task
If project fall trap buffer cushion built quickly disappear
There six step project manager us critical chain project management follow
Let say Judy project manager planning project

Determine Aggressive Estimates Judy always keep contracted delivery date forefront mind
To help fight procrastination effect Parkinson Law project manager determine activity duration aggressive
Some recommend normal activity time allotted reduced though consider aggressive obtainable

Create As Late As Possible Schedule Judy use scheduling software create schedule work backwards completion date activity starting latest possible start date
This contrast standard practice starting early possible
This tactic install sense urgency project team perform best ability

Determine Critical Chain Judy determine set activity delayed extend end date project
She determine based resource availability
All task critical chain part feeding chain

Decide Where Buffers Should Go Here Judy decide buffer placed schedule
Buffers one three type
Determine Buffer Sizes Here Judy add appropriate buffer size cushion activity duration
It recommended cushion proportionate activity uncertainty risk included
This mean uncertain activity larger buffer built

Add Buffers Schedule When Judy add buffer schedule creates buffered schedule use manage critical chain project
Judy begin use critical chain project management planning phase
She investigate personnel resource needed project discussing manager project need including resource required
She make sure include buffer cushion duration
Not resource available needed requested best look alternative issue arises
For example shop crane unavailable first shift free second shift Judy see using crane second shift
Get FREE access day create account
During execution Judy must look ahead resource needed availability commitment
Flawless execution help project come time budget
Ley say Sean project manager creation hour lemonade stand
As Sean planning project creates schedule evaluates resource need
Two high probability late
The first Johnny electrician best track record showing time tends procrastinate
The second resource lemon
The weather bad lately truck making delivery time
Sean make sure reduce time think take electrician half avoid Johnny procrastinating also add day buffer activity case late
As project move execution Sean keep contact Johnny let know needed day
The day Johnny arrive call Sean say day late
The extra day built paid
Sean slide extra day used electrician activity lemon delivery duration adding cushion
Sure enough delivery day late due weather
The cushion worked Sean delivered project time
focus resource delay factored project schedule
It also tends eliminate student syndrome Parkinson law cherry picking task come older method scheduling

Critical Chain VS Critical Path Method available

PMP Exam Preparation Study Materials Lessons Learned Contact Hours PMP FAQ etc
By We studied previous blog post used develop project schedule
This technique helped project manager manage project past
However today fast moving era project manager build aggressive realistic schedule time important resource costly may managing many project time requiring cross utilizing resource
In scenario past project manager difficulty managing schedule inherent drawback critical path method
These project poor response able complete time budgeted case terminated
The following issue faced project manager dealing schedule based critical path method
The first issue critical path model optimistic model assumes resource available time utilized whenever needed
However practically always possible
Many time assumption led delay project spending
Another issue critical path method misuse float slack
According Parkinson Law state work expands fill time available completion team member misuse slack causing project delayed
In critical path method even activity completed planned completion date time gain utilized next activity next activity wait early start date
Usually happens resource allocated next activity may available moment
However opposite true
If previous activity delayed delay passed next activity may cause delay project
In critical path method delay accumulate gain
The critical path method also infected Student Syndrome team member start task last moment
So see many problem schedule based critical path method
There need develop pragmatic approach build project schedule help project manager run project efficiently hence consequently critical chain method CCM came existence
The critical chain method CCM also known critical chain project management developed Eliyahu Goldratt
The critical chain defined longest path considering activity interdependence resource Path End critical chain
The critical path assumed particular case critical chain project access unlimited resource never run
In word say critical chain method modified form critical path method
Here availability resource considered creating project schedule
In critical chain project management instead float buffer used
These buffer designed way completely eliminate concept float slack
Three type buffer used critical chain management
These buffer follows This buffer placed last task project completion date buffer buffer act contingency critical chain activity
Any delay critical chain eat buffer project completion date remain unchanged
Also gain early finish activity gain added buffer well
Usually duration buffer contingency removed task estimate
This help move task project buffer
Please note although critical chain start beginning end start project buffer
It end end project
This duration include time duration borrowed project buffer exclude duration added buffer
Feeding buffer also calculated way project buffer
The duration buffer based fraction safety removed task chain
These buffer kept alongside critical chain make sure available required
This buffer human resource equipment
Please note since critical chain considers resource constraint well may longer critical path schedule
However might compensated removing contingency activity
Resources used critical chain known critical resource
People often get confused buffer float
They find two term similar however
The following difference float buffer I hope difference buffer float clear
Three step required create critical chain critical path
These step follows From procedure clearly see critical chain method modified form critical path method
Now let see real world example
Suppose get project construct building
You build schedule based critical path method start working
However execution project happen know What happen
Of course cause delay project
So problem
Did critical path identify resource required project
No critical path identified resource activity
So problem
What go wrong
The problem resource allocation
Although critical path identified resource account limited availability resource schedule
The project schedule developed optimistically assuming resource would available whenever needed
Unfortunately could happen case putting project trouble
Therefore solve issue made modification critical path considering limited resource availability
Now critical path converted critical chain realistic
And complete project confidence
Before blog post end let revisit key feature critical chain management There doubt critical chain method one important development project management made recently
This method answer many shortcoming critical path method provides realistic schedule encourages team member perform efficiently improves productivity
Critical chain method upgraded version critical path method practical approach developing project schedule
In critical chain method availability resource taken consideration drawing network diagram
In method use buffer instead float reduce mismanagement float seen critical path method
There doubt critical chain method one important development project management recently
This method answer many shortcoming critical path method provides realistic schedule encourages team member perform efficiently improves productivity
Here blog post critical chain management finish

However I suggest try finding good reference book amazon
I believe help implement critical chain concept project
Excellent explanation simplified add reader refer book Critical chain Goldratt concept explained story reading
I glad liked blog post
Thanks Jayahran visit
Thanks Fahad nice explanation concept
Here I would like take opportunity ask one thing
For Float hidden schedule people especially client dig sharing PDF version hard copy schedule strategy
But Buffers seems difficult hide PM I handle stakeholder strategically
So please make advice case
Regards Shafi I believe another benefit critical chain method
Thanks Fahad
This helpful
You welcome Vysakh
Fahed understood CCM methodology depend cutting contingency estimation time activity an sharing together put project buffer critical path added special buffer compensate shortage resource also depend cut contingency feeding resource put non critical path also methodology mean cut activity paste total time project right
Yes mean cut contingency put buffer
There buffer added critical path resource constraint also taken consideration Please read post understand critical path better How calculate time project buffer I confused please explain
thanks advance
This something calculate team member
You need expert judgement
Fahed thank reply believe misunderstand question understand critical path meaning still buffering CCM clear
kindly explain mind Thanks In critical chain add buffer accommodate resource constraint contingency

Creating realistic accurate schedule first step towards project success
In Project Scheduling PERT Critical Path Method CPM widely known method
Using CPM early Start Finish date Late Start Finish date calculated forward backward analysis project network diagram path
But method take resource limitation consideration
After identifying path resource picked leveled
In general activity owner add safety margin buffer activity order cope uncertainty
But cause time waste activity completed well estimated finish date
Critical Chain Method developed Eliyahu Goldratt schedule network analysis technique take account task dependency limited resource availability buffer
First step method identifying set activity result longest path project completion called critical chain
As includes resource consideration may longer CPM schedule
Resources used critical chain activity critical resource
Set activity chain converging critical chain feeder
Next step shortening project schedule reducing activity duration estimate effective buffer management
CCM focus eliminating project schedule delay due uncertainty overestimation task duration wasted internal buffer
In CPM even resource completes activity planned finish date time gain propagated next activity need wait till early start date next activity
But delay propagated may even change existing critical path
In example I showed activity dependency resource dependency across activity small project
Any delay Activity upper part fig delay entire project
Also see critical path Activity Activity though activity completed long Activity wait till activity completed
In project lower part fig resource used two different activity
Though completed time unit wait till finish time unit
Though critical path delay surely delay entire project due Resource dependency another longest path come picture Activity time unit
Hence optimization duration required concentrate activity dependency also resource dependency
Another important factor one need deal project scheduling safety margin buffer beat uncertainty
Due addition buffer different activity level difficult calculate exact time project execution safety margin go waste due
In CCM calculation based set activity critical chain hence estimated finish date activity much use
Also time gain delay activity fully passed throughout chain activity
The internal buffer added task made explicit summed
The summed value called project buffer
As per CCPM project buffer part project hence project duration remain unchanged even stripping activity safety margin
And keeping improves protection uncertainty
Also probability time estimate used calculating activity duration CCM instead traditional probability
Difference original schedule estimate new schedule estimate give project buffer
In general project scenario chance safety margin get exhausted poor buffer management
In CCM pooled project buffer used safeguard entire project even utilized allows project completion well within schedule
CCM introduces different buffer

Resource buffer
Feeding buffer
Project buffer
Out I discussed project buffer previously
Let give gist two buffer next
Resource buffer inserted critical chain activity ever critical resource required
This used give signal critical resource critical chain activity assigned due start shortly
According CCPM call cause critical resource wrap work ready start work critical chain task soon predecessor completed
The resource buffer actually consume resource add neither time cost project
Same like project buffer pooling activity safety margin chain applying end buffer placed path feed back critical chain path called feeding buffer
See placement feeding buffer fig

When come project lower limit possible lead time
This basically determines cost associated project
The critical chain project dependent task define lower limit possible lead time
Therefore safe assume critical chain made sequenced dependent task
In critical chain scheduling CCS dependent task scheduled effective beneficial way
When come critical chain scheduling dependency used determine critical chain
In case two type dependency used dependency resource dependency
This simply mean output one task input another
Therefore latter task started first task completed
In case one task utilizing resource task started first task completed resource freed
In simple using traditional project management terminology critical chain explained resource constrained critical path
Critical chain scheduling appreciates impact variation project
Usually project management impact variation found using statistical model PERT Mote Carlo analysis
Critical chain scheduling complement impact variance concept called buffer
We discus buffer later
The buffer basically protects critical chain variation chain making sure critical chain indeed critical
Buffer one interesting concept critical chain scheduling
The buffer constructed applied project order make sure success project
The buffer protects due delivery date variation critical chain
With feeding buffer proper size dependent task critical chain dependent output chain task great opportunity start task soon predecessor dependent task critical chain finished
Therefore feeding buffer dependent task critical chain wait chain task complete
This make sure critical chain move faster towards project completion
When multiple project running organization critical chain scheduling employ something called capacity buffer
These buffer used isolate key resource performance variance one project impacting another project
Resource buffer type buffer employed project order manage impact resource project progress
Usually critical path go start project end project
Instead critical chain end start buffer assigned project
This buffer called project buffer
This fundamental difference critical path critical chain
When come critical path activity sequencing performed
But critical chain critical chain scheduling performed
When come project schedule critical path subjective towards milestone deadline
In critical path much emphasis given resource utilization
Therefore many expert believe critical path get level resource project
One reason critical path dependency given precedence
When come critical chain defined set project task
Same critical path methodology software critical chain scheduling
This software categorized standalone category
This software support environment default
Therefore software useful come managing large project portfolio large organization
Critical chain scheduling methodology focused
Although dependent task mostly define project timeline resource utilization play key role
A methodology critical path may highly successful environment resource shortage
But reality case
Projects run limited resource critical factor come practicality
Therefore critical chain scheduling give better answer resource intensive project manage delivery

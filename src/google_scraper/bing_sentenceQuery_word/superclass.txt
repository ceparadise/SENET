Superclass computer science From Wikipedia free encyclopedia Jump navigation search In computer science superclass base class parent class class class derived
The class derived superclass known child class derived class subclass
A superclass allows generic interface include specialized functionality use virtual function
The superclass mechanism extensively used object oriented programming due reusability achieved common feature encapsulated modular object
Subclasses wish implement special behavior via virtual method without duplicate reimplement superclass behavior
Languages may support abstract concrete superclass

An important concept programming inheritance
It provides way define relationship
As name suggests object able inherit characteristic another object
In concrete term object able pas state behavior child
For inheritance work object need characteristic common
In class taken class taken others
This inherit feature class way topmost Object class
Let say make class called Human represents physical characteristic
It generic class could represent anyone world
Its state keep track thing like number leg number arm blood type
It behavior like eat sleep walk
Human good getting overall sense make u ca instance tell gender difference
For need make two new class type called Man Woman
The state behavior two class differ lot way except one inherit Human
Therefore inheritance allows u encompass parent class state behavior child
The child class extend state behavior reflect difference represents
The important aspect concept remember child class specialized version parent
In relationship two object superclass name given class inherited
It sound like super duper class remember generic version
Better name use might base class simply parent class
To take example time could superclass called Person
Its state hold person name address height weight behavior like go shopping make bed watch TV
We could make two new class inherit Person called Student Worker
They specialized version although name address watch TV go shopping also characteristic different
Worker could state hold job title place employment whereas Student might hold data area study institution learning
Imagine define Person class A new class created extending class The Person class said superclass Employee class
In relationship two object subclass name given class inheriting superclass
Although sound little drabber remember specialized version superclass
In previous example Student Worker subclass
Subclasses also known derived class child class extended class
You many subclass want
There limitation many subclass superclass
Likewise limitation number level inheritance
A hierarchy class built upon certain area commonality
In fact look Java API library see many example inheritance
Every class APIs inherited class called
For example time use JFrame object end long line inheritance In Java subclass inherits superclass known extending superclass
No
In Java subclass extend one superclass
Inheritance allows programmer reuse code already written
In Human class example need create new field Man Woman class hold blood type use one inherited Human class
Another benefit using inheritance let u treat subclass superclass
For example let say program created multiple instance Man Woman object
The program might need call sleep behavior object
Because sleep behavior behavior Human superclass group Man Woman object together treat Human object
There error
Please try
Thank signing

In computer science object composition way combine simple object data type complex one
Compositions building block many basic data structure including tagged union linked list
Consider relation automobile part specifically relation might fixed computer program composition relation
However real world relation softer fuzzier engine one automobile may replaced engine another automobile meaning relation better described aggregation composition
Generally speaking pass look like composition tend turn aggregation
Composition must distinguished subtyping process adding detail data type create specific data type
For instance car may type vehicle
Subtyping doesnt describe relationship different object instead say object type simultaneously object another type field given unique name one distinguished others
However reference doesnt necessarily mean object composite called composite object refers really part independent existence
For detail see section
In UML two way modelling composition Composition aggregation beware UML composition narrow meaning ordinary language Composition depicted filled diamond solid line
Composition kind association object sole responsibility disposition component part
The relationship composite component strong relationship object take ownership component
This mean composite responsible creation destruction component part object may part one composite
If composite object destroyed component part must destroyed part life transferred another object
Composition enforces encapsulation component part usually member composite object general form aggregation depicted unfilled diamond solid line
Aggregation kind association specifies relationship aggregate component part
This relationship aggregate component weak relationship component may survive aggregate object component object may accessed object without going aggregate object
If S subtype T subtyping relation often written S T mean term type S safely used context term type T expected
The precise semantics subtyping crucially depends particular safely used context mean programming language
The type system programming language defines subtyping relation
Due relation term may belong one type
Subtyping therefore form type polymorphism functional programming language often allow subtyping record
Consequently simply typed lambda calculus extended record type perhaps simplest theoretical setting useful notion subtyping may defined studied resulting calculus allows term one type longer simple type theory
Typically functional programming language provide usually restricted
In theoretical setting desirable study interaction two feature theoretical setting system F
Various calculus attempt capture property programming may derived system F
The concept subtyping related notion hyponymy holonymy
It also related concept bounded quantification mathematical logic number language subtyping called interface inheritance inheritance referred implementation inheritance
The notion subtyping programming language date back first formal treatment subtyping given John Reynolds used category theory formalize implicit conversion Luca Cardelli
The concept subtyping gained visibility adoption programming
A simple practical example subtypes shown diagram type bird three subtypes duck cuckoo ostrich
Conceptually variety bird inherits many bird characteristic specific difference
The UML notation used diagram arrow showing direction second case Integer Number Float Number Integer Float subtypes
Programmers may take advantage subtyping write code abstract manner would possible without
However possibility implementing operator highly constrains Number type
In programming class extensible creating object providing initial value state implementation behavior
In language class feature language class citizen
In language class creates class called metaclass time class implementation create object given type given implementation
In term theory class concrete data structure
Different class produce object type example
Similarly class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something nominalized example Banana type might represent property functionality banana general ABCBanana XYZBanana class would represent way producing banana
The ABCBanana class could produce particular banana instance ABCBanana class would object type Banana often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent class contains data field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object Python use associative container programming language support specification invariant part definition class enforce type system
Encapsulation state necessary able enforce invariant class behavior class instance defined using method
Methods subroutine ability operate object class operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class implement interface providing structure behavior structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation example abstract class define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result design client interface use method declared interface
In mathematics specifically graph theory directed graph graph set vertex connected edge edge direction associated
It differs ordinary undirected graph latter defined term unordered pair vertex specifically entity addressed directed multigraphs
On hand definition allows directed graph loop
More specifically directed graph without loop addressed directed graph
Symmetric directed graph directed graph edge bidirected simple directed graph directed graph loop multiple arrow source target node
As already introduced case arrow entity usually addressed directed multigraph
Some author describe digraph loop
Complete directed graph directed graph pair vertex joined symmetric pair directed arrow
It follows complete digraph symmetric oriented graph directed graph bidirected edge
It follows graph oriented graph iff hasnt
Tournaments oriented graph obtained choosing direction edge undirected complete graph
Directed acyclic graph directed graph directed cycle multitrees DAGs two directed path single starting vertex meet back ending vertex
Oriented tree polytrees DAGs formed orienting edge undirected acyclic graph rooted tree oriented tree edge underlying undirected tree directed away root
Rooted directed graph digraph vertex distinguished root control flow graph rooted digraph used computer science representation path might traversed program execution
graph directed graph node represent system variable branch represent functional connection pair node flow graph digraph associated set linear algebraic differential equation
State diagram directed multigraphs represent finite state machine representation quiver label vertex vector space edge compatibly linear transformation transform via natural transformation
If path lead x said successor x reachable x arrow called inverted arrow
The adjacency matrix graph unique identical permutation row
Another matrix representation graph incidence matrix
For vertex number head end adjacent vertex called indegree vertex indegree v denoted outdegree denoted
This principle OOP influential book Design Patterns
An implementation composition inheritance typically begin creation various interface representing behavior system must exhibit use interface allows technique support Polymorphic behavior valuable programming
Classes implementing identified interface built added business domain class needed thus system behavior realized without inheritance
In fact business domain class may base class without inheritance alternative implementation system behavior accomplished providing another class implement desired behavior interface
Any business domain class contains reference interface easily support implementation interface keep mind solves diamond problem multiple inheritance allowing virtual inheritance
The following C example demonstrates principle using inheritance interface achieve code reuse favor composition inheritance design principle give design higher flexibility
It natural build class component trying find commonality creating family tree
For example gas pedal wheel share common trait used benefit car easily defined
Composition also provides stable business domain long term le prone quirk family member
In word better compose object extend approach easily accommodates future requirement change would otherwise require complete restructuring class inheritance model
Additionally avoids problem often associated minor change model includes several generation class
Eric Raymond Unix programmer software advocate noted overuse inheritance lead thickly layered program destroy transparency favoring composition inheritance help preserve case
Some language notably Go use type composition exclusively contrast inheritance require base class method within derived class
Rather class need implement method different behavior base class method
This require significantly le programming effort class contains many method providing default behavior
For example code variable method Employee base class inherited HourlyEmployee SalariedEmployee derived subclass Pay method need implemented derived subclass
The method implemented class shared derived subclass
This drawback avoided using trait mixins protocol extension language Perl provide handle keyword facilitate method forwarding
In database design programming design composition relationship one object belongs another object behaves according rule ownership
In simple word relationship object called field object
Multiple relationship combine form possessive hierarchy contrasted relationship constitutes taxonomic hierarchy
The decision whether logical relationship object subordinate always clearly confusion decision necessitated creation metalinguistic term
A good example relationship container STL
In database relationship represented model
As see diagram right account multiple character show account relationship character
In programming relationship represented Unified Modeling Language Class diagram relationship also known composition
As see Class Diagram right car carburetor car composed carburetor
When diamond coloured black signifies composition object side closest diamond made contains object
While white diamond signifies aggregation mean object closest diamond posse object another way distinguish composition aggregation modeling real world consider relative lifetime contained object
For example Car object contains Chassis object lifetime car relationship one composition
On hand Car object contains set Tire object Car becomes unusable Tires may salvaged assigned another Car
At rate Tire object different lifetime Car object one make software Class implement relationship described Car object would contain complete Chassis object data member
On hand Car class data member point Tire object would likely pointer Tire object could instantiated deleted externally even assigned data member different Car object
Tire object would independent lifetime separate Car object deleted object composition Holonymy Meronymy Hypernymy Hyponymy

Programming language used program control behavior machine express algorithm
From early program used direct behavior Jacquard loom
Thousands different programming language created mainly computer field
Many programming language require computation specified imperative form language use form program specification declarative form
The description language usually split two component syntax semantics
Some language defined document language dominant implementation treated reference
Some language language defined standard extension taken dominant implementation common
A programming language notation writing program specification computation algorithm author restrict term programming language language express possible algorithm
For example PostScript program created another program control computer printer display
More generally language may describe computation possibly abstract
It generally accepted specification programming language includes description possibly idealized
In practical context programming language involves computer consequently abstraction Programming language usually contain abstraction defining manipulating data structure controlling flow execution
Expressive power The theory computation classifies language computation capable expressing Turing complete language implement set algorithm
Charity example language Turing complete markup language like XML HTML troff define structured data usually considered programming language

Some language support inheritance construct also example Eiffel contract define specification class also inherited heir
Design contract also known contract programming programming contract programming approach designing software
These specification referred contract accordance metaphor condition obligation business contract
The DbC approach assumes client component invoke operation component meet precondition specified required operation
Eiffel Software applied registration Design Contract December
The current owner trademark Eiffel Software Design contract root work formal verification formal specification Hoare logic
The client must pay fee entitled get product party must satisfy certain obligation law regulation applying contract
Guarantee certain property exit routine obligation supplier maintain certain property assumed entry guaranteed exit class invariant
The contract semantically equivalent Hoare triple formalises obligation summarised three question designer must repeatedly answer contract What contract expect
Many programming language facility make assertion like however DbC considers contract crucial software correctness part design process
In effect DbC advocate writing assertion first class relationship client class supplier class
A client class obliged make call supplier feature state supplier violated client call
Subsequently supplier obliged provide return state instance supplier data buffer may require data present buffer delete feature called
Subsequently guarantee client delete feature finish work
Other design contract concept class invariant class invariant guarantee state class maintained within specified tolerance end feature execution
When using contract supplier try verify condition satisfied
DbCs fail hard property simplifies debugging contract behavior behaviour routine clearly specified
This distinguishes markedly practice known defensive programming
DbC make job easier
C programming language encompassing strong typing imperative declarative functional generic programming discipline
It developed Microsoft within
NET initiative later approved standard Ecma C one programming language designed Common Language Infrastructure
C programming language development team led Anders Hejlsberg
The recent version C released along Visual Studio ECMA standard list design goal C The language intended simple modern programming language
Software robustness durability programmer productivity important language intended use developing software component suitable deployment distributed environment
Portability important source code programmer especially familiar Support internationalization important development
NET Framework class library originally written using managed code compiler system called Simple Managed In January Anders Hejlsberg formed team build new language time called Cool Microsoft considered keeping name Cool final name language chose trademark reason
Now C support boxing unboxing well similar feature Java
In July Anders Hejlsberg said C Java clone closer design
Since release C November one first major departure came addition generic language vastly different implementation
C make use reification provide generic object used class
These feature enable C programmer use functional programming technique closure C used mascot called Andy
It retired January C originally submitted ISO subcommittee JTC review withdrawn approved
The name C sharp inspired musical notation sharp indicates note made semitone higher pitch
This similar name indicates variable incremented
The sharp symbol also resembles ligature four symbol convention reflected C Language Specification
However practical Microsoft us intended musical symbol sharp suffix used number

A binary file computer file text file
The term binary file used term meaning file
Binary file usually thought sequence byte binary file typically contain byte intended interpreted something text character
Compiled computer program example indeed compiled application sometimes referred particularly programmer
But binary file also mean contain image sound compressed version file etc
short
Some binary file contain header block metadata used program interpret data file
The header often contains signature magic number identify format example GIF file contain multiple image header used identify describe block image data
The leading byte header would contain text like identify binary GIF file binary file contain header may called flat binary file
To send binary file certain system allow data value encoding data disadvantage increasing file size transfer well requiring translation back binary receipt
See encoding subject hex editor viewer may used view file data sequence hexadecimal value corresponding byte binary file
If binary file opened editor group eight bit typically translated single character
Other type viewer simply replace character space revealing text
This type view useful inspection binary file order find password game find hidden text file
It even used inspect suspicious file unwanted effect example user would see suspected software may attempt connect order upload unapproved data
If file treated executable run standard important binary file
For example binary file interpreted ASCII character set result text displayed custom application interpret file differently byte may sound pixel even entire word
Binary meaningless time executed algorithm defines done bit byte thus examining binary attempting match known format lead wrong conclusion actually represents
This fact used steganography algorithm interprets binary data file differently reveal hidden content without algorithm impossible tell hidden content exists
In computing source code collection computer instruction possibly comment written using programming language usually ordinary text
The source code program designed facilitate work computer programmer
The source code often transformed assembler compiler binary machine code understood computer machine code might stored execution later time
Alternatively source code may interpreted thus immediately executed application software distributed form includes executable file
If source code included would useful user programmer system administrator Linux Information Project defines source code Source code version software originally written human plain text
The notion source code may also broadly include machine code notation graphical language
It therefore construed include code high level language
Often several step program translation minification source code typed human executable program
The earliest program computer entered binary front panel switch computer programming language distinction source code machine code
When IBM first offered software work machine code provided additional charge
At time cost developing supporting software included price hardware decade IBM distributed source code software product license
Most early computer magazine published source code program Source code also stored database elsewhere
The source code piece software may contained single file many file
Though practice uncommon source code written different programming language
For example program written primarily C programming language language Java done run time
The code base programming project larger collection source code computer program make project
It become practice maintain code base version control system
Moderately complex software customarily requires compilation assembly several sometimes dozen even hundred case instruction compilation Makefile included source code
If S subtype T subtyping relation often written S T mean term type S safely used context term type T expected
The precise semantics subtyping crucially depends particular safely used context mean programming language
The type system programming language defines subtyping relation
Due relation term may belong one type
Subtyping therefore form type polymorphism functional programming language often allow subtyping record
Consequently simply typed lambda calculus extended record type perhaps simplest theoretical setting useful notion subtyping may defined studied resulting calculus allows term one type longer simple type theory
Typically functional programming language provide usually restricted
In theoretical setting desirable study interaction two feature theoretical setting system F

Java computer programming language concurrent specifically designed implementation dependency possible
It intended let application developer write run anywhere Java application typically compiled bytecode run Java virtual machine regardless computer architecture
As Java one popular programming language use particularly web application Java originally developed James Gosling Sun Microsystems released core component Sun Microsystems Java platform
The language derives much syntax C original reference implementation Java compiler virtual machine class library originally released Sun proprietary licence
As May compliance specification Java Community Process others also developed alternative implementation Sun technology GNU Compiler Java GNU Classpath
James Gosling Mike Sheridan Patrick Naughton initiated Java language project June Java originally designed interactive television advanced digital cable television industry time
The language initially called Oak oak tree stood outside Goslings office later project went name Green finally renamed Java Java coffee
Gosling designed Java syntax system application programmer would find familiar Sun Microsystems released first public implementation Java
It promised Write Once Run Anywhere providing popular platform fairly secure featuring configurable security allowed restriction
Major web browser soon incorporated ability run Java applet within web page Java quickly became popular mostly outside browser January Oracle announced Java runtime environment based discontinue browser plugin
The Java compiler Java Arthur van Hoff comply strictly Java language specification advent Java new version multiple configuration built different type platform
included technology APIs enterprise application typically run server environment desktop version renamed
In marketing purpose Sun renamed new version Java EE Java ME Sun Microsystems approached standard body later Ecma International formalize Java soon withdrew process
Java remains de facto standard controlled Java Community Process one time Sun made Java implementation available without charge despite proprietary software status
Sun generated revenue Java selling license specialized product Java Enterprise System November Sun released much Java virtual machine free software term GNU General Public License
Suns Rich Green said Suns ideal role regard Java evangelist prevent Oracle filing lawsuit Google shortly using Java inside Android SDK
Java software run everything laptop data center game console scientific supercomputer April James Gosling resigned Oracle
There five primary goal creation Java language It must simple must robust secure
In programming language virtual function virtual method inheritable overridable function method dynamic dispatch facilitated
This concept important part portion programming
If virtual method resolved early Virtual function allow program call method dont necessarily even exist moment code compiled
In virtual method declared prepending virtual keyword declaration base class
This modifier inherited implementation method derived class meaning continue
And even method owned base class call virtual method example base class Animal could virtual function eat
Subclass Llama would implement eat differently subclass Wolf one eat class instance referred Animal
A pure virtual function pure virtual method function required implemented derived class derived class abstract
Classes containing pure virtual method termed abstract instantiated directly subclass abstract class instantiated directly inherited pure virtual method implemented class parent class
Pure virtual method typically declaration definition example abstract base class MathSymbol may provide pure virtual function doOperation derived class Plus Minus implement doOperation provide concrete implementation
Implementing doOperation would make sense MathSymbol class MathSymbol concept whose behaviour defined solely given kind MathSymbol
Similarly subclass MathSymbol would complete without implementation doOperation
Pure virtual function also used method declaration used define interface similar interface keyword Java explicitly specifies use derived class supply implementation
In pattern abstract class serf interface contain pure virtual function
In using purely abstract class interface work support multiple inheritance however many OOP language support multiple inheritance often provide separate interface mechanism
An example Java programming language language differ behaviour constructor destructor object running
For language notably virtual dispatching mechanism different semantics construction destruction object language typically manage memory allocation automatically object created destroyed
However language allow custom destructor method implemented language question us automatic memory management custom destructor called certain appropriate one object question
Such inherited class called subclass parent class super class
It mechanism code reuse independent extension original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise hierarchy inheritance invented Simula
Inheritance confused subtyping distinguish concept subtyping also known interface inheritance whereas inheritance defined known implementation inheritance code inheritance
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship inheritance contrasted object composition one object contains another object see composition inheritance
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language single inheritance subclass inherit feature one superclass
A class acquires property another class multiple inheritance one class one superclass inherit feature parent class
Multilevel inheritance subclass inherited another subclass uncommon class derived another derived class shown figure Multilevel inheritance
The class A serf class derived class B
The class B known intermediate base class provides link inheritance A C chain ABC known inheritance path
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level hierarchical inheritance one class serf superclass one sub class
Hybrid inheritance mix two type inheritance
A Subclass derived class heir class child class modular semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits instance variable member function superclass
The general form defining class The colon indicates derived
The optional present may private public
Visibility mode specifies whether feature class privately derived publicly derived
Some language support inheritance construct also example Eiffel contract define specification class also inherited heir
In mathematics square number perfect square integer square integer word product integer
For number since written
The usual notation square n product n The name square number come name shape another way saying integer square number square root integer
For example square number positive integer perfect square divisor except called
For integer n nth square number concept square extended number system
If rational number included square ratio two integer conversely ratio two square integer square
Starting square number including square smaller The difference perfect square predecessor given identity
Equivalently possible count square number adding together last square last square root current root The number number one compose square equal square
Hence square side length n area expression nth square number
This also equal sum first n odd number seen picture formula follows n k So several recursive method computing square number
For example nth square number computed square n
Alternatively nth square number calculated two doubling th square subtracting th square number adding
For example square number also sum two consecutive triangular number
The sum two square number centered square number
Every odd square also octagonal number
In arithmetic algebra cube number n third power result number multiplied twice n n It also number multiplied square n also volume formula geometric cube side length n giving rise name
The inverse operation finding number whose cube n called extracting cube root n determines side cube given volume
It also n raised power cube cube root odd
The cube number mathematical expression denoted superscript cube number perfect cube sometimes cube number cube integer
The perfect cube Geometrically speaking integer perfect cube one arrange solid unit cube larger
For small cube arranged one larger one appearance Rubiks Cube difference cube consecutive integer expressed follows
There minimum perfect cube since cube integer negative
For example unlike perfect square perfect cube small number possibility last two digit
Except cube divisible last two digit pair digit last digit odd perfect cube
With even cube considerable restriction cube number also square number square number cube number
This happens number perfect sixth power last digit power It however easy show number perfect cube perfect cube must digital root
That value modulo may every positive integer written sum nine positive cube
The equation solution integer
In fact none Eisenstein integer statement also true equation
The sum first n cube nth triangle number n
Proofs Charles Wheatstone give simple derivation expanding cube sum set consecutive odd number
Indeed begin giving identity n n consecutive odd number kanim provides purely visual proof Benjamin Orrison provide two additional proof Nelsen give seven geometric proof
It distinct single inheritance object class may inherit one particular object class
This addressed various way including using virtual inheritance alternate method object composition based inheritance mixins trait also proposed address ambiguity
In programming inheritance describes relationship two class one class subclass parent class
The child inherits method attribute parent allowing shared functionality
Languages support multiple inheritance include Common Lisp EuLisp Curl Dylan Eiffel Logtalk Object REXX Scala OCaml Perl Perl Python Tcl
IBM System Object Model runtime support multiple inheritance programming language targeting SOM implement new SOM class inherited multiple base
Some language C Java Ruby implement single inheritance although protocol interface PHP us trait class inherit specific method implementation
Ruby us module inherit multiple method diamond problem ambiguity arises two class B C inherit A class D inherits B If method A B C overridden D override version method D inherit B For example context GUI software development class Button may inherit class Rectangle Clickable class Rectangle Clickable inherit Object class
It called problem shape class inheritance diagram situation
In case class A top B C separately beneath D join two together bottom form diamond shape language different way dealing problem repeated inheritance
default follows inheritance path separately D object would contain two separate A object us As member properly qualified
If inheritance A B inheritance A C marked virtual take special care create one A object us As member work correctly
If virtual inheritance nonvirtual inheritance mixed single virtual A requires stating explicitly parent class feature used invoked Worker Human
Age
support explicit repeated inheritance since would way qualify superclass use also allows single instance multiple class created via virtual inheritance mechanism
Common Lisp CLOS attempt provide reasonable default behavior ability override default put simply method sorted D B C A B written C class definition
The method specific argument class chosen order parent class named subclass definition however programmer override giving specific method resolution order stating rule combining method
The decorator pattern often useful adhering Single Responsibility Principle allows functionality divided class unique area concern
This achieved designing new Decorator class wrap original class pattern designed multiple decorator stacked top time adding new functionality overridden method
Note decorator class object share common set feature
In previous diagram method available decorated undecorated version
The decoration feature defined interface mixin class inheritance shared decorator
In previous example class Component inherited ConcreteComponent subclass descend Decorator decorator pattern alternative subclassing
Subclassing add behavior compile time change affect instance original class difference becomes important several independent way extending functionality
In programming language class created runtime would mean new class would made every possible combination
By contrast decorator object created runtime Streams implementation Java
NET Framework incorporate decorator pattern
As example consider window windowing system allow scrolling window content one may wish add horizontal vertical scrollbars appropriate
Assume window represented instance Window class one could create subclass ScrollingWindow provides create ScrollingWindowDecorator add functionality existing Window object
At point either solution would fine assume one also desire ability add border window
Again original Window class support ScrollingWindow subclass pose problem effectively created new kind window
If one wish add support many window
This problem get worse every new feature window subtype added notice functionality need added Windows could modify base class
On hand sometimes possible legal decorator make possible add alter behavior interface
Two option presented first dynamic decorator following Java example illustrates use decorator using scenario
The following class contain decorator Window class including class
This principle OOP influential book Design Patterns
An implementation composition inheritance typically begin creation various interface representing behavior system must exhibit use interface allows technique support Polymorphic behavior valuable programming
Classes implementing identified interface built added business domain class needed thus system behavior realized without inheritance
In fact business domain class may base class without inheritance alternative implementation system behavior accomplished providing another class implement desired behavior interface
Any business domain class contains reference interface easily support implementation interface keep mind solves diamond problem multiple inheritance allowing virtual inheritance
The following C example demonstrates principle using inheritance interface achieve code reuse favor composition inheritance design principle give design higher flexibility
It natural build class component trying find commonality creating family tree
For example gas pedal wheel share common trait used benefit car easily defined
Composition also provides stable business domain long term le prone quirk family member
In word better compose object extend approach easily accommodates future requirement change would otherwise require complete restructuring class inheritance model
Additionally avoids problem often associated minor change model includes several generation class
Eric Raymond Unix programmer software advocate noted overuse inheritance lead thickly layered program destroy transparency favoring composition inheritance help preserve case
Some language notably Go use type composition exclusively contrast inheritance require base class method within derived class
Rather class need implement method different behavior base class method
This require significantly le programming effort class contains many method providing default behavior
For example code variable method Employee base class inherited HourlyEmployee SalariedEmployee derived subclass Pay method need implemented derived subclass
The method implemented class shared derived subclass
This drawback avoided using trait mixins protocol extension language Perl provide handle keyword facilitate method forwarding
Design Patterns Elements Reusable Software software engineering book describing software design pattern
The book author Erich Gamma Richard Helm Ralph Johnson book includes example Smalltalk
It influential field engineering regarded important source design theory
More copy sold English
The author often referred Gang Four book started bird feather session Towards Architecture Handbook run Bruce Anderson Erich Gamma Richard Helm met discovered common interest
They later joined Ralph Johnson John Vlissides original publication date book October copyright hence often cited despite published
The book first made available public OOPSLA meeting held Portland Oregon ACM SIGPLAN awarded year Programming Languages Achievement Award author recognition impact work programming practice programming language design
As March book printing Composition inheritance Favor object composition class inheritance
The author refer inheritance reuse referring visibility contrast author refer object composition reuse internal detail composed object need visible code using
The author discus tension inheritance encapsulation length state experience designer overuse inheritance danger stated follows Because inheritance expose subclass detail parent implementation often said inheritance break encapsulation
They warn implementation subclass become bound implementation parent class change implementation force subclass change
Furthermore claim way avoid inherit abstract using inheritance recommended mainly adding functionality existing component reusing old code adding relatively small amount new code
To author delegation form object composition always used replace inheritance
Delegation involves two object sender pass delegate let delegate refer sender thus link two part system established runtime
The Callback article information delegation
The author also discus parameterized type known generic template
These allow type defined without specifying type unspecified type supplied parameter point use
The author admit delegation parameterization powerful add warning Dynamic highly parameterized software harder understand build static software
Coupling usually contrasted cohesion
Low coupling often correlate high cohesion vice versa low coupling often sign computer system good design combined high cohesion support general goal high readability maintainability
Structured Design including cohesion coupling published article Stevens Myers Constantine book Yourdon Constantine coupling low high
Content coupling Content coupling occurs one module modifies relies working another module
In situation change way second module produce data might also require change dependent module Common coupling Common coupling occurs two module share global data
Changing shared resource might imply changing module using External coupling External coupling occurs two module share externally imposed data format communication protocol device interface
This basically related communication external tool device Control coupling Control coupling one module controlling flow another passing information
Stamp coupling Stamp coupling occurs module share data structure use part
In situation modification field module need may lead changing way module read record Data coupling Data coupling occurs module share data example parameter
Each datum piece data shared
Message coupling This loosest type coupling achieved state decentralization component communication done via parameter message passing
No coupling Modules communicate one another subclass coupling Describes relationship child parent
The child connected parent parent connected child temporal coupling When two action bundled together one module happen occur time
In recent work various coupling concept investigated used indicator different modularization principle used practice assembly module might require effort time due increased dependency
A particular module might harder reuse test dependent module must included longer message require CPU memory produce
To optimize runtime performance message length must minimized message meaning must maximized Message Transmission Overhead Performance Since message must transmitted full retain complete meaning message transmission must optimized
Longer message require CPU memory transmit receive also necessary receiver must reassemble message original state completely receive
Hence optimize performance message length must minimized

As possible often encouraged override inherited method provide meaningful implementation
The exact method invoke original overriding version determined class receiver message runtime
It still possible invoke original method sending call super
This demonstrated overriding method inherited NSObject
To demonstrate add following code This method little except call NSObject method Fraction called We also setting ivars zero
method related memory management basically involves releasing memory held object
Because contain object ivars actually anything release
We use skeletal implementation simply call turn call NSObject
Because MixedNumber inherits Fraction whatever get released Fraction also released MixedNumber
As matter fact forget include method get compiler warning
A later lesson focus allow add method class including class access code Apple Foundation UIKit class
Note possible override ivars however MixedNumber show quite easy add new ivar
In addition ivars well almost ivar although rarely used superclass declares directly accessible subclass
There one pitfall involving inherited ivars pointer
If direct assign former simply pointer assuming object superclass ivar mean get freed changed superclass happen subclass
The solution assuming undesired usually declare one parameter header file class
Note applied property object remember primitive type passed pointer anyway issue exist
There exist create class designed used merely object subclassed
For example almost never create use subclass
NSObject therefore abstract class
A variant Foudation fact behind scene number subclass hold different type number
You interact subclass
These class along class cluster
http An object inherits various instance variable method superclass
However fundamental principle inheritance also allow extend superclass well override inherited method replacing different implementation
To illustrate example subclass Fraction class MixedNumber class
Let get started
Mixed Number How would implement mixed number
At initial glance look pretty
A mixed number simply represented integer main number component Fraction object fractional component fact class us another class part data storage known
But good part inheritance instance variable inherits Fraction simply use
Therefore new ivar need add integer numerical portion
In Xcode open FractionDemo project
Click File New In left click Cocoa Class choose Class make sure subclass NSObject click Next
Save File Name make sure check box Also create checked
Click Finish
This take file listing Xcode open text editor
Import make subclass Fraction
Rather providing full listing try figure code
If stuck download full code end post
Add portion synthesize
In add following method implementation Make sure add method declaration header
A thing note Note subclass call one direct superclass overridden method using keyword This work much way keyword except latter refers current instance former refers superclass
A test routine MixedNumber class The code rather make sure understand method called method actually found inheritance chain especially start override method
The output You download latest FractionDemo code
http Inheritance central tenet programming
In nutshell refers creation new class extending existing class feature
In interface file following line The part bold indicates class Apple provides
Nearly every class create interact inherited NSObject directly indirectly
A top inheritance hierarchy
Almost Cocoa Touch Foundation class inherit NSObject
Incidentally NSObject also called designed actually ever use NSObject usually create use subclass
An abstract class therefore one created purpose subclassing
A class inherits another known
Every subclass inherits certain property superclass exactly inherited controlled
By default every class access instance variable superclass work exactly defined ivars subclass
In addition subclass inherit public method superclass defines
As example kept one file brevity Output The inheritance chain As see created instance object type
We used class
Notice however called Subclass accessed ivar neither declared Subclass
This already present Superclass Subclass inherited
The output prof Subclass able access inherited variable
method simply declaration class invoked runtime chosen How program figure method call especially one method name inheritance chain
In fact procedure simple
The runtime environment search explicit declaration method class object sent message example search begin Subclass class
If found class invokes method word invokes version closest class inheritance chain
If found look method superclass found invokes version search continues either method found
In latter case get compiler warning class may respond specific method
When code try call method execution program likely crash

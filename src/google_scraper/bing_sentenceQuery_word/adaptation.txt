The term refers adapts behaviour individual user based acquired user environment
A pass potentially long cycle delivery realize component system
However impossible anticipate user single best optimal system configuration impossible
The active involvement user clear understanding user requirement challenge interactive system two reason With norm give guidance activity throughout life cycle interactive system
One core task design negotiate facilitate across acknowledging different form expression different requirement side
However despite implementation design process type modern application require instant adaptation due exposure increasing situational dynamic
Even design process implemented project guarantee certain degree yield richer understanding context use completed product ability adapt changing condition still play central role broad acceptance
The operational environment change task distinct competence expectation evolve
Here impossible developer anticipate possible requirement modification
Thus dynamic changing condition shift customisation process system characteristic development phase usage operation phase time needed professional development short new feature costly
For reason developer implement technique adaptation system order react changing condition fast possible
The example application scenario clearly show important distinction concerning adaptation technique differentiation manually automatically performed adaptation process
Accordingly term adaptation decomposes two term adaptivity
Adaptivity indicates system adapts automatically user according changing condition

Adaptability refers user substantially customise system tailoring activity
adaptable system
Adaptive adaptable system complementary
Both method increase match user need system behaviour development system finished
Thus system kept flexible usage
Changing condition trigger execution adaptation
Many characteristic might taken account adaptation process
They clustered three main category environmental difference
Differences address variety among several user along manifold dimension
Physiological characteristic like disability major concern application designer want system accepted large community
The consideration user like scheme interaction option property numberless personal preference popular source adaptation reused different application
Other source user interest disinterest personality characteristic like difficult ass automatically
difference consider development single user well task time
A static system fall short changing user requirement user activity goal evolve
In extreme case user system beginning perceive system cumbersome restricted user increase
In manner need higher computer system pushed changing task accomplished system
Environmental Differences basically result computing device application people lead highly dynamic computing environment
Unlike rely carefully configured largely static set resource application subject change available resource network connectivity device
Moreover frequently required cooperate spontaneously opportunistically previously unknown software service order accomplish task behalf user
Thus environment surrounding application user major source justify adaptation operation

An adaptation physical behavioral characteristic developed allow organism better survive environment
Adaptations result evolution may occur gene mutates change accident
That mutation cause organism better survive reproduce pass trait offspring
It take many generation develop adaptation
One physical adaptation used crab hard shell protects predator drying crushed wave
A behavioral adaptation ocean use loud call fin whale communicate whale great distance
Other physical adaptation may include webbed foot sharp claw large beak
Other change made part body could feather fur scale
Behavioral adaptation include animal action typically response external
Several may include animal capable eating move way protect
Take behavioral adaptation
Squirrels woodchuck chipmunk able hibernate month often consuming plenty food preparation winter
In scenario small animal found way evolve season protect harsh weather condition preserving food environment
The ability adapt throughout planet part many diverse animal existing today land sea sky
Animals protect predator adapt new environment adaptation mutation unlike human being
For example animal camouflaged often coloration pattern assist blending surroundings benefit long run quite literally come predator
Mutations may also take place change DNA
What living mammal born may change grows time
Through possibility animal larger opportunity survive dangerous environment continue circle life offspring

In nascent Santa Fe Institute sponsored two workshop Emerging Syntheses Science Institute founder brainstormed plan future
At time I beginning graduate student computer science never heard SFI reading workshop proceeding year later I excited Institute goal pursue research large number highly complex interactive system properly studied interdisciplinary The founder planned define particular theme program would benefit kind intensive interaction offered new institute
SFI first official program formed Economics
Before long several influential player field took note SFI novel interdisciplinary approach economics program grew quickly fact threatening take fledgling organization
Founder first SFI President George Cowan wanted make sure economics come dominate
He wrote We start somewhere also make sure beginning economics become one interest pushed hard support least one program would equal size economics program
We needed broaden academic agenda spread Cowan push start program adaptive Adaptive computation broad area cover three major thread computing context complex adaptive system In science computer traditionally used perform numerical simulation using mathematical equation simulate behavior physical system turbulence fluid missile trajectory space
But system interest SFI economics social system prime example hard impossible find set equation describes evolving system
Instead study complex system pioneered computational simulation behavior individual system component agent interaction explicitly simulated rather simulating behavior equation describing system whole
simulation become mainstay research complex system ranging gene network financial market
Computers made adaptive lifelike adopting idea natural adaptive system
This idea go back beginning computer age trailblazer Alan Turing John von Neumann thinking hard connection programmable computer living system
Since time theory brain inspired computational neural network learn theory Darwinian evolution inspired genetic algorithm program evolve via computational natural selection rather engineered human immunology inspired artificial immune system computer fight computer virus malware
Other inspiration new computing method come natural adaptive system diverse ant colony slime mold economic market social network
The idea computation go beyond traditionally call As former SFI scientist Chris Langton eloquently put The proper domain computer science information processing writ large across A key property complex adaptive system ability process information compute order adapt thrive environment
Thus concept theory computer science adapted provide scientific language understanding information processing natural world
SFI Adaptive Computation AC program originated work John Holland University Michigan
Holland developed theory adaptation well computer model evolution learning
Genetic algorithm method evolving program computer structure Holland invention classifier system evolving learning system Echo model model evolving ecosystem
Holland originally recruited SFI first resident faculty member lead AC program
However much thought decided stay Michigan albeit frequent visit SFI continued year
John Miller Holland collaborator SFI first postdoc took direction program organized founding workshop brought together many leading thinker area related adaptive computation
Miller however soon leaving faculty position Carnegie Mellon University another director found
I come University Michigan work artificial intelligence AI Douglas Hofstadter
During first year I took John Holland course Adaptation Natural Artificial I enchanted beautiful theory developed Holland amazed ability genetic algorithm evolve sophisticated program design
My focus still AI work Hofstadter I made time work Holland student particularly Stephanie Forrest genetic algorithm
Holland became
After graduating I offered postdoctoral fellowship Michigan Society Fellows work primarily Holland genetic algorithm
In early Holland asked I might want come SFI next academic year direct AC program
I jumped chance
For young postdoc opportunity lifetime I somehow managed stretch single year visitor six year resident professor SFI
Over six year existence AC program resident visiting researcher made significant impact three thread described
Here I summarize prominent example result program SFI AC program promoted sustained collaboration computer scientist evolutionary biologist building model biological evolution different scale
In addition scientist program built extensively Holland work genetic algorithm classifier system thought energy flow ecology formalized Echo model developed Holland Terry Jones Stephanie Forrest
Stephanie Forrest Alan Perelson pioneered work modeling adaptive immune system
AC program researcher also collaborated economist creating model economic market agent like decision maker economy limited rationality knowledge able adapt learn
This notion adaptive economic agent become central aspect called complexity economics
Finally AC program included several visitor worked model human animal learning interaction learning evolution
These modeling effort variously based genetic algorithm classifier system neural network dynamical system
A example program research included development computational immune system used immunological principle recognize computer virus network attack set defense use genetic algorithm automatically evolve computational structure computer program neural network cellular automaton implementation swarm intelligence using principle insect colony simulation order improve performance learning program host data learn parasite

The example research I described many others put SFI map key player adaptive computation
In addition many publication written invited lecture given program member one particularly impressive honor
In five year AC program founding polled large group researcher answer question If first Nobel Prize Information Technology triggering invitation lab choice one would pick Once vote counted published list included Stanford Berkeley MIT Bell Labs Microsoft similar institution
Of tiny SFI tied
And question restricted lab focusing biologically inspired computation SFI moved first place
SFI small size limited resource mean prosper intellectually must keep bringing new idea new Thus Institute tenure permanent faculty position
It also permanent program
In SFI faculty term coming end I left Institute academic job Oregon
The Adaptive Computation program also came end Economics program
More generally whole idea official broad program Institute restructured notion interdisciplinary research theme
However spirit adaptive computation remains strong SFI many people incorporate AC research topic ranging model ancient state formation genetic algorithm automatically finding software bug
Furthermore idea adaptive computation spread far wide university computer science curriculum many department
Indeed program result impressed computer scientist people many area science
Perhaps favorite example famously skeptical evolutionary theorist Richard Lewontin hearing SFI Adaptive Computation research announced I believe adaptation
But I sure heck believe computation Whether adaptation computation I proud part birth development foundational program understanding complex adaptive system

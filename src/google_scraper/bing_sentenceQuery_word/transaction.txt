information processing divided individual indivisible operation called
Each transaction must succeed complete unit never partially complete
For example purchase book online bookstore exchange money form credit book
If credit good series related operation ensures get book bookstore get money
However single operation series fails exchange entire exchange fails
You get book bookstore get money
The technology responsible making exchange balanced predictable called transaction processing
Transactions ensure resource permanently updated unless operation within transactional unit complete successfully
By combining set related operation unit either completely succeeds completely fails one simplify error recovery make one application reliable
Transaction processing system consist computer hardware software hosting application performs routine transaction necessary conduct business
Examples include system manage sale order entry airline reservation payroll employee record manufacturing shipping
Since though necessarily transaction processing today interactive term often treated synonymous
Transaction processing designed maintain system Integrity typically modern known consistent state ensuring interdependent operation system either completed successfully canceled successfully
For example consider typical banking transaction involves moving customer saving account customer checking account
This transaction involves least two separate operation computer term debiting saving account crediting checking account
If one operation succeeds book bank balance end day
There must therefore way ensure either operation succeed fail never inconsistency bank database whole
Transaction processing link multiple individual operation single indivisible transaction ensures either operation transaction completed without error none
If operation completed error occur others attempted system roll back operation transaction including successful one thereby erasing trace transaction restoring system consistent known state processing transaction began
If operation transaction completed successfully transaction system change database made permanent transaction rolled back done
Transaction processing guard hardware software error might leave transaction partially completed
If computer system crash middle transaction transaction processing system guarantee operation uncommitted transaction cancelled
Generally transaction issued concurrently
If overlap
need touch portion database create conflict
For example customer mentioned example saving account attempt transfer different person time moving checking account one succeed
However forcing transaction processed sequentially inefficient
Therefore concurrent implementation transaction processing programmed guarantee end result reflects outcome could reached executing transaction sequentially order property called
In example mean matter transaction issued first either transfer different person move checking account succeeds one fails
The basic principle system
However terminology may vary one system another term used necessarily universal
system ensure database integrity recording intermediate state database modified using record restore database known state transaction committed
For example copy information database modification transaction set aside system transaction make modification sometimes called
If part transaction fails committed copy used restore database state transaction began
It also possible keep separate modification database management system
sometimes called
This required rollback failed transaction useful updating database management system event database failure system provide
If database management system fails entirely must restored recent
The reflect transaction committed since made
However database management system restored journal image applied database bring database management system date
Any transaction progress time failure rolled back
The result database consistent known state includes result transaction committed moment failure
In case two transaction may course processing attempt access portion database time way prevents proceeding
For example transaction A may access portion X database transaction B may access portion Y database
If point transaction A try access portion Y database transaction B try access portion X occurs neither transaction move forward
system designed detect deadlock occur
Typically transaction cancelled rolled back started different order automatically deadlock occur
Or sometimes one deadlocked transaction cancelled rolled back automatically restarted short delay
Deadlocks also occur among three transaction
The transaction involved difficult detect point transaction processing system find practical limit deadlock detect
In system commit rollback mechanism available undesirable often used undo failed transaction restore system previous state
defined property reliable transaction system late acronym atomicity consistency isolation durability
A transaction change state atomic either happen none happen
These change include database change message action transducer
A transaction correct transformation state
The action taken group violate integrity constraint associated state
Even though transaction execute concurrently appears transaction T others executed either T T
Once transaction completes successfully commits change database survive failure retain change Transaction processing benefit Standard first developed often closely coupled particular
implemented similar principle mixed success
However recent year distributed model become considerably difficult maintain
As number transaction grew response various online service especially single distributed database practical solution
In addition online system consist whole suite program operating together opposed strict model single server could handle transaction processing
Today number transaction processing system available work level scale large system including
One effort DTP see also JTA
However proprietary environment IBM still popular although CICS evolved include open industry standard well
The term used describe transaction processing system uncommonly challenging requirement particularly throughput requirement transaction per second
Such system may implemented via distributed cluster style architecture

Can someone provide straightforward simpler possible explanation transaction applied computing even copied Wikipedia
A transaction unit work want treat whole
It either happen full
A classical example transferring money one bank account another
To first withdraw amount source account deposit destination account
The operation succeed full
If stop halfway money lost Very Bad
In modern database transaction also thing like ensure ca access data another person written halfway
But basic idea transaction ensure
They guarantee NOT situation money withdrawn one account deposited another
A transaction way representing state change
Transactions ideally four property commonly known ACID See Wikipedia entry detail
Although typically applied database
In particular see
A series data manipulation statement must either fully complete fully fail leaving database consistent state Here simple explanation
You need transfer buck account A account B
You either If something go wrong first second operation pair problem either buck disappeared appeared nowhere
A transaction mechanism allows mark group operation execute way either execute commit system state started execute rollback
either transfer buck leave account initial state
A transaction sequence one SQL operation treated unit
Specifically transaction appears run isolation furthermore system fails transaction either executed entirety
The concept transaction motivated two completely independent concern
One concurrent access database multiple client system resilient system failure
Transaction support known ACID property Properties Transactions Transactions following four standard property usually referred acronym ACID Transaction Control There following command used control transaction ACID tomicity onsistency solation urability When wish multiple transactional resource involved single transaction need use something like solution
quite widely supported
I would suggest definition processing would useful cover transaction concept computer science
From wikipedia In computer science transaction processing information processing divided individual indivisible operation called transaction
Each transaction must succeed fail complete unit remain intermediate state
In addition response noted least theory restriction whatsoever kind resource involved transaction
Most time database multiple distinct database also conceivable printer take part transaction cause transaction fail say event paper jam
I think transaction atomic action term DBMS
mean seperated
yes transction may several instruction system execute
binded together finished single basic task
example
need walk bridge let treat transction say need step
overall step seperated
done half two choice continue finish go back start point
like result transaction success committed fail rollback Transaction indivisible unit data processing transaction must ACID property ie Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durable Transaction nothing intermidiate mean transfer money one account another account one account lose much one gain amount transfer money one account another account still empty transaction Transaction defined collection task considered minimum processing unit
Each minimum processing unit divided
The main operation transaction read write
All transaction must contain four property commonly known ACID property purpose ensuring accuracy completeness data integrity

Advantages Disadvantages Analysis Applications Spreadsheets Database Word Processing Email Conclusion The Paperless society
Introduction Paperless Society Conclusion Appendices Bibliography References Computer Solutions Introduction The following report look three main area first area demonstrate understanding regarding advantage disadvantage Transaction Processing
The second section look advantage disadvantage business context discussing application Spreadsheets Database Word processing would best used expand strength weakness area
The finally part three research provide evidence regarding society live today achieved Society
It discus look toward providing evidence backup discredit hypothesis method using different form research
Transaction Processing What transaction processing
Transaction processing involves round trip transfer financial transaction data example consumer credit card information merchant web site processing network VeriSign thereafter completes transfer fund merchant
From quotation established processing electronic form processing data
This format financial transaction simply processing order via electronic format purchase via Web
Advantages The advantage system ease quickness used
For example automated transaction process ATM machine whole wall banking
Through service customer able withdraw deposit money check account detail order stationary cheque book statement etc
This available time convenient customer accessible hour day meaning customer conduct Middle Other facility also available within package mail merge
This benefit company data merged program order produce thing mailing label envelope standard form letter etc
The advantage time saved repetitive job quick easy relatively error free
Large volume letter etc produced short time
Through inclusion spelling grammar check facility document checked error quickly make work dispatched company become professional
The find replace function able locate specified would within document replace another required
This save time go multi paged document reading word word order find error change
The program automatically change word second check user word located fact want changing
There many feature within program make viable business older form typing ability change font style size address appearance new version Microsoft Word used effective desk top publishing package
The main disadvantage computer shuts program performs illegal operation work saved document could lost
Another disadvantage word processing program compatible would mean work produced specific software would edited one compatible version
Training cost could also become expensive order staff able operate specific processing package retraining new version word Conclusion Paper consumption increase around world especially developing Asian country
World consumption metric ton according FAO Food Agriculture Organisation United Nations
The second annual National Filing Survey found per cent respondent believe paperless office unachievable even working towards believe either
Conclusion Although fact lead u believe reaching goal society documented evidence case found
On research carried seam disprove hypothesis Paperless society
From finding seen evidence show paper used today previously possible different format
reduced preparation time cost sending correspondence evidence show recipient still print lot information
This could fully trusting technology yet even finding easier read hard copy format one fully know sure research concluded done study Richard Harper Abigail Sellen
Therefore research concluded still long way society possible never one
When I hear term paperless office I control laughter
Why
Because thing paperless office
And unfortunately likely become reality anytime soon
Scott Nesbitt latest technology allow u work digital world depend paper heavily
Indeed workplace dependent paper
It seems promised paperless office much mythical ideal today thirty year ago

In Section Transaction Histories A H set transaction consists two part event E reflects operation read write abort commit transaction version order committed object version
The author give comment partial order event Page For convenience present history event example consistent partial order
Furthermore wherever possible example make total order consistent event database system
Why present partial order event total order
Because partial order may imply multiple total order consistent one choose
Does choice matter later definition theorem
Some comment total version order Page follows The version order history H different order write commit event H
This flexibility needed allow certain optimistic implementation possible version placed version version order even though installed committed state installed
And The system chooses version order object
What mean database system choose version order
And
Is
concern Question theoretical result state partial order S extended total order S contains S
This result known Order Extension Principle proof result us Axiom Choice I aware whether alternative proof use
The paper written French find proof
When Adya state chooses order event best guess assumes implementation database case every history H corresponds execution database event totally ordered order order
More specifically requiring partial order history H extended total order Adya imposes whenever H instant time event take place execution database lead H le instant time take place
Choosing order event extend partial order history H needed one want prove correctness abstract specification
set property history satisfy respect given specification
Let turn Question case seems Adya want stress fact allows implementation database access version object precedes version order latest version installed
In practice choosing earlier version object could either result database able access version
lost update anomaly causal consistency user explicitly requesting access older version object
accessing older version revision SVN repository

In attempt simplify allowing group load store instruction execute way
It mechanism analogous controlling access
Transactional memory system provide high level abstraction alternative low level thread synchronization
This abstraction allows coordination concurrent read writes shared data parallel system
In concurrent programming synchronization required parallel thread attempt access shared resource
Low level thread synchronization construct lock pessimistic prohibit thread outside making change
The process applying releasing lock often function additional overhead workload little conflict among thread
Transactional memory provides allowing thread run parallel minimal interference
The goal transactional memory system transparently support region code marked transaction enforcing
A transaction collection operation execute commit change long conflict present
When conflict detected transaction revert initial state prior change rerun conflict removed
Before successful commit outcome operation purely speculative inside transaction
In contrast synchronization operation serialized prevent data corruption transaction allow additional parallelism long operation attempt modify shared resource
Since programmer responsible explicitly identifying lock order acquired program utilize transactional memory produce
With construct place transactional memory provides high level programming abstraction allowing programmer enclose method within transactional block
Correct implementation ensure data shared thread without going transaction produce outcome
For example code written In code block defined transaction guaranteed atomicity consistency isolation underlying transactional memory implementation transparent programmer
The variable within transaction protected external conflict ensuring either correct amount transferred action taken
Note concurrency related bug still possible program use large number transaction especially software implementation library provided language unable enforce correct use
Bugs introduced transaction often difficult debug since breakpoints placed within transaction
Transactional memory limited requires abstraction
Although transactional memory program produce deadlock program may still suffer livelock resource
For example longer transaction may repeatedly revert response multiple smaller transaction wasting time energy
The abstraction atomicity transactional memory requires hardware mechanism detect conflict undo change made shared data
Hardware transactional memory system may comprise modification processor cache bus protocol support transaction
Speculative value transaction must buffered remain unseen thread commit time
Large buffer used store speculative value avoiding write propagation underlying protocol
Traditionally buffer implemented using different structure within memory hierarchy store queue cache
Buffers away processor cache hold speculative value megabyte
The optimal size buffer still debate due limited use transaction commercial program
In cache implementation cache line generally augmented read write bit
When hardware controller receives request controller us bit detect conflict
If serializability conflict detected parallel transaction speculative value discarded
When cache used system may introduce risk due use cache line granularity
offered many processor viewed basic transactional memory support however usually operates data size native machine word transaction supported
Although hardware transactional memory provides maximal performance compared software alternative limited use seen time
provides transactional memory semantics software programming language requires minimal hardware support typically atomic operation equivalent
As downside software implementation usually come performance penalty compared hardware solution
reduce overhead associated software transactional memory
Owing limited nature hardware transactional memory current implementation software using may require fairly extensive tuning fully benefit
For example dynamic memory allocator may significant influence performance likewise structure padding may affect performance owing cache alignment false sharing issue context virtual machine various background thread may cause unexpected transaction abort
One earliest implementation transactional memory gated store buffer used processor
However used facilitate speculative optimization binary translation rather form exposing directly programmer
Azul Systems also implemented hardware transactional memory accelerate appliance similarly hidden outsider
implemented hardware transactional memory limited form speculative multithreading
This implementation proved could used lock elision complex hybrid transactional memory system transaction handled combination hardware software
The Rock processor canceled acquisition actual product never released number prototype system available researcher
In proposed ASF set extension provide limited form hardware transactional memory support
The goal provide hardware primitive could used synchronization software transactional memory algorithm
However AMD announced whether ASF used product timeframe
More recently announced hardware support transactional memory speculative multithreading
The transactional memory could configured two mode first unordered mode write one transaction cause conflict transaction reading memory address
The second mode speculative multithreading providing ordered transactional memory
Speculative thread different version memory address hardware implementation keep track age thread
The younger thread access data older thread way around writes address based thread order
In case dependency thread cause younger version abort
TSX available processor
It earlier implemented processor well implementation turned time defective support TSX disabled
The TSX specification describes transactional memory API use software developer withholds detail technical implementation
As GCC experimental library transactional memory available utilizes hybrid implementation
The PyPy variant Python also introduces transactional memory language

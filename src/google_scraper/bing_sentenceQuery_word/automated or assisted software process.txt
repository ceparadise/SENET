Fundamentally two type control loop open loop control closed loop feedback control
In open loop control control action controller independent process output controlled process variable
A good example central heating boiler controlled timer heat applied constant time regardless temperature building
The control action switching boiler
The process output building temperature
In closed loop control control action controller dependent process output
In case boiler analogy would include thermostat monitor building temperature thereby feed back signal ensure controller maintains building temperature set thermostat
A closed loop controller therefore feedback loop ensures controller exerts control action give process output Reference input set point
For reason closed loop controller also called feedback controller
The definition closed loop control system according British Standard Institution control system possessing monitoring feedback deviation signal formed result feedback used control action final control element way tend reduce deviation zero
Likewise system tends maintain prescribed relationship one system variable another comparing function variable using difference mean control
The advanced type automation revolutionized manufacturing aircraft communication industry feedback control usually involves taking measurement using making calculated adjustment keep measured variable within set range
The theoretical basis closed loop automation
The control action form controller output action

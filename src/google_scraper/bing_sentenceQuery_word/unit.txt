Historically number bit used encode text computer depended computer hardware architecture today almost always mean eight bit
A byte represent distinct value integer
The specifies B upper case symbol byte
Bytes multiple thereof almost always used specify size computer file capacity storage unit
Most modern computer peripheral device designed manipulate data whole byte group byte rather individual bit
A group four bit half byte sometimes called nybble
This unit often used context number representation since nibble amount information one hexadecimal digit
Computers usually manipulate bit group fixed size conventionally called
The number bit word usually defined size computer number data bit fetched single operation
In architecture commonly known word bit past current architecture use word bit others

A definite defined adopted convention law used standard measurement kind quantity
Any quantity kind expressed multiple unit measurement
For example
The unit length represents definite predetermined length
When say metre actually mean time definite predetermined length called metre
Measurement process determining large small physical quantity compared basic reference quantity kind
The definition agreement practical use unit measurement played crucial role human endeavour early age present
A multitude used common
Now global standard SI modern form
In trade often subject governmental regulation ensure fairness transparency
The BIPM tasked ensuring worldwide uniformity measurement traceability International System Units SI
science developing nationally internationally accepted unit measurement
In metrology unit standard physical quantity need clear definition useful
experimental result central
A standard system unit facilitates
Scientific system unit refinement concept weight measure historically developed commercial purpose
often use larger smaller unit measurement used everyday life
The judicious selection unit measurement aid researcher see example
In standard unit measurement theory practice measurement studied
A unit measurement standardised physical property used factor express occurring quantity property
Units measurement among earliest tool invented human
Primitive society needed rudimentary measure many task constructing dwelling appropriate size shape fashioning clothing bartering food raw material
The earliest known uniform system measurement seem created sometime among ancient people perhaps also well
Weights measure mentioned Leviticus
It commandment honest fair measure
In The Great Charter seal put Barons England King John agreed Clause There shall one measure wine throughout whole realm one measure ale one measure London quart one width dyed russet hauberk two ell selvage As Century multiple unit system used world United States Customary System British Customary System International System
However United States industrialized country yet completely converted Metric System
The systematic effort develop universally acceptable system unit date back French National Assembly charged French Academy Sciences come unit system
This system precursor metric system quickly developed France take universal acceptance The Metric Convention Treaty signed nation
After treaty signed General Conference Weights Measures CGPM established
The CGPM produced current SI system adopted conference weight measure
Currently United States society us SI system US Customary system
Historically many system measurement use extent based dimension human body
As result unit measure could vary location location person person
A number unit
The current international standard metric system abbreviated SI
An important feature modern system
Each unit universally recognized size
Both derive earlier
Imperial unit mostly used former
US customary unit still main system measurement used despite Congress legally authorized metric measure July
Some step towards US made particularly redefinition basic US imperial unit derive exactly SI unit
Since agreement US imperial inch defined exactly US imperial avoirdupois pound defined exactly
While system unit based arbitrary unit value formalised standard unit value occur naturally science
Systems unit based called
Similar natural unit au convenient measurement used
Also great number may encountered
These may include energy released detonating one million ton TNT
To reduce incidence retail fraud many national standard definition weight measure may used hence statute measure verified legal officer
Different system unit based different choice set
The widely used system unit International System Units
There seven
All derived base unit
For quantity unit necessary communicate value physical quantity
For example conveying someone particular length without using sort unit impossible length described without reference used make sense value given
But quantity require unit
Using physical law unit quantity expressed combination unit quantity
Thus small set unit required
These unit taken
Other unit
Derived unit matter convenience expressed term basic unit
Which unit considered base unit matter choice
The base unit SI actually smallest set possible
Smaller set defined
For example unit set unit
This based physical law show electric magnetic field actually different manifestation phenomenon
Any value expressed comparison unit quantity
For example value physical quantity expressed product unit Z numerical factor The multiplication sign usually left left variable scientific notation formula
The convention used express quantity referred
In formula unit Z treated specific magnitude kind physical see treatment
Units added subtracted type however unit always multiplied divided used explain
Let candlestick cabdriver A distinction made unit standard
A unit fixed definition independent physical condition temperature
By contrast standard physical realization unit realizes unit certain physical condition
For example metre unit metal bar standard
One metre length regardless temperature metal bar exactly one metre long certain temperature
There certain rule used dealing unit involves comparison different standard physical value either single physical quantity physical quantity combination physical quantity
Starting replace original unit meaning term desired unit
Now numerical value calculate product
Or mathematically thing multiply unity product still For example expression physical value involving unit want term unit Or example using metric system value fuel economy unit want term unit One example importance agreed unit failure accidentally destroyed mission Mars September instead entering orbit due miscommunications value force different computer program used different unit measurement versus
Considerable amount effort time money wasted
On April cargo lost due crew confusing tower instruction metre altimeter reading foot
Three crew five people ground killed

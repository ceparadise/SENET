In data element made available time
A stream thought item processed one time rather large batch
Streams processed differently normal function operate stream whole potentially unlimited data formally stream potentially unlimited data finite
Functions operate stream producing another stream known connected analogously
Filters may operate one item stream time may base item output multiple item input
The term stream used number similar way Streams used underlying data type
The term stream also applied multiple set data associated single filename
Most often one main stream make normal file data additional stream contain
Here stream used indicate variable size data opposed fixed size metadata differs stream used otherwise meaning data available time potentially infinite

What stream programming world
Why need
Kindly explain help analogy possible
A stream represents sequence object usually byte necessarily accessed sequential order
Typical operation stream A particular stream might support reading case input stream writing output stream
Not stream seekable
Push back fairly rare always add stream wrapping real input stream another input stream hold internal buffer
Reads come buffer push back data placed buffer
If nothing buffer push back stream read real stream
This simple example stream adaptor sits end input stream input stream something extra original stream
Stream useful abstraction describe file really array hence seek straightforward also terminal seekable unless buffered socket serial port etc
So write code say either I want data I care come got I produce data entirely caller happens
The former take input stream parameter latter take output stream parameter
Best analogy I think stream conveyor belt coming towards leading away sometimes
You take stuff input stream put stuff output stream
Some conveyor think coming hole wall seekable reading writing deal
Some conveyor laid front move along choosing whereabouts stream want seeking
As IRBMe say though best think stream term operation offer vary implementation implementation lot common rather physical analogy
Streams thing read write
When start connecting stream adaptor think box conveyor conveyor connect stream box performs transformation data zipping changing UNIX linefeeds DOS one whatever
Pipes another thorough test metaphor create pair stream anything write one read
Think wormhole A stream already metaphor analogy really need povide another one
You think basically pipe flow water water actually data pipe stream
I suppose kind pipe stream
It basically common abstraction placed upon thing flow sequence data one direction
In language C Java stream metaphor used many thing
There file stream open file read stream write There network stream reading writing stream read writes underlying established network connection
Streams writing typcically called output stream example similarly stream reading called input stream example
A stream perform transformation encoding data example eat SSL negotiation data hide A TelnetStream might hide Telnet negotiation provide access data A Java allows write file zip archive without worry internals zip file format
Another common thing might find textual stream allow write string instead byte language provide binary stream allow write primitive type
A common thing find textual stream character encoding aware
Some stream also support random access example
A network stream hand obvious reason would
UNIX like operating system also support stream model program input output described
In addition thing mentioned different kind stream defined functional programming language Scheme Haskell possibly infinite datastructure generated function
Another analogy You ca swim stream take next bit byte string object stream already read data deleted
A basically without storing persistence
So need queue
You decide
The word stream chosen represents real life similar meaning want convey use
Start thinking analogy water stream
You receive continuous flow data like water continuously flow river
You necessarily know data coming often need file socket source really matter
This similar receiving stream water whereby need know coming lake fountain source really matter

The USGS Water Science School previous page Floods drought glacier Q A home River stage important concept analyzing much water moving stream given moment
Stage water level arbitrary point usually zero height near river bed river commonly measured foot
For example normal day rain fallen river might stage foot baseflow condition
If big storm hit river stage could rise foot
This important past record might know stage hit foot water start flowing bank basement house along river time tell people move dog bed upstairs
In picture see common Geological Survey USGS staff tall ruler marked inch
This allows someone quickly look water level get pretty accurate reading current gage height stream
How high fast river rise storm depends many thing
Most important course much rain falling
But also look thing stage river storm begin soil like drainage basin raining soil already saturated water previous storm
hard part rain falling
The USGS studied thing many place across country many year thus often able make prediction flood occur bad flood
With advent modern computer satellite technology USGS monitor stage many stream almost instantly
Since stream especially normally arid Western rise dramatically matter minute major storm important able remotely monitor fast water rising real time order warn people might affected dangerous flood
Recreational user stream kayakers also use data tell certain stream right height kayaking
The USGS gather data river stage even produce graph showing stage rain URL http Page Contact Information Page Last Modified Friday EST

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet

Glasgow Interactive Systems Group GIST Department Computer Science Glasgow University Glasgow
Tel Fax EMail This paper argues expanding scope science make difficult sustain traditional scientific engineering model research
In particular recent work formal method abandoned traditional empirical method
Similarly research requirement engineering human computer interaction challenged proponent formal method
These tension stem fact Science misnoma
Topics currently considered part discipline computing science technology rather theory driven
This creates problem academic department impose scientific criterion assessment PhDs
It therefore important people ask Research Computing Science starting higher degree
This paper intended high level introduction first year research student student advanced MSc course
It read conjunction research skill computing science
Good research practice suggests begin defining term
The Oxford Concise dictionary defines research However many reason approach unsatisfactory model research
The main objection carry high risk
For example artefact may fail long learn anything conclusion seeking support
Indeed often case approach ignores formation clear hypothesis conclusion artefact built
This may lead artefact become important researcher idea intended establish
The lack clear hypothesis need barrier might seem
The proof demonstration approach much common current engineering practice
Iterative refinement used move implementation gradually towards desired solution
The evidence elicited previous failed attempt used better define goal research work progress
The key problem iterative development artefact turn requires method structure
Engineers need carefully plan way fault found one iteration fed back subsequent development
This typically done testing technique based upon model scientific argument
This close relationship engineering scientific method surprising There many problem standard approach scientific empiricism applied computing science
The principle objection many aspect computing defy use probabilistic measure analysing result empirical test
For example many statistical measure rely upon independence test hypothesis
Such technique clearly used attempting measure performance system attempt optimise performance time rule load balancing algorithm etc
Secondly difficult impose standard experimental condition upon product computer science
For example program behaves one way one set operating condition guarantee behave way another set condition
These condition might go level alpha particle hitting memory chip
Thirdly difficult generalise result tightly controlled empirical experiment
For example user find system easy use evaluation guarantee another user able use product amidst distraction everyday working environment
Finally difficult determine sufficient number trial conducted support many hypothesis
For example attempt prove program always satisfies property almost certainly doomed failure using standard experimental technique The number potential execution path even simple code make impossible test property every possible execution path
The field mathematical reasoning research area right
It however possible identify two different approach use formal proof research technique computing science The first incredible care need made interpretation result mathematical proof
Formal method nothing system argumentation mistake expected
Problems arise mistake difficult detect given complex nature mathematics often used
Recall central feature empirical approach open peer review used check method correct
The second problem formal reasoning scope limited
Interactive time critical system pose specially challenge application mathematics
These issue addressed many problem remain
The third problem relates cost applying formal technique
It take long time acquire necessary skill
Similarly take several month conduct relatively simple proof medium large scale application
Finally argued inadequate discussion failure formal method
Again important recall failure prove hypothesis valuable result empirical technique
Exaggerated claim made formal reasoning typically researcher many claim falsified
As result error application mathematical reasoning seen source shame rather learning opportunity one colleague peer

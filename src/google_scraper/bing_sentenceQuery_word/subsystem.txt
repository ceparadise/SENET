One make simplified representation model system order understand predict impact future behavior
These model may define structure behavior system
Natural system There natural designed system
Natural system may apparent objective behavior interpreted purposefull observer
system made satisfy identified stated need purpose achieved delivery wanted output
Their part must related must designed work coherent entity otherwise would two distinct system
Theoretical framework An open system exchange matter energy surroundings
Most system open system like car coffeemaker computer
A closed system exchange energy matter environment like Earth project
An isolated system exchange neither matter energy environment
A theoretical example system Universe
Process transformation process An open system also viewed bounded transformation process black box process collection process transforms input output
Inputs consumed output produced
The concept input output broad
For example output passenger ship movement people departure destination

If trouble choosing IT degree path start asking following three career question interest The question find drawn clue type online degree prefer come Computer Information Systems v Computer Science
Many online IT degree offered today related Computer Science Information Technology Computer Information Systems
Each major share much common also tends focus answering slightly different question
These approach translate turn different career path
Computer Science focus teaching programming computing
It meant give professional foundational skill applied towards career coding
It also provides overview computer operating system work
Computer Science primarily sharpening programming ability
You learn write code lesson plan many online IT degree also learn code work computer way
A Computer Science major often focus programming underlying algorithm make code work
As fair amount math involved ex
Calculus Discrete Mathematics etc
This degree major especially math heavy undergraduate level

In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined

However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Information system specialist focus integrating information technology solution business process meet information need business enterprise enabling achieve objective effective efficient way
This discipline perspective information technology emphasizes information view technology instrument generating processing distributing information
Professionals discipline primarily concerned information computer system provide aid enterprise defining achieving goal process enterprise implement improve using information technology
A majority Information Systems IS program located business school
All IS degree combine business computing coursework
A variety IS program exist various label often reflect nature program
For example program Computer Information Systems usually strongest technology focus program Management Information Systems emphasize organizational behavioral aspect IS
Degree program name always consistent
A fourth area campus New Media computing discipline rather overlap computing user computer technology The New Media Program University Maine offer interdisciplinary course study system technology history design theory information
The curriculum enables student investigate creative applied process essential area study
It prepares student technologically capable articulate thinker creative medium professional
UMaine New Media Web site There confusion another area computing information technology
Note information technology IT differs meaning term used UMaine Strategic Plan author essentially mean The ACM IEEE differentiate IS IT follows
Whereas perspective IS emphasizes information technology viewed instrument generating processing distributing information Information Technology emphasize technology information conveys
IT new rapidly growing field started grassroots response practical everyday need business organization
Today organization every kind dependent information technology
They need appropriate system place
These system must work properly secure upgraded maintained replaced appropriate
Employees throughout organization require support IT staff understand computer system software committed solving whatever problem might
Graduates information technology program address need
Degree program information technology arose degree program computing discipline producing adequate supply graduate capable handling real need
IT program exist produce graduate posse right combination knowledge practical expertise take care organization information technology infrastructure people use

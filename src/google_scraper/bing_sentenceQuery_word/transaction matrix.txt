Suppose I simple vehicle moving
The state vector vehicle x vx vy ax ay contains position x velocity vx vy acceleration ax ay vehicle
assume acceleration x constant linear model control system look like
X AX Bu What matrix A state vector x
I look online understand example
Any help appreciated
Thanks First let start clean definition standard notation
Usually dynamic described continuous time x x B u Or discrete time x x k b u k Note I used bold x usually reserve capital letter matrix
I using notation
Now way actually put state vector x
Anything dynamic change time
Almost always go acceleration
So case would mean x array c array array c x x array This way write dynamic state vector get dynamic want x array c x x array array c array Where I used placeholder constant said acceleration
Note general would find function f x describes acceleration plug
So want write x term x
So
x array c array array cccc















array array c array array cccc array array c array array c array So notice I added term containing dependent state
This said acceleration constant meaning dynamic velocity change time stay constant
Well need put huh
I guessing made simplified version problem post actually choose
These would actually control input u instead simple would go term u
The way finding writing B much I leave

From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier

In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array

Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

information processing divided individual indivisible operation called
Each transaction must succeed complete unit never partially complete
For example purchase book online bookstore exchange money form credit book
If credit good series related operation ensures get book bookstore get money
However single operation series fails exchange entire exchange fails
You get book bookstore get money
The technology responsible making exchange balanced predictable called transaction processing
Transactions ensure resource permanently updated unless operation within transactional unit complete successfully
By combining set related operation unit either completely succeeds completely fails one simplify error recovery make one application reliable
Transaction processing system consist computer hardware software hosting application performs routine transaction necessary conduct business
Examples include system manage sale order entry airline reservation payroll employee record manufacturing shipping
Since though necessarily transaction processing today interactive term often treated synonymous
Transaction processing designed maintain system Integrity typically modern known consistent state ensuring interdependent operation system either completed successfully canceled successfully
For example consider typical banking transaction involves moving customer saving account customer checking account
This transaction involves least two separate operation computer term debiting saving account crediting checking account
If one operation succeeds book bank balance end day
There must therefore way ensure either operation succeed fail never inconsistency bank database whole
Transaction processing link multiple individual operation single indivisible transaction ensures either operation transaction completed without error none
If operation completed error occur others attempted system roll back operation transaction including successful one thereby erasing trace transaction restoring system consistent known state processing transaction began
If operation transaction completed successfully transaction system change database made permanent transaction rolled back done
Transaction processing guard hardware software error might leave transaction partially completed
If computer system crash middle transaction transaction processing system guarantee operation uncommitted transaction cancelled
Generally transaction issued concurrently
If overlap
need touch portion database create conflict
For example customer mentioned example saving account attempt transfer different person time moving checking account one succeed
However forcing transaction processed sequentially inefficient
Therefore concurrent implementation transaction processing programmed guarantee end result reflects outcome could reached executing transaction sequentially order property called
In example mean matter transaction issued first either transfer different person move checking account succeeds one fails
The basic principle system
However terminology may vary one system another term used necessarily universal
system ensure database integrity recording intermediate state database modified using record restore database known state transaction committed
For example copy information database modification transaction set aside system transaction make modification sometimes called
If part transaction fails committed copy used restore database state transaction began
It also possible keep separate modification database management system
sometimes called
This required rollback failed transaction useful updating database management system event database failure system provide
If database management system fails entirely must restored recent
The reflect transaction committed since made
However database management system restored journal image applied database bring database management system date
Any transaction progress time failure rolled back
The result database consistent known state includes result transaction committed moment failure
In case two transaction may course processing attempt access portion database time way prevents proceeding
For example transaction A may access portion X database transaction B may access portion Y database
If point transaction A try access portion Y database transaction B try access portion X occurs neither transaction move forward
system designed detect deadlock occur
Typically transaction cancelled rolled back started different order automatically deadlock occur
Or sometimes one deadlocked transaction cancelled rolled back automatically restarted short delay
Deadlocks also occur among three transaction
The transaction involved difficult detect point transaction processing system find practical limit deadlock detect
In system commit rollback mechanism available undesirable often used undo failed transaction restore system previous state
defined property reliable transaction system late acronym atomicity consistency isolation durability
A transaction change state atomic either happen none happen
These change include database change message action transducer
A transaction correct transformation state
The action taken group violate integrity constraint associated state
Even though transaction execute concurrently appears transaction T others executed either T T
Once transaction completes successfully commits change database survive failure retain change Transaction processing benefit Standard first developed often closely coupled particular
implemented similar principle mixed success
However recent year distributed model become considerably difficult maintain
As number transaction grew response various online service especially single distributed database practical solution
In addition online system consist whole suite program operating together opposed strict model single server could handle transaction processing
Today number transaction processing system available work level scale large system including
One effort DTP see also JTA
However proprietary environment IBM still popular although CICS evolved include open industry standard well
The term used describe transaction processing system uncommonly challenging requirement particularly throughput requirement transaction per second
Such system may implemented via distributed cluster style architecture

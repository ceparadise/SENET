The third normal form used
originally defined
Codd definition state table following condition hold A R attribute belong A determines indirectly virtue case
A definition equivalent Codd expressed differently given Carlo Zaniolo
This definition state table functional dependency least one following condition hold Zaniolo definition give clear sense difference stringent BCNF
BCNF simply eliminates third alternative Every element set difference A X prime attribute
An approximation Codd definition paralleling traditional give true evidence court law given Bill Kent Every attribute must provide fact key whole key nothing key
A common variation supplement definition oath help
Requiring existence key ensures table requiring attribute dependent whole key ensures requiring attribute dependent nothing key ensures
While phrase useful mnemonic fact mention single key mean defines necessary sufficient condition satisfy Normal Forms
Both concerned equally candidate key table one key
refers Kent summary intuitively attractive characterization note slight adaptation may serve definition slightly stronger Each attribute must represent fact key whole key nothing key
The version definition weaker Date BCNF variation former concerned ensuring attribute dependent key
Prime attribute key part key must functionally dependent represent fact key sense providing part key
It noted rule applies functionally dependent attribute applying attribute would implicitly prohibit composite candidate key since part key would violate whole key clause
An example table fails meet requirement Because row table need tell u particular Tournament particular Year composite key Tournament Year minimal set attribute guaranteed uniquely identify row
That Tournament Year candidate key table
The breach occurs attribute Winner Date Birth transitively dependent candidate key Tournament Year via attribute Winner
The fact Winner Date Birth functionally dependent Winner make table vulnerable logical inconsistency nothing stop person shown different date birth different record
In order express fact without violating necessary split table two Update anomaly occur table unlike primary key second table thus allowing one value
The definition offered Carlo Zaniolo given proven following way Let X A nontrivial
one X contain A let A attribute
Also let Y key Then Y X
Most table free update insertion deletion anomaly

Third normal form third step normalizing database build first second normal form
state column reference referenced data dependent primary key removed
Another way putting foreign key column used reference another table column parent table exist referenced table
Consider bank database contains two table storing customer detail storing detail bank account including customer hold account
In case need way link two table order tie account customer owns
The way via foreign key
This column table point reference corresponding column called primary key parent table
Let call column CustID
Suppose customer Andrew Smith creates account table CustID
Smith hold saving account number whose detail stored table
This mean table column called CustID original piece data
Instead also value simply reference CustID table
Now dictate table information hold customer CustID foreign key refers identifies customer owns CustID table Andrew Smith
No data customer name date birth gender stored table indeed table data already stored
By customer data stored outside table CustID
This pay handsome dividend ensuring data duplication turn make query run much efficiently reduces amount storage required

simply process organizing attribute relation reduce improve
Normalization also process simplifying design database achieves optimal structure composed atomic element
It first proposed integral part
Normalization involves arranging attribute based attribute ensuring dependency properly enforced database integrity constraint
Normalization accomplished applying formal rule either process synthesis decomposition
Synthesis creates normalized database design based known set dependency
Decomposition take existing insufficiently normalized database design improves based known set dependency
Edgar Codd inventor relational model RM introduced concept normalization known
Codd went define Codd defined BCNF
Informally relational database relation often described normalized meet third normal form
Most relation free insertion update deletion anomaly
A basic objective first normal form defined Codd permit data queried manipulated using universal data grounded
example data albeit one Codd regarded seriously flawed
The objective normalization beyond first normal form stated follows Codd When attempt made modify update insert delete relation following undesirable may arise relation sufficiently normalized When fully normalized database structure extended allow accommodate new type data aspect database structure remain largely entirely unchanged
As result application interacting database minimally affected
Normalized relation relationship one normalized relation another mirror concept interrelationship
Querying manipulating data within data structure normalized following representation customer credit card transaction involves complexity really necessary To customer corresponds group transaction
The automated evaluation query relating customer transaction therefore would broadly involve two stage For example order find monetary sum transaction occurred October customer system would know must first unpack group customer sum transaction thus obtained transaction fall October
One Codd important insight structural complexity reduced leading much greater power flexibility way query could formulated evaluated
A normalized equivalent structure might look like In modified structure key Cust
ID first relation Cust
ID Tr ID second relation
Now row represents individual credit card transaction DBMS obtain answer interest simply finding row Date falling October summing Amounts
The data structure place value equal footing exposing DBMS directly potentially participate directly query whereas previous situation value embedded structure handled specially
Accordingly normalized design lends query processing whereas unnormalized design
The normalized version also allows user change customer name one place guard error arise customer name misspelled record

Any schema satisfies BCNF also satisfies
But true BCNF necessarily guarantee dependency preservation whereas guarantee dependency preservation
Because two different concept
A schema satisfies iff every functional dependency relation key prime part key
A schema satisfies iff every functional dependency relation key
You clearly see definition every BCNF must also satisfy
However precisely reason achieve BCNF may need extra splitting relation could impossible preserve FDs
I give example say relation With FDs This relation since depends key prime however since BCNF prime clause relation fails BCNF due
On hand break relation meet BCNF FD lost

Third normal form database principle support integrity data building upon provided First Normal Form Second Normal Form
There two basic requirement database third normal form Let explore mean fact column must depend primary key
If column value derived primary key another column table violates
Consider Employees table column Do LastName FirstName depend value EmployeeID
Well could LastName depend FirstName
No nothing inherent LastName would suggest value FirstName
Could FirstName depend LastName
No true whatever LastName might could provide hint value FirstName
Therefore table compliant
But consider Vehicles table The Manufacturer Model could derive VehicleID Model could also derive Manufacturer vehicle model made particular manufacturer
This table design compliant could therefore result data anomaly
For example might update manufacturer without updating model introducing inaccuracy
To make compliant would need move additional dependent column another table reference using foreign key
This would result two table In table ModelID foreign key table This new table map model manufacturer
If want update vehicle information specific model would table rather Vehicles table
A table might contain derived field one computed based column table
For example consider table widget order The total break compliance derived multiplying unit price quantity rather fully dependent upon primary key
We must remove table comply third normal form
In fact since derived better store database
We simply compute fly performing database query
For example might previously used query retrieve order number total We use following query achieve result without violating normalization rule
There error

The third post focused definition example hammer home
Once table second normal form guaranteed every column dependent primary key I like say table serf single purpose
But relationship among column
Could dependency column could cause inconsistency
A table containing column employee age birth date spelling trouble lurks opportunity data inconsistency
How addressed
By
A table third normal form Wow
That mouthful
What mean
Let break
When something meaning relationship middle across whole
If help think prefix meaning When something transitive something applies beginning end also applies middle end
Since ten greater five five greater three infer ten greater three
In case greater comparison transitive
In general greater greater follows greater
If hard time wrapping head around transitive I think purpose safe think reviewing see one column table may related others second column
An object dependence another object relies upon
In case database say column dependence another column mean value derived
For example age dependent birthday
Dependence also play important role
Now let put two word together formulate meaning transitive dependence understand use database column
I think simplest think transitive dependence mean column value upon another column second intermediate column
Consider three column AuthorNationality Author Book
Column value AuthorNationality Author rely Book book known find Author AuthorNationality
But also notice AuthorNationality relies upon Author
That know Author determine nationality
In sense AuthorNationality relies upon Book via Author
This transitive dependence
This generalized three column A B PK
If value A relies PK B relies PK A also relies B say A PK B
That A transitively dependent PK
Let look example understand
To dependent mean column dependent primary key criterion normal form column table
Let review done far database
You see I found one transitive dependency Generally speaking postal code applies one city
Although column dependent primary key CustomerID opportunity update anomaly could update CustomerPostalCode without making corresponding update CustomerCity
We identified issue red
In order model third normal form need remove transitive dependency
As stated dependency It OK CustomerPostalCode relies CustomerID however break including CustomerCity table
To fix create new table PostalCode includes PostalCode primary key City sole column
The CustomerPostalCode remains customer table
The CustomerPostalCode designated foreign key
In way relation city postal code still known customer
In addition eliminated update anomaly
To better visualize Customer PostalCode table data
Now column customer table dependent primary key
Also column rely one another value
Their dependency primary key
The hold true PostalCode table
At point data model fulfills requirement third normal form
For practical purpose usually sufficient however case even data model refinement take place
If curious know advanced normalization form I would encourage read
Can database normalization taken far
You bet
There time worth time effort fully normalize database
In example could argue keep database second normal form CustomerCity CustomerPostalCode dependency deal breaker
I think normalize feel introducing update insert anomaly severely impact accuracy performance database application
If determine whether rely user recognize update field together
There time intentionally denormalize data
If need present summarized complied data user data time consuming resource intensive create may make sense maintain data separately
Several year ago I developed large engineering change control system home page showed engineer part issue task requiring attention
It database wide task list
The task list rebuilt using view
Performance fine couple year user base grew DB resource spent rebuild list time user visited home page
I finally redesign DB
I replaced view separate table initially populated view data maintained code avoid anomaly
We needed create complicated application code ensure always
For user experience worth
We traded complexity dealing update anomaly improved user experience
This post concludes series normalization
If want start beginning
follow
Remember
I want remind question want answered post comment

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I know make database efficient store data according relevance logical advantage
disadvantage
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Except logical aspect performance one divide data smaller table
Smaller table smaller index faster search option le memory IO consumption
One disadvantage I think longer code lot join query table
Another one divided data best option OLAP process sometimes see normalized table Data Warehouse environment
Third normal form includes rule lower level normal form second first normal form
Similarly normal form BCNF includes rule lower level see
Normalization provides advantage disadvantage mentioned
In level normalization type data redundancy data present removed model
Once redundancy removed easy change data since data present one place
By applying business rule le chance storing unwanted data table
Also le need storing Null value
In normalization ask lot question business people understanding business becomes stronger requirement business easy capture
Data Insert delete update reduced
Normalization split entity smaller number entity smaller table easier sorting indexing searching
Since many number smaller table many clustered index help query tuning
Normalized data model easier modify maintain
With many number table join table slower performance database
Having many number table consumes development time implementation
Completely normalized database need clear broad understanding business take time analyse understand business
I hope help
Thank

Fourth normal form level database normalization multivalued dependency candidate key
It build first three normal form Normal Form BCNF
It state addition database meeting requirement BCNF must contain one multivalued dependency
A multivalued dependency best illustrated using example
In table containing list three thing college course lecturer charge course recommended book course three element course lecturer book independent one another
Changing course recommended book instance effect course
This example multivalued dependency An item depends one value
In example course depends lecturer book
Thus state table one dependency

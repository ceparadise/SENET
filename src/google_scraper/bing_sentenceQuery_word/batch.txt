So make compiler batch compiler
A JIT compiler compiles code
program running
Therefore cost compilation part execution time program minimized
The opposite AOT compiler basically synonymous batch compiler
This convert source code machine code machine code distributed
Therefore compiler slow impact execution time resulting program
Nowadays people say compiler typically mean AOT compiler
Indeed term AOT compiler really started becoming popular relatively recently people started making AOT compiler JIT compiled language particularly JavaScript
Many language

processing processing output data soon input received
In contrast batch processing occurs input received processing output completed specified time
Whether company decides use either batch processing advantage disadvantage method
Since data entered processed immediately processing data accessed corrected immediately user
Data processed batch must follow structured protocol correcting error often take time
processing produce data data processed batch
It also likely produce accurate data since input tool readily available user
Batch processing using fewer peripheral device processing though cost saving reduced price peripheral device decrease time
Batch processing also allows business schedule computer used allowing efficient use computer hardware personnel time

Skip This document describes use cron system run program computer using AFS Stanford Computer Science Department
Some familiarity AFS assumed
One advantage using AFS offer strong protection file requiring Kerberos authentication list permission order access file
The downside strong security difficult run program interact anyone daemon mail delivery agent cron job
In particular cron job present problem ideally require system administrator intervention order work
Each user able create cron job see fit
The solution Computer Science Department offer called akcron
Using command create avatar alternate identity CS ID run unattended job using identity
user user normal CS ID
The first time run akcron must create special principal
To run akcron CS machine
xenon
You need
The system wish run cron job must enabled
To check run akcron token test
If get error message look like please send request ask host using enabled akcron
Since akcron execute special user must grant AFS permission user directory AFS want program access
For example cron job read file home directory must grant read permission CSID CSID
Similar step must taken directory different permission write
To run command using akcron use flag
For example cron job run program foo execute Gates Computer Science Building Serra Mall Stanford CA

Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction Batch Processing Using batch processing input data grouped together batch
No data processed complete batch put together
Then data batch processed one go
There may long time delay data input system data processed
In type system important data computer store time kept file called master file
The data master file sorted order using one field record file known primary key field
The primary key field must uniquely identify record file
Each piece input data update content master file known transaction
All input data put together batch file called transaction file
There three different type transaction processing system cope
They Add new record master file
Delete record master file
Amend update existing record master file
At predetermined time
end day week computer system process data stored transaction file make change necessary master file result transaction
This produce updated master file error report detailing transaction could processed reason
Middle At end week transaction file would processed
Before processing would sorted order master file
record order employee number
The computer would process transaction using information many hour employee worked week transaction file rate pay master file calculate employee wage week
Payslips printed master file updated increase amount paid far year wage paid week
An error report also produced
Transaction Processing Interactive Pseudo Real Time Processing For application master file need kept date time
For example travel agent whenever seat booked flight number seat remain available flight must reduced one immediately
If update done end day might happen batch processing system flight could become overbooked
Transaction processing system used whenever master file must kept date
A transaction processing system operates like When transaction entered placed queue transaction waiting made
The transaction processed order placed queue
Conclusion There real world time limit long computer system take process data without terrible consequence
Therefore missile control system real time system
Most real time system control system
Other example include cooling system nuclear reactor prevents reactor overheating system must control dangerous chemical reaction
Real time system fast process data instantly
Any processing take time
However real time system process data quickly
To ensure input data processed sufficiently quickly real time system must incorporate lot redundancy
This mean much hardware required process expected amount input data
The extra hardware known redundant hardware normally used
Under normal circumstance small fraction hardware required
In extreme circumstance unusually large amount input data process redundant hardware used
Therefore system slow still capable meeting deadline
Having incorporate lot redundant hardware make real time system expensive
They usually used safety critical situation
Advantage Systems Disadvantage Systems If system available would able certain job

missile guidance
system expensive produce require lot development time backup hardware redundancy

So start new month rush mail latest issue favorite magazine
You excited
Unfortunately excitement last fling open mailbox door realize magazine arrived cell phone bill
You sigh flip bill mind start wonder cell phone company manage data get bill many customer time every month
The answer batch processing
Unlike experience PC tablet use mouse touch screen big colorful display execute command batch processing different
Under model group one program referred perform specific set require user control
These program often said running background computer since interaction display feedback provided user execute
Outputs job might include inventory sale report complex research calculation paycheck billing statement utility like water bill cell phone provider
Since user interaction necessary information needed job execute must specified job start available appropriate step job order operation
When job complete different activity triggered message owner job printout generated statement
Additional job even started based output prior task
If right information ready needed missing completely job might take longer normal run might generate error end processing complete
When job fails complete successfully system operator receive alert message troubleshoot thing went wrong ask programmer look step job reviewing log error code input data file
In many instance job set run schedule depending task performed
Some job like credit card processing store owner might run daily basis close business sale day sent bank recording
Other job like utility bill run le frequently monthly even quarterly basis since make sense bill processed sent le often
After would want receive cell phone bill every week
That would pretty overwhelming
Get FREE access day create account
Batch processing also allows business get computer hardware executing job hour
During day employee use network server complete work go home end day resource would normally sit idle following morning
Businesses use batch processing take advantage idle time saving complex report generation processing effort called time scheduling job run people gone home evening
Resources would otherwise sitting idle working throughout night allowing company efficient get best return investment computing power
The next day staff return output job waiting people review use needed
Other company may choose run batch job regular office hour use complex scheduling monitoring tool ensure job consume many resource negatively impact office worker
For example scheduling execution process might start job order submitted following first first model often called short
Of course mean complex large job submitted start executing many smaller job need wait completion started
To get around common problem scheduler give priority smaller job require fewer resource complete executed faster delayed due complex job
A priority also set batch job submitted allows job given le computing resource execution
Consider situation job generates paycheck organization delayed unexpectedly encountered error execution
The owner job resubmit set run higher priority ensure get front line us computing power help guarantee timely completion
Conversely job owner might set batch job run lower priority work needed timely manner owner want negatively impact user system
So
allows run minimal human intervention following preset schedule priority long information needed execute job present
Additionally computing resource used day helping company get greatest return possible technology investment
When multiple job competing resource needed execute task operator set different level priority allow one job use le computing power
Doing ensure job important business operation come first allowing timely delivery business data service process output

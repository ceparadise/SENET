strategy knowledge ordering used variety field including software humanistic scientific theory see management organization
In practice seen style thinking teaching leadership
A approach also known case used synonym essentially breaking system gain insight compositional reverse engineering fashion
In approach overview system formulated specifying detailing subsystem
Each subsystem refined yet greater detail sometimes many additional subsystem level entire specification reduced base element
A model often specified assistance black box make easier manipulate
However black box may fail clarify elementary mechanism detailed enough realistically validate model
Top approach start big picture
It break smaller segment
A approach piecing together system give rise complex system thus making original system emergent system
processing type based incoming data environment form
From cognitive psychology perspective information enters eye one direction sensory input bottom turned image brain interpreted recognized perception output built processing final cognition
In approach individual base element system first specified great detail
These element linked together form larger subsystem turn linked sometimes many level complete system formed
This strategy often resembles seed model beginning small eventually grow complexity completeness
However organic strategy may result tangle element subsystem developed isolation subject local optimization opposed meeting global purpose
During design development new product designer engineer rely approach
The approach utilized existing component selected integrated product
An example would include selecting particular fastener bolt designing receiving component fastener fit properly
In approach custom fastener would designed would fit properly receiving component
For perspective product restrictive requirement weight geometry safety environment etc
approach taken almost everything custom designed
However important minimize cost increase component availability manufacturing equipment approach would taken many component bolt gear bearing etc
would selected possible
In latter case receiving housing would designed around selected component
In approach play key role
approach emphasize planning complete understanding system
It inherent coding begin sufficient level detail reached design least part system
approach implemented attaching stub place module
This however delay testing ultimate functional unit system significant design complete
emphasizes coding early testing begin soon first module specified
This approach however run risk module may coded without clear idea link part system linking may easy first thought
one main benefit approach
design promoted researcher
Mills developed concept practical use tested project automate morgue index
The engineering management success project led spread approach IBM rest computer industry
Among achievement Niklaus Wirth developer wrote influential paper
Since Niklaus Wirth went develop language one could define module knowing entire program specification one infer programming strictly promoted
method favored late assisted demonstrating idea aspect programming could utilized
Modern software design approach usually combine approach
Although understanding complete system usually considered necessary good design leading theoretically approach software project attempt make use existing code degree
module give design flavor
Some design approach also use approach partially functional system designed coded completion system expanded fulfill requirement project programming style mainstay traditional procedural language design begin specifying complex piece dividing successively smaller piece
The technique writing program using method write main procedure name major function need
Later programming team look requirement function process repeated
These compartmentalized eventually perform action simple easily concisely coded
When various coded program ready testing
By defining application come together high level lower level work
By defining lower level abstraction expected integrate higher level one interface become clearly defined
In approach individual base element system first specified great detail
These element linked together form larger subsystem turn linked sometimes many level complete system formed
This strategy often resembles seed model beginning small eventually grow complexity completeness
programming OOP paradigm us object design application computer program
In mechanical engineering software program Solidworks Autodesk Inventor user design product piece part whole later add piece together form assembly like building LEGO
Engineers call piece part design
In approach good intuition necessary decide functionality provided module
If system built existing system approach suitable start existing module
process analyzing input sequence read file keyboard order determine grammatical structure
This method used analysis
parsing strategy analyzing unknown data relationship attempt identify fundamental unit first infer structure
parser hand hypothesize general structure consider whether known fundamental structure compatible hypothesis

two approach manufacture product
These term first applied field nanotechnology order distinguish molecular manufacturing large atomically precise object conventional manufacturing large object atomically precise
approach seek smaller usually component built complex assembly approach seek create nanoscale device using larger externally controlled one direct assembly
Certain valuable nanostructures fabricated using either approach processing method selected basis targeted application
The approach often us traditional workshop microfabrication method externally controlled tool used cut mill shape material desired shape order
technique belong category
Vapor treatment regarded new secondary approach engineer nanostructures
approach contrast use property single molecule cause component useful conformation b rely positional assembly
These approach utilize concept
See also
Such approach broadly speaking able produce device parallel much cheaper method could potentially overwhelmed size complexity desired assembly increase
These term also employed discus flow information processing
Typically input considered information source considered
A process characterized absence higher level direction sensory processing whereas process characterized high level direction sensory processing cognition goal target Beiderman
According college teaching note written Charles Ramskov Rock Neiser Gregory claim approach involves perception active constructive process
Additionally approach directly given stimulus input result stimulus internal hypothesis expectation interaction
According Theoretical Synthesis stimulus presented short clarity uncertain give vague stimulus perception becomes approach
Conversely psychology defines processing approach wherein progression individual element whole
According Ramskov one proponent approach Gibson claim process includes visual perception need information available proximal stimulus produced distal stimulus
Theoretical Synthesis also claim processing occurs stimulus presented long clearly enough
Cognitively speaking certain cognitive process fast reaction quick visual identification considered process rely primarily sensory information whereas process control considered goal directed
Neurologically speaking area brain area mostly connection
Other area input higher brain area considered influence
The study provides example
If attention drawn flower field may color shape flower visually salient
The information caused attend flower came attention contingent upon knowledge flower outside stimulus sufficient
Contrast situation one looking flower
You representation looking
When see object looking salient
This example use information
In cognitive term two thinking approach distinguished
big chunk stereotypically visionary person see larger picture overview
Such people focus big picture derive detail support
small chunk cognition akin focusing detail primarily rather landscape
The expression seeing wood tree reference two style cognition
In field management organization term used describe decision made change implemented
A approach executive decision maker top person make decision something done
This approach disseminated authority lower level hierarchy greater lesser extent bound
For example wanting make improvement hospital hospital administrator might decide major change implementing new program needed leader us planned approach drive change frontline staff Stewart Manges Ward
A approach change one work large number people working together causing decision arise joint involvement
A decision number activist student victim incident take action decision
A approach thought incremental change approach represents emergent process cultivated upheld primarily frontline worker Stewart Manges Ward
Positive aspect approach include efficiency superb overview higher level
Also external effect internalized
On negative side reform perceived imposed difficult lower level accept
Maravall Przeworski
Evidence suggests true regardless content reform
Dubois
A approach allows experimentation better feeling needed bottom
Other evidence suggests third combination approach change see Stewart Manges Ward
Both approach found organization state involving political decision
In organized organization
ministry subordinate entity decision prepared expert field define expertise policy deem necessary
If agree even compromise problem next higher hierarchy level decision would sought
Finally highest common principal might take decision
Information debt inferior superior mean inferior owes information superior
In effect soon inferior agree head organization provides decision inferior agreed upon
Among several country German political system provides one purest form approach
The German Federal Act Public Service provides inferior consult support superior follow general guideline superior would fully responsible act office would follow specific formal complaint procedure doubt legality order
Frequently German politician leave office allegation took wrong decision resistance inferior expert opinion commonly called beratungsresistent resistant consultation German
The historical foundation approach lie fact century many politician used nobleman without appropriate education became forced rely consultation educated expert particular Prussian reform Stein Hardenberg enjoyed status financially personally independent indismissable neutral expert public servant public law
The experience two dictatorship country end regime emerging call legal responsibility aidees aidees regime also furnished call principle personal responsibility expert decision made leading strengthening approach requires maximum responsibility superior
A similar approach found British police law entitlement police constable vested constable person police administrative agency leading single constable fully responsible act office particular legality
In opposite French administration based approach regular public servant enjoy task simply execute decision made superior
As superior also require consultation consultation provided member distinctive regular ministry staff term staff organization
Those member member entitled make suggestion take decision political dimension
The advantage approach level expertise provided combined motivating experience member administration responsible finally independent engine progress field personal responsibility
A disadvantage lack democratic control transparency leading democratic viewpoint deferment actual power faceless even known public servant
Even fact certain politician might provide face actual decision inferior might mitigate effect rather strong parliamentary right control influence legislative procedure exist example Germany
The advantage principle political administrative responsibility clearly distinguished responsibility political failure clearly identified relevant office holder
Disadvantages system trigger demotivation inferior know idea innovative approach might welcome position make use full range expertise inferior collected
Administrations traditionally work according strict approach
As civil servant level political leadership discouraged making suggestion use suffer lack expertise could provided inferior regularly lead breakdown system decade
Modern form example therefore prefer define framework permissible even encouraged criticism inferior would affect major state doctrine allows use professional knowledge use person office
Both approach exist
There many example program often run government large IGOs many control
Examples program include many small NGOs set improve local access healthcare
However lot program seek combine approach instance international program currently run involved training many local volunteer boosting capacity international program hygiene sanitation access primary
Often school design said primarily promoted design taught architectural design begin basic plan drawing overall project
By contrast focused design
This method manifested study translating organizational system larger architectural scale woodpanel carving furniture design
In control refers top predator control structure population dynamic
The classic example ecosystem
In ecosystem predator
They prey turn eat
When otter removed urchin population grow reduce kelp forest creating
In word ecosystem controlled productivity kelp rather top predator
Bottom control ecosystem refers ecosystem nutrient supply productivity type primary producer plant phytoplankton control ecosystem structure
An example would plankton population controlled availability nutrient
Plankton population tend higher complex area upwelling brings nutrient surface
There many different example concept
It common population influenced type control

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
The name overall process developing start finish
When starting new software project important plan developed maintained
There different theory develop test software

In process dividing work distinct phase improve
It also known
The methodology may include specific artifact created completed project team develop maintain application
Most modern development process vaguely described
Other methodology include
Some people consider model general term category methodology software development process specific term refer specific process chosen specific organization
For example many specific software development process fit spiral model
The field often considered subset The software development methodology also known SDM framework emerge
According Elliott SDLC considered oldest formalized methodology framework building
The main idea SDLC pursue development information system deliberate structured methodical way requiring stage life inception idea delivery final carried rigidly sequentially within context framework applied
The main target methodology framework develop large scale functional age large scale business conglomerate
Information system activity revolved around heavy routine
Methodologies process framework range specific proscriptive step used directly organization work flexible framework organization us generate custom set step tailored need specific project group
In case sponsor maintenance organization distributes official set document describe process
Specific example include It notable since DSDM methodology list except RUP agile methodology yet many organisation especially government still use process often waterfall similar
Software process closely interrelated unexpected facet effect observed practice Since early scaling agile delivery process become biggest challenge team using agile process
Among another software development process established
The adoption best practice known established process within confines company called
Several software development approach used since origin information technology two main category
Typically approach combination approach chosen management development team
Traditional methodology waterfall distinct phase sometimes known SDLC methodology though term could also used generally refer methodology
A life cycle approach distinct phase contrast Agile approach define process iteration design construction deployment different piece occur simultaneously
practice merging developer working copy shared several time day
first named proposed CI although advocate integrating several time day
XP adopted concept CI advocate integrating per day perhaps many ten time per day
creating prototype
incomplete version software program developed
The basic principle A basic understanding fundamental business problem necessary avoid solving wrong problem true software methodology
Various method acceptable combining linear iterative system development methodology primary objective reduce inherent project risk breaking project smaller segment providing development process
There three main variant incremental development RAD software development methodology favor rapid construction instead large amount planning
The planning software developed using RAD interleaved writing software
The lack extensive generally allows software written much faster make easier change requirement
The rapid development process start development preliminary using
In next stage requirement verified using prototyping eventually refine data process model
These stage repeated iteratively development result combined business requirement technical design statement used constructing new system
The term first used describe software development process introduced
According Whitten merger various especially prototyping technique accelerate software system development
The basic principle rapid application development Agile software development refers group software development methodology based iterative development requirement solution evolve via collaboration team
The term coined year formulated
Agile software development us iterative development basis advocate lighter viewpoint traditional approach
Agile process fundamentally incorporate iteration continuous feedback provides successively refine deliver software system
There many agile methodology including The waterfall model sequential development approach development seen flowing steadily downwards like waterfall several phase typically The first formal description method often cited article published although Royce use term waterfall article
Royce presented model example flawed model
The basic principle The waterfall model traditional engineering approach applied software engineering
A strict waterfall approach discourages revisiting revising prior phase complete
This inflexibility pure waterfall model source criticism supporter flexible model
It widely blamed several government project running budget time sometimes failing deliver requirement due approach
Except contractually required waterfall model largely superseded flexible versatile methodology developed specifically software development
See
In published formal software system development spiral model combine key aspect methodology effort combine advantage concept
It provided emphasis key area many felt neglected methodology deliberate iterative risk analysis particularly suited complex system
The basic principle Other software project methodology include Some abstract description evaluating comparing improving specific process adopted organization
A variety framework evolved year recognized strength weakness
One software development methodology framework necessarily suitable use project
Each available methodology framework best suited specific kind project based various technical organizational project team consideration
organization implement process methodology ease process development
Sometimes contractor may require methodology employed example requires rating based obtain contract
The international standard describing method selecting implementing monitoring life cycle software
A goal find repeatable predictable process improve productivity quality
Some try systematize formalize seemingly unruly task designing software
Others apply technique designing software
Large number software project meet expectation term functionality cost delivery schedule see notable example
Organizations may create SEPG focal point process improvement
Composed line practitioner varied skill group center collaborative effort everyone organization involved software engineering process improvement
A particular development team may also agree programming environment detail used one dominant rule choice specific
These detail generally dictated choice model general methodology

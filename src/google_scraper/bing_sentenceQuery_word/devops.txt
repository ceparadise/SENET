submitted Just like System Administration job starting require skill think future DevOps role going require understanding computer science fundamental
Now I know alot different definition DevOps DevOps NOT job specifically referring role within culture general DevOps role like system administration skill DevOps role resembles SRE like
The latter category would require CS knowledge virtue work involved former sysadmin automation skill could get without really knowing CS
Just like system administrator ca automate likely struggle job security future sysadmin automation skill people really understand CS engineering knowledge like distributed system operating system struggle job security
Or able sufficient good job security distant future

Devops automation coding I actually talk I given company customer process tool
I come across way many team use x proces picked tool cause heard tool best
The talk give common example show messy complicated pipeline result
I DevOps guy I work I get pulled meeting technical lead plan project dropped team short period I make helpful suggestion anything automating metric collection dockerising project teaching new branching strategy
This DevOps really job title software engineer tester system infrastructure Admins even security need development deploy release pipeline
Testers system admins need embrace scripting group need CS degree basic understanding system engineering
The hardest group I discovered system administrator normally learnt window want rest laurel even limit single thing network guy ad guy
That group people replaced people understand scripting manage environment
This sort thing fair closer system admin coding require CS degree
Ironically UK Computer Science degree teach engineering CS next hardest group
As far I tell learn emulate processor either Java C
Most view coder resistant anything else
Is talk mention beginning comment available somewhere
Even available text form redacted name would make good read
I check work
Sure thing
Thanks
The hardest group I discovered system administrator normally learnt window want rest laurel even limit single thing network guy ad guy
That group people replaced people understand scripting manage environment
Just give anecdotal confirmation London ton Windows sysadmin guy yet almost job sort role company moving devops stuff mentioned
But recruiter DESPERATE Linux folk openstack scripters python coder AWS experience
despite market people want change though one guy worked consultant work inside lot company ops team etc refused learn form whatsoever
He mostly window sysadmin nothing else sysadmins employer getting laid drove moved devops approach
His employer even gave month working inside team learn python AWS stuff would put hand air say understand rather trying learn
In month never completed single story sprint always said know coder endless excuse etc
People would pair program offer help saw sysadmin
So stubborned job world hiring sysadmins script
Did offer pay sysadmin salary junior developer top existing sysadmin salary precisely DevOps salary range equates
If smart work market rate As relatively junior software developer I tell end expected make change infrastructure estate case heavily tied company legacy estate
We limited visibility whole system set see code high level reasoning hard come wrong change cause terraform explode new exciting way
So either choose take risk potentially bring company modern infrastructure spend age consulting people piecemeal get change
Personally I perfectly willing learn whatever technology point provided work relatively reliable predictable fashion wo result smashing face keyboard Friday night
Thats basic support issue face inherited code base
Its good rage inducing way learn make something maintainable
I talking people see job cutting code think development infrastructure script anything
I think CS graduate stand taught coding engineering lifecycle vocal subset come job thinking creating cool algorithm
I going keep repeating outside usual big city tech hub company large able willing perform devops almost sense espoused subreddit
This great majority software ops organization outside bubble tech elite disgusting ops personnel abused routinely career suffer
What use Gene Kim term horse honestly want need even sysadmins efficient scale current situation tend pretty desperate work firefighting term culture alcoholism routine
Why happen
Oftentimes simply poorly designed software ops person must support poorly designed engineered software ton churn development side
And without trying earnest chip away technical debt get piled keep light nobody work
Furthermore pay organization tends rather mediocre business large likely pressure due simply mediocre business performance
The good news I personally seen organization turned around basic automation must commit effort simply hire one two people call devops engineer expect fix everything wrong engineering process usually sign inexperienced panicked management usually better walk one place consultant leave n month long I expect stay business
A CS degree required capacity learn Linux kernel fundamental even distributed system fundamental level
To get past certain level knowledge though might well gotten degree much foundational knowledge need
Like need know compare different process scheduler based upon certain algorithmic characteristic
For idea CS degree would help somewhat related SRE work read Google new er TCP congestion control algorithm BBR ask interested importantly capable contributing effort like rigorously
Devops engineer strong programming background especially one CS fundamental basically unicorn I read seems field geared around system administrator worked large scale big iron
Without dissing forefather developer oriented devopsers better
We fairly interesting thing company regard thing like better PXE service provisioning across thousand host I think begun scratch surface sort programming skill needed
Mushing together hack script mush everything else Cobbler dhcpd dns tftp kickstarts database jira etc developing competent cohesive product quite challenge
I backend programmer many year first time domain actually Linux box I used past year instead obnoxious stuff like front end ecommerce marketing certainly helped thing
I sort strong CS background jack none I glad found people team
Jack trade master none yet oftentimes better master one look adding ansible tower
You integrate thing together
Even use ansible lot thing mentioned
I think likely find SOME job like overall likely succeed move forward role understand engineering well system
Nothing
For sysadmin fight technology bad one
Do care many year working I wo hire someone think manually clicking Windows example working smarter
The automate better
As time come automated
My goal automate team job
As sysadmin I always required hire scripting skill plus programming skill
We declined sysadmins claim year experience script proud
As far I concerned scripting key good sysadmin
I self taught hobby programmer starting full time programmer mid LAN admin hobby Unix full time Unix admin past year
I learned scripting I know scripting exposed CM I barely anything scripting
I able everything ansible I anymore
Sure mixed environment still need script able script help making better playbook
If DevOps role part deployment pipeline deal new product possibly upgrading existing product
As sysadmin I also deal server support Ansible
I server Red Hat plus Solaris
We recently finally retired server corporate even older kit Red Hat yes old
This DevOps SR new tech rule well course one going supported hvanet run type env well work anymore waste time making script automate faster
ansible ca thrn u create module
although ansible support solaris aix
problem system look like company problem
Well problem Unfortunately everyone even considers asking new environment interviewing
So work environment show least ask server version company running accepting job show foresight
The business folk interest replacing server expend resource upgrade
With product place understndable would expensive upgrade even large virtual environment
Again though DevOps person dealing existing kit new kit
So managing old gear view Cinema major Theatre Computer Science minor
I say I wave people devops group people pushing envelope cutting edge technology process
Devops also breaking silo giving name new
Sysadmins expertise working closely developer expertise useful either taking formal training field IMO
Yes
Most tech company use software engineer run infrastructure
Many company aspiring tech company culture process main line business
Ergo company would best served software engineer running infrastructure
Devops culture strategy everyone team need understand follow
However sake question I assuming devops guy someone installs configures CI tool perform deployment automate repeated task As per definition I feel whole process automated
For instance developer writes code kind test
Architect specifies tool kind deployment need container vm The tool would get latest code compile deploy per configuration
This one time activity
So I think future wo devops specific person long run
The automated tool take care everything
Only developer needed write code push

I really glad talking making career Devops still student thats best time find passion get started plan future rather clueless graduate
So congratulation proactive
One important thing future employer would like look done student apart sitting curriculum
Before proceed I would recommend look previous answer Above post provide pretty good answer devops skill would matter whether interesting enough
Now Student could get started improve chance getting employed immediately graduate Once get college seek opportunity get Dont worry money first job focus learning
I would advise opt sysops system engineer even system admin job good startup start
Devops le extension sysops skill
A good internet startup would actually using least tool would good platform learn transform full fledged devops professional
Again make sure sound startup product company large service company
If want relatively dry introduction Ops general free online equivalent text book
The advantage skip part know like basic linux command available Fiddling still probably one best option
Build basic Rails app attempt deploy AWS GCP
Then read VPC construction security best practice When little along get bored reading want play try
One Engineers wrote thing setting Kubernetes cluster AWS give idea best practice
Disclaimer big fan Kubernetes
There two main aspect DevOps different learning computer scientist
Get started looking thing
For actually building career take job startup Developers need also run operation
learn entire application lifecycle understand DevOps world side
Once resume hirable DevOps Engineer SRE quickly
Good luck
It depends side DevOps want follow
There shared area
must understand coding continuous delivery matter want Developer Operations
My experience Ops side experience development helped lot I started work instead system administrator
As infrastructure developer focus automate thing related infrastructure
It requires strong programming skill good scripting
forget cultural thing around DevOps collaboration communication etc
Still question
Ask

DevOps software development phrase used mean type relationship development IT operation
The goal DevOps change improve relationship advocating better communication collaboration two business unit
In enterprise need break silo business unit operate individual entity within enterprise management process information guarded
On software development side working IT operation need better communication collaboration best serve IT business need organization
One answer breaking enterprise silo move towards culture partner developer operation staff ensure organization achieves optimal running software minimal problem

software engineering culture practice aim unifying software development Dev software operation Ops
The main characteristic DevOps movement strongly advocate step deployment
DevOps aim shorter development cycle dependable release close alignment business objective
At Toronto conference Andrew Shafer Patrick Debois introduced term talk Agile Infrastructure
From DevOps term steadily promoted brought mainstream usage series devopsdays started spread country
The term DevOps used multiple different context
A definition proposed Bass Weber Zhu DevOps set practice intended reduce time committing change system change placed normal production ensuring high quality
In recent year tangential DevOps initiative also evolved OpsDev BizDevOps
As DevOps intended mode working rather single DevOps tool set multiple tool
Such DevOps tool expected fit one category reflective key aspect development delivery process Some category essential DevOps toolchain others especially continuous integration
infrastructure code

The need DevOps arose increasing success agile software development led organization wanting software faster frequently
As sought overcome strain put release management process adopt pattern tool
Continuous delivery DevOps common goal often used conjunction subtle difference
While continuous delivery focused automating process DevOps also focus organization change support great collaboration many function involved
DevOps continuous delivery share common background small frequent change focused value end customer
They well communicated collaborated internally thus helping achieve faster reduced risk
The application continuous delivery DevOps data analytics termed
DataOps seek integrate data engineering data integration data quality data security data privacy operation
It applies principle DevOps used improve cycle time extracting value data analytics
In developed new approach releasing new feature continuously system maintaining end user experience
While SRE predates development DevOps generally viewed independent trend
Some aspect DevOps taken similar approach
DevOps often viewed approach applying work cloud technology
The goal DevOps span entire delivery pipeline
They include Simple process become increasingly programmable dynamic using DevOps approach
DevOps aim maximize predictability efficiency security maintainability operational process
Very often automation support objective
DevOps integration target feature development order improve reliability security provide faster cycle
Many idea people involved DevOps came movement
Companies practice DevOps reported significant benefit including significantly shorter improved customer satisfaction better product quality reliable release improved productivity efficiency increased ability build right product fast experimentation
However study released January almost IT executive industry professional found one five surveyed think DevOps strategic impact organization despite rise usage
The study found identified DevOps key well public cloud infrastructure service
DevOps tool process change inherently requires organizational culture shift
This cultural change especially difficult conflicting nature departmental role Getting group work cohesively critical challenge enterprise DevOps adoption
While DevOps describes approach work rather distinct role like job advertisement increasingly using term like
While DevOps reflects complex topic DevOps community us analogy communicate important concept much like open source community
DevOps principle demand strong interdepartmental activity often create environment foster communication cultural change within organization
activity include trust activity employee engagement seminar
The term used reference DevOps practice applied context
While goal different DevOps delivers software product SciOps delivers scientific insight
An alternative interpretation term specialization DevOps
Companies frequent release may require DevOps awareness orientation program
For example company operates image hosting website developed DevOps approach support business requirement ten deployment per day daily deployment cycle would much higher organization producing application
This referred associated methodology
formed topic since
To practice DevOps effectively software application meet set ASRs deployability modifiability testability monitorability
These ASRs require high priority traded lightly
Although principle possible practice DevOps architectural style architectural style becoming standard building continuously deployed system
Because size service small allows architecture individual service emerge continuous refactoring hence reducing need big upfront design allows releasing software early continuously
Some article DevOps literature assume recommend significant participation DevOps initiative outside organization department
DevOps principle taken full enterprise
A survey published January SaaS company DevOps adoption increased percent percent
And among larger enterprise organization DevOps adoption even higher percent
Adoption DevOps driven many factor including process transforming adapting software development methodology accordance Agile development method opposed older Waterfall technique
Thanks transformation development operation team longer siloed often merged single unit development operation team work across entire application cycle enabling efficient DevOps process

What people seem forget young kid focused upon writing code get job school Googles Microsofts Amazons Apple FB whatever tech company around moment upon time Unix system administrator used ALL programmer
Your sysadmin coder wrote C get certain stuff done like writing random driver new piece hardware inadequate module anything like Ruby Lua Perl stuff like shell script
System administration started getting really bad name field forcibly opened specialized introduction Windows NT pretty much company started requiring administrator REALLY mundane thing introduced infancy corporate IT initiative early phase prior even introduction ITIL
Furthermore programmer moved away language focusing upon application development requires focused effort upon purely development task
So point really beginning already devops
Much devops movement everyone back together damage caused structuring separating operation development practice resulting siloization everyone across board devops Agile movement large champion
I think good solid familiarity software development coding make one better
Certainly could considered System Operators Administrators coding knowledge kind able figure modify configuration keep system running
But one shine field automate repetitive process like reporting management task regular request leaving focus harder challenging task
I think scare pass CS degree institution
Quite year ago I looked one college consideration finish CS degree
When I looked syllabus I shocked find level course thing like basic HTML PHP course
That I would end spending thousand dollar retaking course I already knowledge would paying privilege spend time certifying I already knowledge
And I could CLEP roughly curriculum
But I also drummed job jackhole middle manager changed job description requiring degree
In retrospect probably good thing however
Today I look resume coming across desk I look applicant college background insight one pedigree knowledge fundamental
But I focused took knowledge learned applied career
How would look someone military first college
I try figure military quickly advanced rank much much importantly whether type military person obsessed process order regimented ranking barely capable going week without commanding officer breathing neck get something accomplished
This simply analog GPA GPA undergrad mean something prescribed rule process understood respected enough go meet requirement
The highest GPA folk tend ironically among worst anything academia experience defense contractor govie I found higher ranking military folk inflexible anything military stay away
The bigger agenda devops movement within larger company break hierarchy silo equate getting result
These system mostly existed make life manager easier treat unit people dispoable replaceable little autonomy locality performance
Outside large company devops probably even uttered anymore I would hope people actually get something done oftentimes labeling people get way work like people
You IM people need get crap done pretty fast
You might infrastructure engineer site reliability engineer build engineer simply software engineer happens focus upon capacity scaling whatever
Completely agree
Being military brat I know regiment occurs
And I work quite retired military
I find longer competent MOS also sometimes require little inspiration think outside box
But see catch spark tend take task
No always I say pun line spotlight
I like
Just argue non degree holder hit fan
Egos worst
My brother month completing CS degree whereas I credit hour away basically given
I would enjoyed taking SQL class three java C class took
Hard write much time money class could help
I still edge going back unfilled resume checkbox annoying
I feel pressure article writer mentioned
I point job scripting report writing
The CS background would probably helped I could get as code academy MIT open course udemy etc etc
The advice I usually give people struggling get rut job follows Code show interview stop whining Internet wasting time cert degree already something else substitute trying code many damn random thing nothing
Everyone I seen done moved successfully forward towards promising career software developer regardless degree regardless prior career state regardless age
I give offer someone old enough dad I old either I guess rock contest
There simply developer know wtf company desperate someone idea code something prove
After get point join rest u miserable trying figure bounce around engineer oodles random opportunity everywhere decision making lot money money many year trading rather much money afford blow chasing wild dream

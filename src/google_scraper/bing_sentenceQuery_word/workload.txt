submitted Prospective computer science major
I currently also considering taking psychology minor UC wondering workload overwhelming
In addition school work I likely want get kind job well
Does sound doable workload much
Post comment
I heard tattoo artist Do get tattoo somewhere want hurt little bit short time
This forever
Decide based amount workload involved
If help I graduated undergrad computer engineering program minor mathematics computer science
The curriculum similar computer science
Some semester much intense others way really knowing much free time
probably little high hour figure average plenty week I spent much time
Keep mind everyone different optimal study habit
I suggest get program first test water
Good luck
Yeah plan far try workload computer science consider psychology minor second year
Thanks help
Every person ask different response
I chemical engineering major
So major everyone asks hard
Every person responds differently
Some say basically homework day every day study exam worried getting A
Some people social life homework last possible second put studying night manage A B get C fail
A question like entirely individual
Do I think chemE hard
Extremely
But I still time play game go friend etc
Hell I could probably manage part time I needed
However I friend feel like time anything ever
Ur totally right different people different thanks advice
It lot work
The CS class bad part usually taking time combine class like English Calculus require lot work outside class make rough
I think psychology minor would doable I would start least second since first year lot work
That said I think part time job psychology minor doable
There enough time day
Yeah thinking starting second year give time adjust
So I probably wait see well I adjust workload UC life
year CS
It really depends credit coming quick pick thing
Personally I came Calc Phys credit breeze thus far
I currently taking CS credit hour working part time
So definitely doable depends study habit
That good hear similar situation I entering little bit credit math possibly english relieve workload little
Thanks
deleted It cutting time get wasted
Not social time game time hour get wasted browsing internet reddit
And planning ahead help
It managing time really Assuming CS scale engineering engineering degree
I sure relatively heavy workload
That said I swim team fraternity different club also social life graduated B average
I also would say I good studying working hard I think doable work hard want get really good grade
technically engineering degree
A fuck load
They say work like extra hour week outside class get A lying
Its engineering degree
Its easy
Consider IT want practical application versus theory research
Also dont take calc
I find bad
A psych minor also doable
You take extra class
Thanks reply also take computer science major psychology minor
How far course
Assuming yet graduated I graduated last year CS major minor
I also worked hour week throughout entire program rarely felt overwhelmed
I looked adding psychology minor could fit course would major minor would require additional course would probably mean extra semester school
Just aware CS go
It necessarily programming even using computer
It organizing representing processing analyzing information using efficient correct method
I think understanding reason half CS class switch first year
Other I think lot people ca handle calculus
Yes I heard much misconception computer science made point research hopefully given good idea nature computer science
Damn sound tricky computer science major
How far course
PS Have already taken calc excused calc I would make significant difference
I longer one
The course little difficult require actually put forth decent effort
I could cut
O also didnt like type work I
I enjoy work IT much
I get actually apply skill learn diverse skill set
Digital medium favorite one sp far
I really enjpy using photoshop
I suggest trying add job engineering degree unless job study still effective
You need get adjusted year coop every quarter equivalent part time job whole year
I always committed percent either work study I think gave positive experience everyone different
Current CS senior
Workload bad experience coding prior starting
About third people c freshman coding since kid
seen line code get dept try fails teach middle help anybody
We really shitty graduation rate
I believe I started I came c student actually graduating people year
If still high school want c suggestion go literally school
Our professor part old touch real interesting adequately teaching student relevant material
For example Han teach material updated year
Our software design course give much paperwork actually time work programming project
The professor teach seen industry decade understand teaching u worst practice fail building thing real world
There standout prof Talaga Franco mostly outnumbered one new prof come google quit year dept refused let curriculum
Ever major engineering school supposed curriculum review every year c dept found technicality let never take look refreshing updating curriculum majority professor happy accept terrible state curriculum
The pushed curriculum review constantly shut
I came UC I gotten lot value I would consider I learned anything value modern CS course work
Rutgers Michigan penn purdue OSU substantially better choice CS still affordable public school
TL DR If want major CS come UC

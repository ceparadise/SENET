MICHAEL KEARNS Economics Computer Science Policy idea technique economics computer science yielding fresh insight help inform policy decision
Perhaps little decade ago might seemed scientist apply similar methodology problem diverse vaccination infectious disease eradication email spam screening baggage explosive packet forwarding computer network
But least two compelling commonality many problem
The first expressed strongly economic framework
For instance individual deciding whether seek vaccination disease may consider infectious overall population turn depends vaccination decision others
The second commonality problem considered take place underlying network structure may quite complex asymmetric
The vulnerability party infectious disease spam explosive depends strongly party interaction party
The growing importance network view scientific social problem well documented even popularized book Malcolm Gladwell central relevance economic principle problem beginning studied understood
The interaction network economic approach diverse challenging problem well impact interaction matter policy subject I explore
And nowhere interaction relevant actively studied field computer science
Research intersection computer science economics flourished recent year source great interest excitement discipline
One driver exchange realization many aspect important information network Internet might better understood managed improved viewed economic system rather purely technological one
Indeed network display property classically associated economic behavior including decentralization mixture competition cooperation adaptation free riding tragedy common
I begin simple compelling example economic thought computer science including potential application policy issue management spam
Later I argue power scale model algorithm computer scientist developed may turn provide new opportunity traditional economic modeling
The Internet provides perhaps richest source example economic inspiration within computer science
These example range macroscopic insight economic incentive Internet user service provider specific model behavior Internet protocol basic functionality packet routing
Across entire range economic insight often suggest potential solution difficult problem
To elaborate insight let u begin background
At practically every level detail Internet exhibit one basic hallmark economic system decentralization
It clear human user Internet decentralized population heterogeneous need interest incentive
What le widely known statement applies organization build manage maintain call monolithically Internet
In addition physically distributed Internet loose continually changing amalgamation administratively economically distinct disparate subnetworks often called autonomous system
These subnetworks vary dramatically size may operated institution simply need provide local connectivity autonomous system administered University Pennsylvania may business providing service profit large backbone provider like AT T
There great potential insight studying potentially competing economic incentive autonomous system user
Indeed formal contractual financial agreement different autonomous system specifying connectivity exchange data pricing interaction common
Against backdrop decentralized administration number prominent researcher posited many common problem associated Internet email spam virus attack fundamentally economic problem core
They may made possible networking technology one may look technological solution often effective attack problem economic root
For example many observer argue problem spam would best addressed upstream network
They contend efficient Internet service provider ISPs filter spam legitimate mail rather every end user install spam protection
But purely technological observation ignore question whether ISPs economic incentive address problem
Indeed noted ISPs contractual arrangement corporate customer charge fee based volume data carried customer
Thus principle ISP could view spam attack source potential revenue
An economic view problem spam proliferated creation nearly free public resource electronic mail whose usage unlimited resulted favorable return investment email marketing even infinitesimal take rate product service offered
One approach accept economic condition pursue technological defense spam filter whitelists blacklist email address
An alternative seek alter economic equation make spam profitable first place charging fee email sent
The charge sufficiently small email remains nearly free resource aside Internet access cost nearly sufficiently large eradicate greatly reduce spammer profitability
There many challenging issue worked scheme including paid aggregate micropayments
But mere fact computer scientist incorporating economics directly solution policy consideration represents significant shift view technology management
As example economic thought level Internet underlying protocol consider problem routing transmission data packet across network
Although delay second two unimportant email many Internet operation serious problem application teleconferencing Internet telephony latency transmission severely degrades usefulness
For application goal simply move data point A point B Internet find fastest possible route among innumerable possible path distributed network
Of course route fastest static
The speed electronic traffic like speed road traffic depends much traffic taking route electronic route similarly disrupted accident form temporary outage failure link
Recently computer scientist begun consider problem perspective
In formulation one regard network user whether human software player game goal route data one point another network
There many possible path source destination point different path constitute choice action available player
Being rational context mean choosing path minimizes latency suffered routing data
A series striking recent mathematical result established price anarchy measure much worse overall latency competitive equilibrium comparison best socialist centrally mandated nonequilibrium choice surprisingly small certain condition
In word many case much improvement network behavior even laborious centralized network design
In addition descriptive property result also policy implication
For example number plausible scheme levying tax transmission congested link network shown significantly reduce price anarchy
These example many case computer scientist using insight economics solve problem
Others include study electronic commerce analysis design complex digital market auction
The flow idea computer science economics traveling direction economist begun apply insight method computer science new old problem
The computer scientist interest economics accompanied explosion research algorithmic issue economic modeling due large part fact economic model entertained computer science often extraordinarily large dimension
In routing example discussed number player equal number network user number action equal number route network
Representing model normal form traditional game theory one explicitly enumerates possibility infeasible
In recent year computer scientist examining new way representing encoding model
Such new encoding little value unless attendant algorithm manipulate efficiently instance performing equilibrium related computation
Although computational complexity certain basic problem remains unresolved great stride made development fast algorithm many economic model
In short appears computational perspective many aspect economic modeling may ready scale
We undertake construction algorithmic manipulation numerical economic model whose complexity greatly exceeds one could contemplated decade ago
Finally also turn analytical mathematical method computer science extremely well suited examining way structure economic model might influence expected outcome model instance way topology routing network might influence congestion experienced equilibrium way connectivity pattern good exchange network might influence variation price distribution wealth shall see shortly way transfer passenger air carrier might influence investment decision improved security
To illustrate computational trend I examine case study drawn work class economic model known interdependent security IDS game nicely capture wide range commonly occurring risk management scenario
Howard Kunreuther Wharton School University Pennsylvania Geoffrey Heal Columbia University introduced notion IDS game meant capture setting decision invest risk mitigation may heavily influenced natural notion risk Interestingly class sufficiently general model problem area diverse infectious disease vaccination corporate compliance computer network security investment research airline baggage screening
It also present nontrivial computational challenge
Let u introduce IDS model another example computer science problem securing shared computer resource
Suppose desktop computer software memory also keep largest important data file hard disk drive shared many user
Your primary security concern thus virus piece malicious software might erase content shared hard drive
Your desktop computer content including email program file download potential point entry malware course desktop machine user hard disk
Now imagine face decision whether download recent update standard desktop security software Norton
This distinct investment decision much monetary cost take time energy perform update
If diligence factor protecting valued hard drive incentive suffer hassle would high
But factor
The safety hard drive dependent diligence user whose desktop machine present potential point compromise since laziness part single user could result breach wipe disk clean forever
Furthermore user may keep important file drive therefore considerably le concern drive safety
Thus incentive invest highly interdependent action player game
In particular many user essentially none currently keeping security software updated diligence would best incremental effect already highly vulnerable disk worth time update security software
At extreme others reliable security update negligence would constitute primary source vulnerability effect disk safety investing virus update
Kunreuther Heal propose model many related problem
Although formal mathematical detail model beyond current scope main feature follows In shared disk example interesting network structure per se sense user interact solely shared resource effect given user user By negligent reduce security disk amount everyone differentially different party
In word network asymmetry All pair party interaction even though specific individual may influence overall outcome differently different behavior
Kunreuther Heal naturally first examined setting asymmetry absent party direct indirect risk
Such model permit efficient computation even creation simple formula possible equilibrium
But realistic setting asymmetry among party abound precluding simple characterization presenting significant computational challenge
It exactly problem interest strength computer science take hold
A practical numerical computational example IDS studied recent work done group
In example player air carrier investment decision pertains amount resource devoted luggage screening explosive catastrophic event midair explosion network structure arises baggage transfer pair carrier
Before describing experiment I provide background
In United States individual air carrier determine procedure investment make baggage screening explosive contraband subject meeting minimum federal requirement
Individual bag thus subjected procedure whichever carrier traveler board beginning trip
If bag transferred one carrier another receiving carrier rescreen according procedure simply accepts implicit validation first carrier
The reason primarily efficiency cost repeated screening
The fact carrier free apply procedure exceed federal requirement witnessed practice El Al Airlines also exception fact screen transferred bag
As shared disk example thus clear interdependent component problem baggage screening
If carrier receives great volume transfer carrier lax security may actually little incentive invest improved security bag screen directly The explosion risk presented transferred bag already high expense marginal improvement direct check security unjustified
Note For simplicity I considering expensive proposition rescreening transferred bag improving security directly checked luggage
Alternatively airline maintain extremely high screening standard le secure carrier main source risk may checked baggage creating incentive improved screening
Kunreuther Heal discus fatal explosion aboard Pan Am flight Lockerbie Scotland viewed deliberate exploitation interdependent risk baggage screening
The network structure case arises fact true pairwise interaction carrier opposed shared disk setting interaction indirect occurred via shared resource
Since pair airline may transfer bag may equal volume strong asymmetry may emerge
Within network transfer airline may find receiving many transfer carrier lax security others may receive transfer primarily responsible party
On global scale one imagine asymmetry might arise political regulatory practice different geographical region demographic factor many source
Such network structure might expected strong influence outcome since asymmetry transfer create asymmetry incentive therefore behavior
In work group conducted first computational simulation study IDS game
This simulation based data set containing record actual civilian commercial flight reservation domestic international made August
Each record contains complete flight itinerary single individual thus document passenger therefore presumably baggage transfer commercial air carrier appearing data set
The data set contained identifying information individual
Furthermore since I describing idealized simulation based limited data I identify specific carrier ensuing discussion
I begin discussing raw data particular count transfer carrier
show visualization transfer count busiest carrier measured total flight leg carrier appearing data
Along horizontal ax carrier arranged order number flight leg rank busiest carrier rank least
At grid cell vertical bar show number transfer one particular carrier another
Thus transfer pair busiest carrier appear far corner diagram transfer pair least busy carrier near corner
Despite simplicity Figure already reveals fair amount interesting structure weighted network transfer major carrier
Perhaps striking property overwhelming fraction transfer occur among handful largest carrier
This visually demonstrated skyscraper far corner dominate landscape transfer
Scientists traveler know hub spoke system airport naturally lead distribution flight small number major airport serve many time volume average airport
Here witnessing similar phenomenon across air carrier rather airport The major carrier account almost volume well almost transfer
This yet another example staggering variety social economic technological demonstrated recent year property one kind another
Beyond descriptive observation le known property influence outcome
In moment see profound effect imbalanced structure carrier transfer network outcome predicted IDS simulation simple model suggest structure lead rather directly policy suggestion
In order perform simulation empirical number transfer data set carrier A carrier B used set parameter IDS model represents probability transfer A B
The numerical IDS model result fall known class computation equilibrium performed efficiently
However proof intractability concerned specific model general class
We thus performed simulation numerical model carrier gradually adapts investment behavior response current payoff investment depends strongly current investment decision network neighbor manner informally described
See sidebar page detailed explanation model
The basic question simulation whether converges predicted equilibrium outcome
There priori reason must since independent adaptation carrier could instance result cyclical investment behavior
This question easily answered The simulation quickly converges equilibrium many variant examined
This demonstration common phenomenon computer science empirical effectiveness heuristic specific instance problem may computationally difficult general
Further worth noting particular heuristic gradual adaptation investment starting realistic equilibrium outcome identifies final state suggests dynamic path carrier might actually arrive equilibrium starting natural initial condition
The interesting question turn property predicted equilibrium
And like property might
show result simulation described
The figure show grid plot one busiest according overall flight traffic data set carrier
The plot upper left corner corresponds busiest carrier plot lower right corner corresponds busiest
The x axis plot corresponds time unit simulation step axis show level investment investment hypothetical maximum investment corresponding carrier adapts simulation
As noted carrier start zero investment
Examining detail Figure find within approximately step simulation population carrier converged equilibrium adaptation taking place carrier last converge
From viewpoint societal benefit outcome would prefer emerge carrier fully invest improved screening
Instead carrier converge mixture invest fully invest nothing
In general mixture obeys ordering traffic volume The le busy carrier tend converge full investment whereas larger carrier never move initial position investment
This due fact according numerical model larger carrier generally face large amount indirect transfer risk thus incentive improve screening procedure
Smaller carrier better control fate improved screening since fewer transferred bag
There exception simple ordering
For instance carrier rank invest despite fact carrier similar volume choose invest
These exception due specific transfer parameter carrier
The carrier rank shown converge full investment
Figure thus show price anarchy numerical IDS baggage screening model quite high The outcome obtained letting carrier behave independently selfishly far desired societal optimum full investment
The fact carrier converge investment little consolation given fact include largest carrier account overwhelming volume flight
The model thus predicts insecure screening system arise interdependent risk
Even interesting baseline prediction policy implication derived manipulation model
One way achieving desired outcome full investment carrier would federal government subsidize carrier improved security screening
A natural economic question whether effect accomplished minimal centralized intervention subsidization
show result one thought experiment
The format figure identical Figure one small important detail simulation changed
In simulation depicted Figure two largest carrier investment level fixed maximum adapted value simulation
In word effectively running experiment subsidized two largest carrier
The predicted effect limited subsidization quite dramatic
Most notably remaining carrier evolve desired equilibrium full investment
In word relatively minor subsidization two carrier created economic incentive carrier invest improved security
This instance tipping phenomenon first identified Thomas Schelling recently popularized Malcolm Gladwell case behavioral change small collection individual cause massive shift overall population behavior
Figure also nicely demonstrates cascading behavior among carrier
The subsidization two largest carrier immediately cause carrier begin investing start simulation
Rather carrier mainly larger one begin invest sufficient fraction population invested enough make direct risk primary transfer risk secondary
Indeed seventh largest carrier economic incentive invest toward end simulation last converge
This cascading effect tipping phenomenon occurs sequentially distinct order investment present original simulation much pronounced
Of course two largest carrier form one tipping set
There may collection carrier whose coerced investment either subsidization mean cause others follow
Depending detailed economic assumption make investment question tipping set may le expensive implement others
Natural policy question include asking practical mean inducing full investment model facilitate exploration large number alternative answer
The model also predict necessary condition tipping
In show result simulation largest carrier subsidized
Although salutary effect stimulating investment number carrier carrier would otherwise invested sufficient cause entire population invest
The price anarchy remains high largest carrier investing
As extreme negative example found subsidizing two largest carrier still insufficient induce two largest invest anything highly interdependent transfer risk two precludes one investing without
The IDS case study examined one example network structure economic model computational issue policy interact interesting potentially powerful fashion
Others beginning emerge dialogue computer scientist economist heat
For instance group also examining network version classical exchange model mathematical economics studied Kenneth Arrow Gerard Debreu
In original model consumer endowment commodity good utility function describing preferred good exchange take place consumer trade endowment preferred good
In variant studied also underlying network structure defining allowable trade Consumers allowed engage trade immediate neighbor network
The introduction natural restriction model radically alters basic property price equilibrium
The good vary price across economy due entirely network asymmetry individual consumer may relatively economically advantaged disadvantaged detail position overall network
In addition area seen great stride efficient algorithm equilibrium computation also one highlight insight computer science bring relationship structure outcome
For example turn structural property network known computer science expansion offer characterization network variation price great deal variation
Interestingly expansion property also closely related theory random walk network
The intuition randomly wandering around network region one become stuck long period region economic imbalance price variation low wealth emerge
Thus direct relationship structural economic notion isolation
We also performed numerical experiment similar model derived United Nations foreign exchange data
Such experiment demonstrate economic power derived purely nation position idealized network structure extracted data
The model algorithm support predictive manipulation
For instance original network extracted United States commanded highest price equilibrium wide margin
When network modified model truly unified frictionless European Union EU instead became predicted economic superpower
Looking forward research dialogue computer science economics community perhaps easy part since largely share common mathematical language
More difficult convincing policymakers dialogue make peripheral contribution work
For occur scientist need pick application carefully work hard understand constraint policymakers arena
This sociological step scientist wade often messy water method must prove useful despite political budgetary constraint likely easy
But seems time attempt arrived since computational predictive analytical tool considerably ambitious economic model quickly falling place
As I discussed within computer science influence economic model already beginning inform policy
This particularly favorable domain since many policy issue technology core scientist often close even individual
Similarly promising area include epidemiology transportation latter including topic application IDS baggage screening
That case study exemplifies opportunity challenge
It provides compelling greatly oversimplified evidence potential policy implication rich model
The missing specific plausible security screening investment metric carrier direct risk based demographic history many filled model taken seriously
But regardless domain required start scientist policymaker ready work together modern unusual manner

When one formalizes IDS baggage screening problem result model payoff game determined following parameter I
For carrier A numerical parameter D A quantifying level direct risk A intuitively probability particular carrier directly check bag containing explosive onto flight
Obviously parameter might vary carrier carrier depending among thing ambient level risk presented demographic customer base geographic region carrier
II
For pair carrier A B numerical paramater T A B quantifying indirect risk A face due transferred bag B intuitively probability bag transferred flight B flight A contains explosive device
This parameter might vary different carrier pair depending among thing volume transfer B A direct risk III
Parameters possibly varying carrier toticated carrier quantifying required investment I A improved screening technology procedure cost E A explosion
The resulting multiparty game described payoff function carrier A depend E A I A D A parameter T A B carrier B
For numerical experiment describe empirical number transfer data set carrier B carrier A used set parameter T A B
Note despite large number record data set actually rather small compared number pair carrier thus leading many transfer count zero
However simulation result appear robust even standard form smoothing applied sparse estimate
Although data set contains detailed empirical evidence intracarrier transfer provides guidance setting IDS model parameter direct risk investment explosion cost
These thus set common default value simulation
In future work could clearly replaced either human estimate variety source data
For instance direct risk could derived statistic regarding security breach individual carrier airport receive greatest volume
Let u briefly delve computational challenge presented model
The sheer number parameter dominated category II
There one parameter per pair carrier number parameter category grows roughly square number carrier
For instance model carrier number parameter model already exceeds
We thus interested algorithmically manipulating rather model
From theoretical standpoint computationalnews model mixed interestingrameter way
If consider completely general case given parameter category I II III possible prove formally worst case may certain equilibrium computationally intractable find
On hand various restriction assumption parameter particularly transferdirect parameter category II allow one develop sophisticated algorithm efficiently compute possible outcome
Such mixed theproved ambitious variant problem computationally infeasible nontrivial algorithm tackle nontrivial special often sign interesting problem computer science
Of course real world also typically lie somewhere provably solvable worst case
And one often find simple natural heuristic surprisingly effective yield valuable insight
In particular simulation describe heuristic known gradient descent employed
More precisely according IDS model numerical payoff carrier A receive investment improved screening depends current investment carrier weighted probability transferring passenger carrier A
This payoff could either positive incentive increased investment negative disincentive increased investment
In simulation carrier A simply incrementally adjusts current investment according incentive signal carrier likewise
All carrier begin investment assume maximum possible investment
Such gradient approach challenging computational problem common science
There many possible natural variant simulation imagined

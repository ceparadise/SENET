refers informal paradigm context describes change communication mechanism function communication system particular service component
In transition communication mechanism within system replaced functionally comparable mechanism aim ensure highest possible quality captured
Transitions enable communication system adapt changing condition runtime
This change condition example rapid increase load certain service may caused large gathering people mobile device
A transition often impact multiple mechanism different communication layer
Mechanisms given conceptual element networked communication system linked specific functional unit example service protocol component
In case mechanism also comprise entire protocol
For example transmission layer LTE regarded mechanism
Following definition exist numerous communication mechanism partly equivalent basic functionality local wireless network UMTS broadband wireless connection
For example LTE equivalent basic functionality technologically significantly different design operation
Mechanisms affected transition often component protocol service
For example case video use different video data encoding carried depending available data transmission rate
These change controlled implemented transition A research example video adaptation service support mobile video application
Through analyzing current process communication system possible determine transition need executed communication layer order meet quality requirement
In order communication system adapt respective framework condition architectural approach adaptive system used MAPE cycle
This central concept used determine state communication system analyze monitoring data plan execute necessary transition
A central goal user consciously perceive transition running application functionality used service perceived smooth fluid
The study new fundamental design method model technique enable automated coordinated transition functionally similar mechanism within communication system main goal collaborative research center funded German research foundation DFG
The DFG collaborative research center MAKI Adaptation future Internet focus research question following area Fundamental research transition method ii Techniques adapting communication system basis achieved targeted quality iii specific exemplary transition communication system regarded different technical perspective

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I currently hold BA Middle Eastern History pretty good fit last job Army
I getting ready move civillian world computer always hobby I like look turning career
My question Should I look getting second undergrad would programming education certificate enough get foot door school later
Are online certificate respected enough especially addition traditional degree
I basically want know set sight order get going software development
Getting additional qualification seems necessary kind make sense getting started
I think going depend vastly kind position want headed deep rabbit hole wish go
The one thing I would say ought focus fundamental No matter kind work end programming business process pursuing PhD getting fundamental straight pay dividend
Courses algorithm software engineering computer architecture give different view work matter
A CS undergraduate degree would good choice especially grad study want go
I understand vary quality though something bear mind
I teach aimed people like earned bachelor degree field CS want transition CS order go software engineering although also teaching
While quick cheap program usually better choice second bachelor degree since student take anything CS related math course many peer similar position
Depending aiming
working tech
company versus professor may enough qualification already
The programming industry still industry extremely forgiving qualification necessary work
This likely due age industry nature
If feel need traditional preparation site like others provide Massively Open Online Courses MOOC great place get CS course take Intro course advanced one free paid certificate also available
Also working real open source project one place start looking align interest skill proved capable great resume item
From written I think well spending time finding company need skill already hobbyist likely know lest one language pretty well practicing skill

As question say
I wondering transition system program graph two different thing
Thank
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
You provide particular resource neither transition system program graph
My answer based book Principles Model Checking Christel Baier Katoen The MIT Press
For completeness I first present definition transition system program graph book

In program described designed remember preceding event user interaction remembered information called system
The set state system occupy known
In state space often system internal behaviour interaction environment consists separately occurring individual action event accepting input producing output may may cause system change state
Examples system circuit component
The output digital circuit computer program time completely determined current input state
circuit divided two type whose output dependent present input signal whose output function current input past history input
In sequential logic information past input stored electronic memory element
The stored content memory element given point time collectively referred circuit contains information past circuit access
Since two possible state finite number memory element digital circuit certain finite number possible state
If number binary memory element circuit maximum number state circuit
Similarly computer program store data represent storage location computer
The content memory location given point program execution called program
way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number
It add one subtracts one number get number new channel adjusts TV receive channel
This new number stored
Similarly television also store number control level produced speaker
Pressing volume volume button increment decrement number setting new level volume
Both number part TV state
They stored preserve information TV turned turned TV return previous station volume level

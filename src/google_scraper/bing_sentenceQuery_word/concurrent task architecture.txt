form several executed overlapping time one completing next start
This property may individual separate execution point thread control computation process
A one computation advance without waiting computation complete
As concurrent computing form namely overall computation subcomputations may executed concurrently
Pioneers field concurrent computing include
The concept concurrent computing frequently confused related distinct concept although described multiple process executing
In parallel computing execution occurs physical instant example separate machine goal speeding computing impossible single processor one computation occur instant single clock cycle
By contrast concurrent computing consists process overlapping execution need happen instant
The goal model process outside world happen concurrently multiple client accessing server time
Structuring software system composed multiple concurrent communicating part useful tackling complexity regardless whether part executed parallel
For example concurrent process executed one core interleaving execution step process via slice one process run time complete time slice another process begin resume later original process resumed
In way multiple process execution single instant one process executed instant
Concurrent computation executed parallel example assigning process separate processor processor core computation across network
In general however language tool technique parallel programming might suitable concurrent programming vice versa
The exact timing task concurrent system executed depend task need always executed concurrently
For example given two task The word sequential used antonym concurrent parallel explicitly distinguished used opposing pair
A schedule task execute one time serially parallelism without interleaving sequentially concurrency task begin prior task end called
A set task scheduled serially simplifies
The main challenge designing concurrent program ensuring correct sequencing interaction communication different computational execution coordinating access resource shared among execution
Potential problem include
For example consider following algorithm make withdrawal checking account represented shared resource Suppose two concurrent make call
If line operation executes line operation find evaluates execution proceed subtracting withdrawal amount
However since process perform withdrawal total amount withdrawn end original balance
These sort problem shared resource need use
Because concurrent system rely use shared resource including communication medium concurrent computing general need use form somewhere implementation mediate access resource
Unfortunately many solution exist problem conflict one resource many solution concurrency problem one resource involved
Concurrent computing following advantage There several model concurrent computing used understand analyze concurrent system
These model include A number different method used implement concurrent program implementing computational execution implementing computational process set within single operating system process
In concurrent computing system communication concurrent component hidden programmer using others must handled explicitly
Explicit communication divided two class Shared memory message passing concurrency different performance characteristic
Typically although always memory overhead task switching overhead lower message passing system overhead message passing greater procedure call
These difference often overwhelmed performance factor
Concurrent computing developed earlier work railroad early century term date period semaphore
These arose address question handle multiple train railroad system avoiding collision maximizing efficiency handle multiple transmission given set wire improving efficiency via
The academic study concurrent algorithm started credited first paper field identifying solving
Concurrency pervasive computing occurring hardware single chip worldwide network
Examples follow
At programming language level At operating system level At network level networked system generally concurrent nature consist separate device
programming language use language construct
These construct may involve support including
Such language sometimes described Concurrency Oriented Languages Concurrency Oriented Programming Languages COPL
Today commonly used programming language specific construct concurrency
Both language fundamentally use concurrency model locking provided although model implemented top underlying model
Of language use concurrency model probably widely used industry present
Many concurrent programming language developed research language
rather language production use
However language seen industrial use various time last year
Languages concurrency play important role include Many language provide support concurrency form library level roughly comparable list

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
When looking concurrent programming two term commonly used
concurrent parallel
And programming language specifically claim support parallel programming
Does mean parallel concurrent programming actually different
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Distinguish parallelism using extra computational unit work per unit time concurrency managing access shared resource
Teach parallelism easier help establish sequential mindset
From A Introduction Parallelism Concurrency Dan Grossman version November Conurrency parallelism differ problem solve cause independent
Executing two task mean individual step task executed interleaved fashion
If disregard parallelism assume one statement executed point time priori guarantee task get execute next step
This useful regard Some main challenge Executing two task mean statement executed
This mainly useful Key challenge include See also distinguishing parallel distributed computing
In addition Nish answer let recommend Simon Marlow book
They answer first question Haskell perspective could better suited theoretically inclined reader Haskell purely functional lazy programming language much closer Mathematics language
Quoting In many field word parallel concurrent synonym programming used describe fundamentally different concept
A parallel program one us multiplicity computational hardware
multiple processor core order perform computation quickly
Different part computation delegated different processor execute time parallel result may delivered earlier computation performed sequentially
In contrast concurrency technique multiple thread control
Notionally thread control execute time user see effect interleaved
Whether actually execute time implementation detail concurrent program execute single processor interleaved execution multiple physical processor
I recommend reading rest tutorial let quote remainder section connects programming paradigm quantitative qualitative characteristic program efficiency modularity determinism
While parallel programming concerned efficiency concurrent programming concerned structuring program need interact multiple independent external agent example user database server external client
Concurrency allows program modular thread interacts user distinct thread talk database
In absence concurrency program written event loop callback indeed event loop callback often used even concurrency available many language concurrency either expensive difficult use
The notion thread control make sense purely functional program effect observe evaluation order irrelevant
So concurrency structuring technique effectful code Haskell mean code IO monad
A related distinction deterministic nondeterministic programming model
A deterministic programming model one program give one result whereas nondeterministic programming model admits program may different result depending aspect execution
Concurrent programming model necessarily nondeterministic must interact external agent cause event unpredictable time
Nondeterminism notable drawback however program become signifficantly harder test reason
For parallel programming would like use deterministic programming model possible
Since goal arrive answer quickly would rather make program harder debug process
Deterministic parallel programming best world testing debugging reasoning performed sequential program program run faster processor added
Indeed computer processor implement deterministic parallelism form pipelining multiple execution unit
While possible parallel programming using concurrency often poor choice concurrency sacriffices determinism
In Haskell parallel programming model deterministic
However important note deterministic programming model sufficient express kind parallel algorithm algorithm depend internal nondeterminism particularly problem involve searching solution space
In Haskell class algorithm expressible using concurrency

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I come electronics background
I know three type implementation multithreading see issue instruction different thread every cycle
switch issue instruction another thread current executing thread cause long latency event like page fault etc
issue multiple instruction multiple thread one cycle
The processor must superscalar
Does mean SMT extension multithreading multithreading suitable single core processor
What exact difference SMT approach
Hennessy Patterson Computer Architecture A Quantitative Approach use term multithreading refer running one thread single core
Their distinction simultaneous involves different approach thread share issue logic logic move instruction decode pipeline stage execute pipeline stage
In multithreading issue stage issue instruction one thread many cycle dozen hundred switch issuing another thread first thread get cache miss operation
In multithreading issue stage issue instruction different thread cycle instruction issued together cycle must come thread
In simultaneous multithreading issue stage issue instruction different thread cycle
The restriction lifted instruction issued together cycle must come thread
The distinction multithreading simultaneous multithreading matter machine simultaneously issue two instruction
multithreading multithreading two approach implemented even processor
The idea different thread single core
multithreading switch thread every often multithreading transfer control executing thread waiting operation resolve
Simultaneous multithreading implemented multicore system executes different thread different core different processing unit core superscalarity
Hopefully I explained concept clearly enough answer question
A physical processor made number different resource including architecture state general purpose CPU register interrupt controller register cache bus execution unit branch prediction logic
However order define thread architecture state required
A logical processor thus created duplicating architecture space
The execution resource shared among different logical processor

In refers one two distinct related concept synchronization synchronization
refers idea multiple process join certain point order reach agreement commit certain sequence action
refers idea keeping multiple copy dataset coherence one another maintain
Process synchronization primitive commonly used implement data synchronization
The need synchronization arise merely system kind concurrent process even single processor system
Mentioned main need synchronization When job arrives fork point split N serviced n task
After serviced wait done processing
Then joined leave system
Thus parallel programming require synchronization parallel process wait several process occur
In relationship consumer process dependent producer process till necessary data produced
When multiple process dependent resource need access time operating system need ensure one processor access given point reduces concurrency
Thread synchronization defined mechanism ensures two concurrent simultaneously execute particular program segment known
Processes access critical section controlled using synchronization technique
When one thread start executing serialized segment program thread wait first thread finish
If proper synchronization technique applied may cause value variable may unpredictable vary depending timing process thread
For example suppose three process namely
All three concurrently executing need share common resource critical section shown Figure
Synchronization used avoid conflict accessing shared resource
Hence Process try access resource assigned one process time
If assigned Process process Process need wait Process free resource shown Figure
Another synchronization requirement need considered order particular process thread executed
For example board plane buy ticket
Similarly check without validating credential user name password
In way ATM provide service provide correct PIN
Other mutual exclusion synchronization also deal following One challenge exascale algorithm design minimize reduce synchronization
Synchronization take time computation especially distributed computing
Reducing synchronization drew attention computer scientist decade
Whereas becomes increasingly significant problem recently gap improvement computing latency increase
Experiments shown global communication due synchronization distributed computer take dominated share sparse iterative solver
This problem receiving increasing attention emergence new benchmark metric High Performance Conjugate Gradient HPCG ranking top supercomputer
The following classic problem synchronization These problem used test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme primitive
Many system provide hardware support code
A single processor could disable executing currently running code without inefficient system
The key ability require implement synchronization multiprocessor set hardware primitive ability atomically read modify memory location
Without capability cost building basic synchronization primitive high increase processor count increase
There number alternative formulation basic hardware primitive provide ability atomically read modify location together way tell read write performed atomically
These hardware primitive basic building block used build wide variety synchronization operation including thing
In general architect expect user employ basic hardware primitive instead expect primitive used system programmer build synchronization library process often complex tricky
Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instruction either memory word content two memory word
In prevent thread interference memory consistency error block code wrapped section
This force thread acquire said lock object execute block
The lock automatically released thread leaf block enter waiting state within block
Any variable update made thread synchronized block become visible thread whenever thread similarly acquires lock
In addition mutual exclusion memory consistency Java block enable signaling sending event thread acquired lock execute code block waiting lock within block
This mean Java synchronized section combine functionality mutexes event
Such primitive known
Any object fine used Java
The declaring object implicitly implied lock object whole method marked
The synchronization primitive
Synchronization designed cooperative demanding every thread process follow synchronization mechanism accessing protected resource critical section consistent result
In locking signaling lightweight synchronization type spinwait interlocked operation mechanism related synchronization
Another effective way implementing synchronization using spinlocks
Before accessing shared resource piece code every processor check flag
If flag reset processor set flag continues executing thread
But flag set locked thread would keep spinning loop keep checking flag set
But spinlocks effective flag reset lower cycle otherwise lead performance issue waste many processor cycle waiting
Barriers simple implement provide good responsiveness
They based concept implementing wait cycle provide synchronization
Consider three thread running simultaneously starting barrier
After time reach barrier still wait thread reach correct data
Once thread reach barrier start
After time thread reach wait thread correct data
Thus barrier synchronization multiple thread always thread end waiting thread example thread keep waiting thread
This result severe degradation process performance
The barrier synchronization wait function thread represented Wbarrier f Tbarrier Rthread Where Wbarrier wait time thread Tbarrier number thread arrived Rthread arrival rate thread
Experiments show total execution time spent waiting slower thread
Semaphores signalling mechanism allow one access section
A Semaphore flag certain fixed value associated time thread wish access section decrement flag
Similarly thread leaf section flag incremented
If flag zero thread access section get blocked chooses wait
Some semaphore would allow one thread process code section
Such Semaphores called binary semaphore similar Mutex
Here value semaphore thread allowed access value access denied
Synchronization originally concept whereby lock could obtained object
Its primary usage database
There two type file
lock may obtained many process thread
lock exclusive may used single time
Although lock derived file database data also shared memory process thread
Sometimes one object file locked time
If locked simultaneously overlap causing deadlock exception
exclusive lock thread based rely processor instruction
An abstract mathematical foundation synchronization primitive given
There also many theoretical device built top history monoid
Following synchronization example respect different platform
provides provides Enabling disabling kernel preemption replaced spinlocks uniprocessor system
Prior kernel version disabled interrupt implement short critical section
Since version later Linux fully preemptive
provides provides A distinctly different related concept
This refers need keep multiple copy set data coherent one another maintain Figure
For example database replication used keep multiple copy data synchronized database server store data different location
Examples include Some challenge user may face data synchronization When start something data usually simple format
It varies time organization grows evolves result building simple interface two application source target also need transform data passing target application
extraction transformation loading tool helpful stage managing data format complexity
This era system
Customers want see current status order current status parcel real time parcel current balance account etc
This show need system updated well enable smooth manufacturing process ordering material enterprise running stock synchronizing customer order manufacturing process etc
From real life exist many example processing give successful competitive advantage
There fixed rule policy enforce data security
It may vary depending system using
Even though security maintained correctly source system capture data security information access privilege must enforced target system well prevent potential misuse information
This serious issue particularly come handling secret confidential personal information
So sensitivity confidentiality data transfer information must encrypted
Data quality another serious constraint
For better management maintain good quality data common practice store data one location share different people different system application different location
It help preventing inconsistency data
There five different phase involved data synchronization process Each step critical
In case large amount data synchronization process need carefully planned executed avoid negative impact performance

About site A journal thought thing life Collection article I published Presentations I delivered recently Software I written My link collection My picture collection featuring cute little chihuahua Pico Quick introduction internals people scared word like
In simplified form git object storage DAG object handful different type object
They stored compressed identified hash incidentally content file represent representation git
The simplest object bunch byte
This often file symlink pretty much anything else
The object point determines semantics
Directories represented object
They refer content file filename access mode etc stored subdirectory
When node point another node DAG node exist without
Nodes nothing point garbage collected rescued much like filesystem inodes filename pointing
A refers represents state file time commit
It also refers parent
More one parent mean commit merge parent mean initial commit interestingly one initial commit usually mean two separate project merged
The body object commit message
References head branch like note slapped node DAG
Where DAG get added existing node mutated moved around freely
They get stored history directly transferred repository
They act sort bookmark I working
add node DAG move note current branch new node
The ref special actually point another ref
It pointer currently active branch
Normal ref actually namespace often skip part
Remote reference note different color
The difference normal different namespace fact remote ref essentially controlled remote server
update
A node DAG note yet another color
A point includes optional message GPG signature
The fast way access tag lost recovered DAG
The node DAG moved repository repository stored effective form pack unused node garbage collected
But end repository always DAG
So armed knowledge store version history visualize thing like merges differ tool try manage history linear change per branch
This simplest repository
We remote repository one commit
Here ed remote received one new commit remote merged yet
The situation
As merge new commits local branch thing happened moving note changing file working directory respectively
One local later
We new local commit new remote commit
Clearly merge needed
Results
Because new local commits actual new node created DAG
Note two parent Here tree look commits branch another merge
See stitching pattern emerge
The DAG record exactly history action taken
The stitching pattern somewhat tedious read
If yet published branch clearly communicated others base work alternative
You branch instead merging commit replaced another commit different parent branch moved
Your old commit remain DAG garbage collected
Ignore know way screwed totally
If extra pointing old commit remain pointing keep old commit alive indefinitely
That fairly confusing though
Do rebase branch others created new commits top
It possible recover hard extra work needed frustrating
The situation garbage collecting ignoring unreachable commit creating new commit top branch
also know rebase multiple commits one command
That end brief intro people intimidated computer science
Hope helped

Someone well versed git could help understand difference repo branch
I recently introduced git bit hard time understand
I told clone remote repo
foo local box
Then create local branch
Work file branch remote server
bitbucket
After set eye review branch say Then get merged development master branch
Then role repository play picture
To operation I ran branch A whole project
folder file clone computer
A repository
A repository contains several branch multiple version repository multiple feature developed parallel
The purpose versioning code work multiple aspect project time evolving different
Git us expression working tree representing workbench alongside branch
Full imagery
Related If want know difference local remote branch check
Concerning way dealing branch Clone remote repo
foo local box
Then create local branch
Work file branch remote server This nice clean way work git
I suggest always proceed like Then create branch local master work commit change push remote Then happy merge
In Git repository refers entire project
Within single Git repository least one
You use create new branch within repository track change change code base pertain particular new feature
Anytime clone repository creating copy project repository local machine
In addition also able new change developer pushed public repository learn
A repository contains information project including history change
Each change entered repository form commit
In order show difference branch repository I describe process mentioned point along way branch repository used
This intended git tutorial example talk branch repos
Typically exists remote repository user get copy submit change
No actual development work done directly remote repo
A user get first copy remote repository cloning
This create local repository user machine
The local repo complete copy remote repo
A branch simply pointer one commits repository
In simplest case default branch called master master point recent commit
Each commit identified number hash repo moment
For example case master might point commit A developer clone remote repo checkout branch master
Then create checkout development branch

At point branch master point commit
Make change file
Commit change local copy branch
Now local repository branch point newer commit master
Push branch remote repo reviewed
The used first time branch pushed remote tell git want track branch
Other developer already cloned remote repo get branch remote repository performing pull
After review tell ok merge branch copy master local repo push master
But wait
What developer already pushed change remote master
You checkout master local repo Then pull master remote You new change someone else made master point last commit
Now merge dev branch local copy master If one changed master harm done
The merge add commits master branch
Resolve conflict created push master back remote

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

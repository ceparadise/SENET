Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What difference three especially context User manual User guide User instruction There considerable overlap among three extent interchangeable
They coupled together term
In addition number similar term like
refers specifically reference document provides detailed information operation maintenance product
Manufacturers often provide official manual product provide assistance owner user car example usually come machinery official documentation Unix program
generic term
Whereas implies written document one could booklet video game large book complex product car guide card another medium altogether video
It may detailed reference also indicate simple overview instruction small subset feature
Because manual connotation dense boring text manufacturer technical writer prefer label guide would traditionally called manual
generic term may synonymous guidance perform specific task function
A manual guide include many set instruction
Used alone however instruction refer simplest explanatory
The presence phrase cited suggests electronic software product case I would say three phrase cited synonymous
For example Apple label website Manuals yet document themeselves
I think would rare supplied three different reference labeled user manual user guide user instruction
In case I would expect manual main canonical reference guide short overview feature instruction rudimentary introduction use product question
Agreeing Choster I believe official comprehensive reference operation maintenance product device
Manuals may also provide conceptual information design theory
Some manual comprehensive enough include information would otherwise found separate guide instruction usage scenario diagnostic procedure installation instruction etc
A coach user use product effectively efficiently typically providing application example usage scenario
Some marketing professional prefer using term guide instead manual without regard distinction guide sound helpful easier read
simply procedure presumably procedure accomplishing specific task
The instruction contained manual guide standalone document instruction sheet assembling furniture replacing battery
Agreeing chessmath choster I like add cent
may refer subject matter
Project Team Test System Administrative Marketing Miscellaneous type
For every subject matter certain instruction using
user guide reference manual need created packaging along certain product service
IMHO two type documentation From onwards start building expanding certain documentation requirement specific required law product service
Manual related operate something usually electronic device
The word come Latin manus hand context mean operate something hand
User guide give u idea introducing device giving aspect capacity tour know delightful task device
User instruction related give instruction given task follow strictly instruction performance well activity
Manual focus Object device How operate
Guide focus capacity device
Instruction focus leading determined task device
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

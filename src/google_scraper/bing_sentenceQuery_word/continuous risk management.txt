IT risk management considered component wider system
The establishment maintenance continuous update ISMS provide strong indication company using systematic approach identification assessment management information security risk
Different methodology proposed manage IT risk divided process step
According framework encompasses negative impact operation service delivery bring destruction reduction value organization also benefit enabling risk associated missing opportunity use technology enable enhance business IT project management aspect like overspending late delivery adverse business impact
Because strictly tied uncertainty applied manage risk science
rationally making choice uncertainty
Generally speaking product likelihood time Risk Likelihood Impact
The measure IT risk determined product threat vulnerability value A current Risk management framework IT Risk would TIK framework The Review Manual produced ISACA international professional association focused IT Governance provides following definition risk management There two thing definition may need clarification
First risk management ongoing iterative
It must repeated indefinitely
The business environment constantly changing new emerge every day
Second choice used manage risk must strike balance productivity cost effectiveness countermeasure value informational asset protected

The head organizational unit must ensure organization capability needed accomplish mission
These mission owner must determine security capability IT system must provide desired level mission support face real world
Most organization tight budget IT security therefore IT security spending must reviewed thoroughly management decision
A risk management methodology used effectively help management identify appropriate providing security capability
Risk management IT world quite complex multi faced activity lot relation complex activity
The picture right show relationship different related term
The American defines risk management IT field Some organization many others comprehensive ERM place
The four objective category addressed according COSO According framework IT risk transversal four category
The IT risk managed framework Enterprise risk management Risk sensitivity whole enterprise guide IT risk management process
ERM provide context business objective IT risk management The term mean organized set principle rule drive action particular field knowledge
A methodology describe specific method nevertheless specify several process need followed
These process constitute generic framework
They may broken may combined sequence may change
However risk management exercise must carry process one form another The following table compare process foreseen three leading standard
The framework recent
The Risk IT compare Risk IT ISO
The overall comparison illustrated following table
process includes In general element described ISO process included Risk IT however structured named differently
Due probabilistic nature need cost benefit analysis IT risk managed following process according SP divided following step Effective risk management must totally integrated
Information conducted application computer installation network system development undertaken using structured methodology
This step first step framework
Most elementary activity foreseen first sub process Risk assessment according SP
This step implies acquisition relevant information organization determination basic criterion purpose scope boundary risk management activity organization charge risk management activity
The purpose usually compliance legal requirement provide evidence due diligence supporting certified
The scope incident reporting plan
Another area application certification product
Criteria include risk evaluation risk acceptance impact evaluation criterion
These conditioned Establishing scope boundary organization studied mission value structure strategy location cultural environment
The constraint budgetary cultural political technical organization collected documented guide next step
The set organization charge risk management foreseen partially fulfilling requirement provide resource needed establish implement operate monitor review maintain improve ISMS
The main role inside organization Risk Management recurrent activity deal analysis planning implementation control monitoring implemented measurement enforced security policy
On contrary Risk Assessment executed discrete time point
year demand etc
performance next assessment provides temporary view assessed risk parameterizing entire Risk Management process
This view relationship Risk Management Risk Assessment depicted figure adopted OCTAVE
Risk assessment often conducted one iteration first assessment identify high risk iteration detailed analysis major risk risk
According risk assessment IT field Risk assessment receives input output previous step output list assessed risk prioritized according risk evaluation criterion
The process divided following step The following table compare ISO process framework process The Code practice information security management recommends following examined risk assessment Risk identification state could cause potential loss following identified The output sub process made There two method risk assessment information security field
Purely quantitative risk assessment mathematical calculation based security metric system application
For taking consideration different SLE determined
Then considering probability occurrence given period basis example annual rate occurrence ARO determined product ARO X SLE
It important point value considered involved asset value directly affected resource
For example consider risk scenario threat consider value data related asset contained computer reputation liability company asset deriving lost availability confidentiality data could involved
It easy understand data reputation liability worth much physical resource risk laptop hardware example
Intangible asset value huge easy evaluate consideration pure quantitative approach
Qualitative risk assessment three five step evaluation Very High Low performed organization requires risk assessment performed relatively short time meet small budget significant quantity relevant data available person performing assessment sophisticated mathematical financial risk assessment expertise required
Qualitative risk assessment performed shorter period time le data
Qualitative risk assessment typically performed interview sample personnel relevant group within organization charged security asset assessed
Qualitative risk assessment descriptive versus measurable
Usually qualitative classification done followed quantitative evaluation highest risk compared cost security measure
Risk estimation input output risk analysis split following step The output list risk value level assigned
It documented
Risks arising security threat adversary attack may particularly difficult estimate
This difficulty made worse least IT system connected Internet adversary intent capability may attack physical closeness access necessary
Some initial model proposed problem
During risk estimation generally three value given asset one loss one property Integrity
The risk evaluation process receives input output risk analysis process
It compare risk level risk acceptance criterion prioritise risk list risk treatment indication
To determine likelihood future adverse event IT system must conjunction potential place IT system
refers magnitude harm could caused threat exercise vulnerability
The level impact governed potential mission impact produce relative value IT asset resource affected criticality sensitivity IT system component data
The methodology encompasses nine primary step Risk mitigation second process according SP third according ISO risk management involves prioritizing evaluating implementing appropriate control recommended risk assessment process
Because elimination risk usually impractical close impossible responsibility senior management functional business manager use approach implement appropriate control decrease mission risk acceptable level minimal adverse organization resource mission
The risk treatment process aim selecting security measure risk produce risk treatment plan output process residual risk subject acceptance management
There list select appropriate security measure single organization choose appropriate one according business strategy constraint environment circumstance
The choice rational documented
The importance accepting risk costly reduce high led fact risk acceptance considered separate process
Risk transfer apply risk high easy reduce significantly likelihood mean security control premium compared mitigation cost eventually evaluating mixed strategy partially treat risk
Another option outsource risk somebody efficient manage risk
Risk avoidance describe action way conducting business changed avoid risk occurrence
For example choice storing sensitive information customer avoidance risk customer data stolen
The
risk remaining risk treatment decision taken estimated ensure sufficient protection achieved
If residual risk unacceptable risk treatment process iterated
Risk mitigation systematic methodology used senior management reduce mission risk
Risk mitigation achieved following risk mitigation option Address greatest risk strive sufficient risk mitigation lowest cost minimal impact mission capability suggestion contained Risk communication horizontal process interacts bidirectionally process risk management
Its purpose establish common understanding aspect risk among organization stakeholder
Establishing common understanding important since influence decision taken
The Risk Reduction Overview method specifically designed process
It present comprehensible overview coherence risk measure residual risk achieve common understanding
Risk management ongoing never ending process
Within process implemented security measure regularly monitored reviewed ensure work planned change environment rendered ineffective
Business requirement vulnerability threat change time
Regular audit scheduled conducted independent party
somebody control responsible implementation daily management
Security control validated
Technical control possible complex system tested verified
The hardest part validate people knowledge procedural control effectiveness real application daily business security procedure
internal external instrument verifying status security control
organizational procedural control aim evaluating security
The IT system organization evolving quite rapidly
Risk management cope change change authorization risk evaluation affected system process periodically review risk mitigation action
Monitoring system event according security monitoring strategy incident response plan security validation metric fundamental activity assure optimal level security obtained
It important monitor new vulnerability apply procedural technical security control like regularly evaluate kind control deal
The attitude involved people follow seminar sector factor assure state art organization IT risk management practice
Effective risk management must totally integrated
An IT system SDLC five phase initiation development acquisition implementation operation maintenance disposal

MITRE Systems Engineers SEs working government program propose influence often design risk management approach
They prepare monitor risk mitigation plan strategy government project program office review risk management plan prepared government contractor
As management process risk management used identify avoid potential cost schedule risk system take proactive structured approach manage negative outcome respond occur identify potential opportunity may hidden situation
The risk management approach plan operationalize management goal
Because two project exactly alike risk management approach plan tailored scope complexity individual project
Other consideration include role responsibility size project team risk management process required recommended government organization risk management tool available project
Risk occurs across spectrum government various enterprise individual system
At system level risk focus typically center development
Risk exists operation requirement design development integration testing training fielding etc
see section Guide
For dependency risk rise top
Working consistency across synchronizing capability development fielding considering whether interface interoperate integrate risk associated path come forefront environment
At enterprise level governance complexity risk become prominent
Governance risk different guidance across enterprise benefit enterprise trickle individual system resulting potentially unanticipated demand perhaps suboptimal solution low level may beneficial enterprise level
Dealing unknown increase risk associated Guide section loose coupling federated architecture portfolio help MITRE SE alleviate risk
risk management predominantly responsibility team working provide capability particular development effort
Within risk area primary responsibility fall system program manager SE working risk management developer integrator helping identify create approach reduce risk

The loss part supporting system degrades case eliminates performance capability whole
What make risk management engineering challenging managing risk traditional system engineering project
The basic risk management process step
The challenge come implementing managing process step across complex whose subordinate system manager stakeholder may geographically dispersed organizationally distributed may fully intersecting user need
How delivery capability time affect risk managed
The difficulty aligning mapping identified risk capability planned delivered within specified build specified time
Here critically important risk impact assessment made function capability affected effect occur impact user stakeholder
Lack clearly defined system boundary management line responsibility accountability challenge management risk engineering
User stakeholder acceptance risk management participation process essential success
Given program need establish environment reporting risk potential consequence encouraged rewarded
Without incomplete picture risk
Risks threaten successful engineering may become evident late effectively manage mitigate
Frequently planned engineered deliver capability series evolutionary build
Risks originate different source threaten different time evolution
These risk source mapped capability potentially affect according planned delivery date
Assessments made risk potential impact planned capability whether collateral effect dependent capability technology
In case overall risk linear subordinate risk
Rather combination specific lower level individual system risk put together potential adversely impact way equate simple risk
The result risk important individual system managed level others warrant attention engineering management
Risk management enterprise system pose even greater challenge risk management program

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

Lists stack queue structure three data structure one item follows another
Trees first structure Trees many us A tree sequence zero connected node example path tree shown The path number node path

In original example node A three subtrees An important special kind tree tree
In binary tree The two tree different child node B different first tree B left child D right child E second tree B left child E right child Also note line used instead arrow
We sometimes clear edge go higher node lower node
Since node never two child node represented using class field one data node plus two child pointer However since node arbitrary number child fixed number field wo work
Instead use List keep child pointer As know list represented using either array
For example consider general tree simplified version original example For array representation List array initial size would Draw similar picture tree List field implemented using linked list
It often useful iterate node tree When iterated List started first node visited node turn
Since node visited best possible complexity O N tree N node
All traversal method achieve complexity
For tree many different order might visit node
There three common traversal order general tree one binary tree preorder postorder level order described
We use illustrate traversal Preorder A preorder traversal defined recursively follows If use preorder traversal example tree given print letter node visit node following printed A B D C E G F H Postorder A postorder traversal similar preorder traversal except root subtree visited rather first If use postorder traversal example tree given print letter node visit node following printed D B G E H I F C A
Level order The idea traversal visit root visit node level away depth root left right node level away depth root etc
For example tree goal visit node following order A traversal requires using queue rather recursive algorithm implicitly us stack
Here print data tree level order using queue Q using iterator access child node assume root node called Treenode class provides method Draw picture Q would time around outer loop code given given
An traversal involves visiting root visiting left right subtrees
Therefore traversal make sense binary tree
The recursive definition If print letter node example tree using traversal following printed D B A E G C H F I The primary difference preorder postorder traversal node visited relation recursive call

The central idea new element added tree Now I sure even okay call one direction
But used traversal purpose need follow directed link
There couple simple category fit graph make easier classify
The graph drawn often called DAG short
Most thing refer tree fall category people usually call graph either undirected cyclic tree draw one give appearance root grown tree
People usually resort term graph case Above commonly seen well known classifier digging around Wikipedia may find others le known A tree special kind graph
More specifically
So graph tree
It matter grows
Yours directed graph really matter anyways

Growing direction purely artifact drew tree
Also little hard tell ASCII art top bottom connected cycle technically tree graph tree specific case
Based updated picture tree directed graph
What labeled root root multiple edge leading
A tree specific sort Directed Acyclic Graph additional constraint must single node without edge leading
That node root
As see none node graph satisfy definition
A tree acyclic graph
In undirected tree node root since edge undirected therefore child relationship
Most typically thought tree drawn mathematical definition apply
In directed tree usually single root define direction edge parent child
Which one usually implementation detail structure typically pointer parent child relational database use foreign key child parent
Note directed tree root direction arc represent relationship
This still three implementation simplification typical directed three le obvious
In case implementation could either treat three undirected add underlying rooted tree labeling relationship separately
In case edge direction drawn inconsistently I guess implementation would pick one flip arrow one half end pretty standard rooted tree
Of course keep subtree separate one would either use two independent tree initialize root two fixed node grow one independently

method solution problem depends solution smaller instance problem opposed
The approach applied many type problem one central idea computer science
The power recursion evidently lie possibility defining infinite set object finite statement
In manner infinite number computation described finite recursive program even program contains explicit repetition
Most computer programming language support recursion allowing call within program text
Some define looping construct rely solely recursion repeatedly call code
prof language computationally powerful Turing complete imperative language meaning solve kind problem imperative language even without iterative control structure
A common tactic divide problem type original solve combine result
This often referred combined store result solving avoid solving repeatedly incurring extra computation time referred
A recursive function definition one meaning input function produce result without recurring one meaning input program recurs call
For example function defined recursively equation
Neither equation constitutes complete definition first base case second recursive case
Because base case break chain recursion sometimes also called terminating case
The job recursive case seen breaking complex input simpler one
In properly designed recursive function recursive call input problem must simplified way eventually base case must reached
Functions intended terminate normal example exception
Neglecting write base case testing incorrectly cause
For function one computes obvious base case implied input data one may add number term added series example provide criterion establishes base case
Such example naturally treated successive term output partial sum converted recursion using indexing parameter say compute th term th partial sum
Many must process generate arbitrarily large quantity
Recursion one technique representing data whose exact size know programmer specify data definition
There two type definition inductive definition
An inductively defined recursive data definition one specifies construct instance data
For example defined inductively using syntax The code specifies list string either empty structure contains string list string
The definition permit construction list finite number string
Another example inductive positive Similarly recursive often used model structure programming language
Language designer often express grammar syntax grammar simple language arithmetic expression multiplication addition This say expression either number product two expression sum two expression
By recursively referring expression second third line grammar permit arbitrarily complex arithmetic expression one product sum operation single expression
A coinductive data definition one specifies operation may performed piece data typically coinductive definition used data structure infinite size
A coinductive definition infinite string given informally might look like This similar inductive definition list string difference definition specifies access content data via function content may whereas inductive definition specifies create structure may created
related coinduction used compute particular instance possibly infinite object
As programming technique used often context programming language preferable recursion desired size precision program output unknown
In case program requires definition infinitely large infinitely precise result mechanism taking finite portion result
The problem computing first n one solved corecursive program

Recursion contains single known recursion contains multiple known
Standard example single recursion include list traversal linear search computing factorial function standard example multiple recursion include search
Single recursion often much efficient multiple recursion generally replaced iterative computation running linear time requiring constant space
Multiple recursion contrast may require exponential time space fundamentally recursive able replaced iteration without explicit stack
Multiple recursion sometimes converted single recursion desired thence iteration
For example computing Fibonacci sequence naively multiple iteration value requires two previous value computed single recursion passing two successive value parameter
This naturally framed corecursion building initial value tracking step two successive value see
A sophisticated example using allows iterative tree traversal rather multiple recursion
Most basic example recursion example presented demonstrate function call
recursion occurs function called another function called either directly indirectly
For example call direct recursion call call indirect recursion Chains three function possible example function call function function call function function call function
Indirect recursion also called symmetric term though simply difference emphasis different notion
That call call turn call point view alone indirectly recursing point view alone indirectly recursing point view mutually recursing
Similarly set three function call called set mutually recursive function
Recursion usually done explicitly calling function name
However recursion also done via implicitly calling function based current context particularly useful known
Some author classify recursion either structural generative
The distinction related recursive procedure get data work process data Functions consume structured data typically decompose argument immediate structural component process component
If one immediate component belongs class data input function recursive
For reason refer function STRUCTURALLY RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
Thus defining characteristic structurally recursive function argument recursive call content field original input
Structural recursion includes nearly tree traversal including XML processing binary tree creation search etc
By considering algebraic structure natural number natural number either zero successor natural number function factorial may also regarded structural recursion
alternative Many recursive algorithm generate entirely new piece data given data recur
refers kind generative recursion
Examples generative recursion include
This distinction important function
A classic example recursive procedure function used calculate The function also written This evaluation recurrence relation demonstrates computation would performed evaluating pseudocode This factorial function also described without using recursion making use typical looping construct found imperative programming language The imperative code equivalent mathematical definition using accumulator variable The definition translates straightforwardly example iteration implemented recursively
The computes two integer written recursively
Function definition greatest common divisor express The recursive program equivalent iterative algorithm computation shown show step evaluation would performed language eliminates tail call
Below version algorithm using explicit iteration suitable language eliminate tail call
By maintaining state entirely variable using looping construct program avoids making recursive call growing call stack
The iterative algorithm requires temporary variable even given knowledge Euclidean algorithm difficult understand process simple inspection although two algorithm similar step
The Towers Hanoi mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion
There three peg hold stack disk different diameter
A larger disk may never stacked top smaller
Starting disk one peg must moved another peg one time
What smallest number step move stack
Example implementation Although recursive function explicit solution Tower Hanoi sequence reduced explicit formula
The algorithm method searching single element cutting array half recursive pas
The trick pick midpoint near center array compare data point data searched responding one three possible condition data found midpoint data midpoint greater data searched data midpoint le data searched
Recursion used algorithm pas new array created cutting old one half
The binary search procedure called recursively time new smaller array
Typically array size adjusted manipulating beginning ending index
The algorithm exhibit logarithmic order growth essentially divide problem domain half pas
Example implementation binary search C An important application recursion computer science defining dynamic data structure
Recursive data structure dynamically grow theoretically infinite size response runtime requirement contrast size static array must set compile time
Recursive algorithm particularly appropriate underlying problem data treated defined recursive term
The example section illustrate known structural recursion
This term refers fact recursive procedure acting data defined recursively
As long programmer derives template data definition function employ structural recursion
That recursion function body consume immediate piece given compound value
Below C definition linked list node structure
Notice especially node defined term
The next element pointer another effectively creating list type
Because data structure defined recursively procedure operate implemented naturally recursive procedure
The procedure defined walk list list empty list pointer value NULL
For node print data element integer
In C implementation list remains unchanged procedure
Below simple definition binary tree node
Like node linked list defined term recursively
There two pointer left pointing left right pointing right
Operations tree implemented using recursion
Note two pointer left right tree operation may require two recursive call At two recursive call made given call defined
The example illustrates binary tree
A special case binary tree data element node order
Since number file may vary practical way traverse thus enumerate content
Traversing filesystem similar therefore concept behind tree traversal applicable traversing filesystem
More specifically code would example filesystem
This code blend line least somewhat recursion
It essentially recursive implementation best way traverse
It also example direct indirect recursion
The method rtraverse purely direct example method traverse indirect call rtraverse
This example need base case scenario due fact always fixed number file directory given filesystem
In actual implementation rather pure recursive function single check base case otherwise recursive step number modification may made purpose clarity efficiency
These include On basis elegance wrapper function generally approved base case frowned upon particularly academia
Hybrid algorithm often used efficiency reduce overhead recursion small case recursion special case
A function directly called recurse instead calling separate auxiliary function actually recursion
Wrapper function used validate parameter recursive function skip perform initialization allocate memory initialize variable particularly auxiliary variable level recursion partial computation handle exception error
In language support auxiliary function nested inside wrapper function use shared scope
In absence nested function auxiliary function instead separate function possible private called directly information shared wrapper function using
base case also known consists checking base case making recursive call checking next call base case instead calling checking base case
particularly done efficiency reason avoid overhead function call immediately return
Note since base case already checked immediately recursive step need checked separately one need use wrapper function case overall recursion start base case
For example factorial function properly base case
immediately returning
may miss mitigated wrapper function
primarily concern many base case encountered Null pointer tree linear number function call hence significant saving algorithm illustrated search
tree corresponds considering leaf node child base case rather considering empty node base case
If single base case computing factorial provides saving
Conceptually considered either base case recursive step checking base case recursion considered different base case one step removed standard base case complex recursive step namely check valid recurse considering leaf node rather Null node base case tree
Because complicated flow compared clear separation base case recursive step standard recursion often considered poor style particularly academia
A basic example given DFS binary tree see section standard recursive discussion
The standard recursive algorithm DFS In instead In term standard step move base case check recursive step
Alternatively considered different form base case recursive step respectively
Note requires wrapper function handle case tree empty root node Null
In case height node Null pointer child leaf cut number function call half worst case
In C standard recursive algorithm may implemented The algorithm may implemented Note use Boolean AND operator recursive call made node valid
Note first term AND pointer node second term bool overall expression evaluates bool
This common idiom recursive
This addition evaluation Boolean OR operator check right child left child fails
In fact entire function replaced single Boolean expression return statement legibility suffers benefit efficiency
Recursive algorithm often inefficient small data due overhead repeated function call return
For reason efficient implementation recursive algorithm often start recursive algorithm switch different algorithm input becomes small
An important example often implemented switching data sufficiently small
Hybrid recursive algorithm often refined derived hybrid merge sort
Recursion iteration equally expressive recursion replaced iteration explicit stack iteration replaced tail recursion
Which approach preferable depends problem consideration language used
In iteration preferred particularly simple recursion avoids overhead function call call stack management recursion generally used multiple recursion
By contrast recursion preferred tail recursion optimization leading little overhead sometimes explicit iteration available
Compare template compute x defined x f n x x For imperative language overhead define function functional language overhead define accumulator variable x
For example factorial function may implemented iteratively C assigning loop index variable accumulator variable rather passing argument returning value recursion Most use today allow direct specification recursive function procedure
When function called program keep track various instance function often using although method may used
Every recursive function transformed iterative function replacing recursive call simulating call stack explicitly managed program
Conversely iterative function procedure evaluated computer see expressed term recursive function iterative control construct routinely rewritten recursive form
However practice rewriting depends feature language
notable mainstream language function call including may cause stack allocation would occur use looping construct language working iterative program rewritten recursive form may although tail call elimination may feature covered language specification different implementation language may differ tail call elimination capability
In language favor iterative looping construct usually significant time space cost associated recursive program due overhead required manage stack relative slowness function call function call particularly typically fast operation difference usually le noticeable
As concrete example difference performance recursive iterative implementation factorial example depends highly compiler used
In language looping construct preferred iterative version may much several order magnitude faster recursive one
In functional language overall time difference two implementation may negligible fact cost multiplying larger number first rather smaller number iterative version given happens may overwhelm time saved choosing iteration
In programming language maximum size much le space available recursive algorithm tend require stack space iterative algorithm
Consequently language sometimes place limit depth recursion avoid stack overflow one language
Note caveat regarding special case
Multiply recursive problem inherently recursive prior state need track
One example contrast list traversal linear search list singly recursive thus naturally iterative
Other example include function
All algorithm implemented iteratively help explicit programmer effort involved managing stack complexity resulting program arguably outweigh advantage iterative solution
function function recursive call hence build deferred operation
For example gcd function shown
In contrast factorial function also recursive call tail position build deferred multiplication operation must performed final recursive call completes
With treat call rather function call function gcd execute using constant space
Thus program essentially iterative equivalent using imperative language control structure like loop
The significance tail recursion making call tail call caller return position need saved recursive call return branch directly previously saved return position
Therefore language recognize property tail call tail recursion save space time
In simple case function calling instruction placed recursive call executed per recursion instruction placed recursive call
The latter executed repeatedly maximum recursion reached
Consider example The recursive algorithm expressed
They usually simplified single term
If function form Then thus represents number recursive call level recursion represents factor smaller input next level recursion
number piece divide problem represents work function independent recursion
partitioning recombining level recursion

The big advantage list sentence ability represent data mean sublists
In chapter look example use list sublists represent information structure
The kind structure consider called resemble tree nature The component tree called At top tree interior diagram bottom branch extend
We going begin considering tree abstract data type without thinking list used represent tree
For example construct tree using procedure named Scheme primitive
About halfway chapter explore relationship tree list
Here tree represents world Each node tree represents region world
Consider node labeled Great Britain
There two part node The obvious part label name Great Britain
But region world included within Great node attached beneath Great Britain also part node
We say every node zero For moment let say datum either word sentence
The child tree
Notice definition tree made tree
What base case
This family metaphor also part terminology tree
We say node another node two node In advanced treatment even hear thing like grandparent cousin wo get
What happens prune actual tree cutting branch
The part essentially tree smaller trunk fewer branch
The metaphor perfect part root still stick end ground hope end take root new tree
It country example country branch node entire world tree also tree
Depending think Great Britain either component entire world collection smaller location
So branch node represents Great Britain root node entire tree
What node
It might seem natural think node information one circle think node including datum
In way thinking node would separate every node word sentence separate element
However useful think node structure includes everything circle also datum child
So think node Great Britain thinking name Great Britain also everything Great Britain
From perspective root node tree includes entire tree
We might well say node tree
The constructor tree actually constructor one node root node
Our constructor tree therefore called
It take two argument datum possibly empty list child
As following example show constructing think one tree requires construction many node
You notice defined place shown figure
That got tired typing going invent abbreviation later
For take time show selector tree
tree node return datum node
node return list child node
A list tree called Here abbreviation help u construct world tree le typing
Unlike intended work tree general abbreviation designed world tree specifically mind With abbreviation world tree somewhat easier define Now tree many city world
At first glance may seem like simple case recursion calling
But since look like single recursive call really call equivalent recursive call one child given tree node
Note call call
This pattern called Mutual recursion often useful technique dealing tree
In typical recursion seen chapter moved sequentially list sentence recursive call taking u one step right
In following paragraph present three different model help think shape tree give rise mutual recursion
In first model going think initialization procedure helper procedure
Suppose want count leaf tree
Unless argument shallow tree involve counting leaf child tree
What want straightforward sequential recursion list child
But given wrong argument tree list child
So need initialization procedure whose job extract list child invoke helper procedure list argument
The helper procedure follows usual sequential list pattern Do something list recursively handle list
Now
In usual sequential recursion list something simple word
What special tree tree like entire data structure started
Therefore must invoke procedure whose domain tree
This model built two idea
One idea domain function reason need two procedure need one take tree argument one take list tree argument
The idea leap faith assume invocation within correctly handle child without tracing exact sequence event
The second model easier state le rigorous
Because nature tree order visit every node able move two different direction
From given node able move child child must able move next sibling
The job move left right list child
It using familiar kind recursion invokes directly
The downward motion happens move one level invoking
How program move one level
At level invoked recursively
The third model also based nature tree
Imagine moment node tree one child
In case could move root single leaf structure similar actual procedure carrying sequential recursion The trouble course downward step single next node
Instead single path root leaf multiple path root many leaf
To make idea downward motion sequential recursion work real tree level must clone many time child
factory manufacture clone
It hire one little person child accumulates result
The key point recursion tree child tree perfectly good tree
This recursiveness nature tree give rise recursive structure program use tree
The reason say recursive invocation cause one several recursive invocation one child way
In fact use name situation procedure invocation result one recursive call even argument tree
The computation Fibonacci number Chapter example tree recursion tree
The recursion Chapter also tree recursion structured somewhat character even though use formal mechanism exploring chapter
The recursion horizontal one moving one element another within list recursion vertical one exploring sublist given list
Procedures explore tree always simple
We started example could write using function understand structure problem take complexity mutual recursion
But many tree problem quite fit function
For example let write predicate take name place tree argument tell whether place tree
It possible make work This awkward construction however also performs unnecessary computation
If place looking happens first child node nevertheless look child well
We better replacing use mutual recursion Although mutual recursion little tricky read structure program fit way describe algorithm English
A place tree one two condition hold place datum root tree place recursively one child tree tree
That say
As say place one group tree place first tree one remaining tree
Our next project similar previous one little intricate
We like able locate city find larger region enclose city
For example want say Instead getting answer whether city tree want find
The algorithm recursive To look Berkeley within world need able look Berkeley within subtree
The node several child country
recursively asks child find path Berkeley
All one child return ca find Berkeley within territory
But node return To make complete path prepend name current node path
What happens try look Berkeley Australia
Since Australia child return path Berkeley Australia return
Compare structure
The helper procedure almost identical
The main procedure look different harder job check two possibility The city might datum argument node might belong one child tree
We done lot tree yet talked way Scheme store tree internally
How work
It turn convenient represent tree term list
In word tree list whose first element datum whose remaining element subtrees
Ordinarily however going print tree entirety
As example extract subset information put readable form
The procedure define abstract data type tree
Using ADT able write several useful procedure manipulate tree pinning exactly tree represented Scheme list
Although would possible refer part node using directly program readable use selector constructor
Consider example What mean context
Is tree datum
A child
A forest
Of course could work careful reasoning form presented example originally much clearer Even better would Using appropriate selector constructor called data abstraction
Failing use appropriate selector constructor called Since wrote selector constructor tree could defined use different representation You might expect change representation would require change procedure wrote earlier
But fact procedure would continue work perfectly see representation
They respect data abstraction
As long find right information matter tree stored
All matter constructor selector compatible
On hand example section violated data abstraction using find second child would fail changed representation
Many case like one formerly working program failed change representation led programmer use moralistic term respecting violating data abstraction
Consider notation arithmetic expression
Scheme us notation
By contrast people Scheme programmer generally represent arithmetic computation using notation function symbol go two argument
Our goal section translate infix arithmetic expression tree representing computation
This translation process called expression
For example turn expression tree The point using tree going easy perform computation tree form
In original infix form hard know first rule determine implicit grouping Multiplication division come addition subtraction operation precedence done left right
Our sample expression equivalent In tree representation easy see operation nearer leaf done first root node last operation depends result operation
Our program take argument infix arithmetic expression form list Each element list must one three thing number one four symbol sublist list example satisfying rule
You imagine implementing pocket calculator
If implementing computer programming language also accept variable name operand
But bothering complication really affect part problem turning expression tree
What make problem tricky ca put list element tree soon see
For example first three element sample list
It tempting build subtree three element But compare picture earlier picture correct tree see second argument invocation number rather subexpression
By reasoning might think examine entire expression start building tree
But fact sometimes build subtree confidence
For example see minus sign sample expression tell subexpression come complete higher precedence
Here plan
The program examine argument left right
Since program ca finish processing list element right away maintain information element examined entirely processed
It going easier maintain information two part one list operation another operand
Here first step parsing sample expression program examines element argument putting number onto operand list operation symbol onto operation list At point program looking operator infix expression
If newly seen operator lower precedence already head list operation would time carry operation creating tree root first two operand list child
Instead since higher precedence program ready create subtree must instead add operation list
This time newly seen operation lower precedence head operation list
Therefore time program operator making subtree containing operator first two element operand list
This new subtree becomes new first element operand list
Because program decided handle waiting operator still moved operator infix expression operator list
Now program must compare head list
These two operator precedence
Since want carry operator left right time handle operator
Finally program move operator onto operator list
The next several step similar one already seen
This new situation The first unseen element infix expression neither number operator sublist
We recursively subexpression adding resulting tree operand list
Then proceed processing higher precedence priority
Once program examined every element infix expression operator remaining operator list must handled
In case one operator
Once operator handled one element remaining operand list element desired tree entire original expression
The following program implement algorithm
It work correctly formed infix expression given argument like give incorrect result Scheme error
We promised building tree would easy compute value expression
Here program A leaf node perfectly good actual argument tree procedure even though picture leaf node look treeish branch
A common mistake make base case recursion node whose child leaf instead node leaf
The value returned tree forest
therefore suitable actual argument procedure expects tree
What mean printout
Why two set parenthesis
Suppose change definition tree constructor us instead How change selector everything still work
Write procedure take tree argument return largest number node connected link
That leaf node depth tree child root node leaf depth
Our world tree depth longest path root leaf example world country state city
Write procedure take tree argument return total number node tree
Earlier counted number node
Write procedure take tree argument return copy tree leaf node original tree removed
If argument tree root node child return result removing root node would tree
Write program par Scheme arithmetic expression kind tree produce infix expression
Assume procedure invocation Scheme expression two argument
The resulting tree valid argument You solve problem without restriction invocation rewrite assume every branch node two child
You probably think tree short tall
But since tree convention call shallow deep
Another example data abstraction violation Chapter
When creates empty database use constructor
Instead merely used quoted empty sentence Actually see shortly element operand list tree put operand list tree whose datum number

Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish

Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

Call tree play important role
They automated contact individual using landline email cellphone text message another type communication
Smaller organization often use manual call tree person receives call responsible calling others tree
The team creating call tree coordinate gathering contact data typically come department
Each listed employee may several contact including office home cellphone number email address
The list contact sequence notification approved emergency management team company management
The emergency call tree available several location company format someone keep information date
In term format call tree exist simple worksheet tabular structure listing call
During call tree initiated emergency management team completed assessment determined employee must notified
One employee designated launch emergency call tree
An organization alternate call tree lead event original lead available
As call tree progress member take note people ca reach data must relayed back emergency team
To ensure call completed planned last person list confirm receipt final call designated employee
Another designated employee serve communication list manager monitor response contact backup staff necessary
Once entire call tree notified procedure proceed
Call tree benefit include human interaction ability relay important information creation comprehensive list employee contact information
In manual case person call tree contact next person list everyone contacted
In event next person list reached caller continues next level phone tree chain break
The manual call tree procedure often simple effective may could take long large number employee need contacted
To address limitation automated method allows business continuity manager record employee
During call manager system receive input user Press need assistance
Because automated method place call simultaneously help reduce eliminate possible break emergency call tree

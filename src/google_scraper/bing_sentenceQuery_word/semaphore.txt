In used control access common resource multiple system operating system
A trivial semaphore plain variable changed example incremented decremented toggled depending condition
The variable used condition control access system resource
A useful way think semaphore used system record many unit particular resource available coupled operation adjust record
avoid unit required become free necessary wait unit resource becomes available
Semaphores useful tool prevention race condition however use mean guarantee program free problem
Semaphores allow arbitrary resource count called semaphore restricted value called used implement
The semaphore concept invented found widespread use variety
It also used control mechanism controller example computer
Suppose library identical study room used one student time
Students must request room front desk wish use study room
If room free student wait desk someone relinquishes room
When student finished using room student must return desk indicate one room become free
In simplest implementation clerk front desk know number free room available know correctly student actually use room signed return done
When student request room clerk decrease number
When student release room clerk increase number
The room used long desired possible book room ahead time
In scenario front desk represents counting semaphore room resource student represent
The value semaphore scenario initially room empty
When student request room granted access value semaphore changed
After next student come drop
If someone request room resulting value semaphore would negative forced wait room freed count increased
If one room released several student waiting method used select one occupy room like FIFO flipping coin
And course student need inform clerk releasing room really leaving otherwise awkward situation student process leaving room packing textbook etc
another student enters room leave
When used control access resource semaphore track resource free keep track resource free
Some mechanism possibly involving semaphore may required select particular free resource
The paradigm especially powerful semaphore count may serve useful trigger number different action
The librarian may turn light study hall student remaining may place sign say room busy room occupied
The success protocol requires application follow correctly
Fairness safety likely compromised practically mean program may behave slowly act erratically even single process act incorrectly
This includes Even process follow rule may still occur different resource managed different semaphore process need use one resource time illustrated
Counting semaphore equipped two operation historically denoted P V see alternative name
Operation V semaphore operation P
The value semaphore number unit resource currently available
The P operation resource protected semaphore becomes available time resource immediately claimed
The V operation inverse make resource available process finished using
One important property semaphore value changed except using V P operation
A simple way understand P V operation Many operating system provide efficient semaphore primitive unblock waiting process semaphore incremented
This mean process waste time checking semaphore value unnecessarily
The counting semaphore concept extended ability claim return one unit semaphore technique implemented
The modified V P operation follows using square bracket indicate operation appear indivisible perspective process However remainder section refers semaphore unary V P operation unless otherwise specified
To avoid semaphore associated process usually semantics
If process performs P operation semaphore value zero process added semaphore queue execution suspended
When another process increment semaphore performing V operation process queue one removed queue resume execution
When process different priority queue may ordered priority highest priority process taken queue first
If implementation ensure atomicity increment decrement comparison operation risk increment decrement forgotten semaphore value becoming negative
Atomicity may achieved using machine instruction able semaphore single operation
In absence hardware instruction atomic operation may synthesized use
On system atomic operation ensured temporarily suspending disabling hardware
This approach work multiprocessor system possible two program sharing semaphore run different processor time
To solve problem multiprocessor system locking variable used control access semaphore
The locking variable manipulated using command
Consider variable boolean variable
accessed marked true
Thus semaphore
One imagine stoplight signal train station
In case signal green one enter train station
If yellow red color train station accessed
Consider system support ten user
Whenever user log P called decrementing semaphore
Whenever user log V called incrementing representing login slot become available
When user wishing log must wait login request enqueued onto FIFO queue used ensure request enqueued order
Whenever becomes greater login slot available login request dequeued user owning request allowed log
In one process producer generates data item another process consumer receives us
They communicate using queue maximum size subject following condition The semaphore solution problem track state queue two semaphore number empty place queue number element queue
To maintain integrity may lower never higher actual number empty place queue may lower never higher actual number item queue
Empty place item represent two kind resource empty box full box semaphore maintain control resource
The binary semaphore ensures integrity state queue compromised example two producer attempting add item empty queue simultaneously thereby corrupting internal state
Alternatively could used place binary semaphore
The initially initially initially
The producer following repeatedly The consumer following repeatedly Below substantive example Note may much lower actual number empty place queue example case many producer decremented waiting turn filling empty place
Note always hold equality producer consumer executing critical section
The canonical name V P come initial word
V generally explained increase
Several explanation offered P including test try pas grab
Dijkstra earliest paper subject give passing meaning release meaning It also mention terminology taken used railroad signal
Dijkstra subsequently wrote intended stand short literally try reduce parallel term used case try decrease
In English textbook operation called respectively
In software engineering practice often called standard library us
Some text call match original Dutch initial
A essentially thing binary semaphore sometimes us basic implementation
The difference used
While binary semaphore may used mutex mutex specific thread locked mutex supposed unlock
This constraint make possible implement additional feature mutexes

A semaphore programming concept frequently used solve problem
My question community What semaphore use
Think semaphore bouncer nightclub
There dedicated number people allowed club
If club full one allowed enter soon one person leaf another person might enter
It simply way limit number consumer specific resource
For example limit number simultaneous call database application
Here pedagogic example C The article Michael Barr great short introduction make mutexes semaphore different used
I excerpted several key paragraph
The key point mutexes used protect shared resource semaphore used signaling
You generally use semaphore protect shared resource mutexes signaling
There issue instance bouncer analogy term using semaphore protect shared resource use way may cause hard diagnose bug
While mutexes semaphore similarity implementation always used differently
The common nonetheless incorrect answer question posed top mutexes semaphore similar significant difference semaphore count higher one
Nearly engineer seem properly understand mutex binary flag used protect shared resource ensuring mutual exclusion inside critical section code
But asked expand use counting semaphore degree flavor textbook opinion used protect several equivalent resource
At point interesting analogy made using idea bathroom key protecting shared resource bathroom
If shop single bathroom single key sufficient protect resource prevent multiple people using simultaneously
If multiple bathroom one might tempted key alike make multiple key similar semaphore
Once key actually know bathroom available go path probably going end using mutexes provide information make sure take bathroom already occupied
A semaphore wrong tool protect several essentially resource many people think use
The bouncer analogy distinctly different several type resource instead one resource accept multiple simultaneous user
I suppose semaphore used situation rarely situation analogy actually hold often several type still individual resource like bathroom used way

The correct use semaphore signaling one task another
A mutex meant taken released always order task us shared resource protects
By contrast task use semaphore either signal
For example Task may contain code post signal increment particular semaphore power button pressed Task wake display pends semaphore
In scenario one task producer event signal consumer

Here important point made mutexes interfere real time operating system bad way causing priority inversion le important task may executed important task resource sharing
In short happens lower priority task us mutex grab resource A try grab B paused B unavailable
While waiting higher priority task come along need A already tied process even running waiting B
There many way resolve often fixed altering mutex task manager
The mutex much complex case binary semaphore using semaphore instance cause priority inversion task manager unaware priority inversion act correct

The cause widespread modern confusion mutexes semaphore historical date way back invention Semaphore capital S article Djikstra
Prior date none task synchronization signaling mechanism known computer scientist efficiently scalable use two task
Dijkstra revolutionary Semaphore applied critical section protection signaling
And thus confusion began
However later became obvious operating system developer appearance preemptive RTOS VRTX ca
publication academic paper establishing RMA problem caused priority inversion paper priority inheritance protocol became apparent mutexes must semaphore binary counter
Mutex resource sharing Semaphore signaling Do use one without careful consideration side effect
Mutex access resource Semaphore access resource That mutex used syncronize access counter file database etc
A sempahore thing support fixed number simultaneous caller
For example I wrap database call semaphore multithreaded app hit database simultaneous connection
All attempt block one three slot open
They make thing like naive throttling really really easy
Craig A semaphore way lock resource guaranteed piece code executed piece code access resource
This keep two thread concurrently accesing resource cause problem
This restricted one thread
A semaphore configured allow fixed number thread access resource
Semaphore also used semaphore
For example multiple process enqueuing data queue one task consuming data queue
If want consuming task constantly poll queue available data use semaphore
Here semaphore used exclusion mechanism signaling mechanism
The consuming task waiting semaphore The producing task posting semaphore
This way consuming task running data dequeued There two essential concept building concurrent program synchronization mutual exclusion
We see two type lock semaphore generally kind locking mechanism help u achieve synchronization mutual exclusion
A semaphore programming construct help u achieve concurrency implementing synchronization mutual exclusion
Semaphores two type Binary Counting
A semaphore two part counter list task waiting access particular resource
A semaphore performs two operation wait P like acquiring lock release V similar releasing lock two operation one perform semaphore
In binary semaphore counter logically go
You think similar lock two value
A counting semaphore multiple value count
What important understand semaphore counter keep track number task block make progress
Tasks block add semaphore list counter zero
Therefore task get added list P routine progress freed using V routine
Now fairly obvious see binary semaphore used solve synchronization mutual exclusion essentially lock
ex
Synchronization In example execute finished execution
Let say thread A come executes first get wait since counter closed
Thread B come along finish free thread A completes
So achieve synchronization
Now let look mutual exclusion binary semaphore The mutual exclusion quite simple well enter critical section time
So thread using semaphore provide mutual exclusion two critical section
Now possible greater concurrency
Depends critical section
Think else one could use semaphore achieve mutual hint hint necessarily need use one semaphore
Counting semaphore A semaphore one value
Let look implying lock one value
So open closed hmm
Of use mutual exclusion synchronization
Let take easier two Synchronization using counting semaphore Let say task want executed
How would design synchronization
So semaphore start closed ensure block get added semaphore list
Then along come important finish business free
What order freed
Depends implementation semaphore list
Could FIFO could based particular priority etc
Note think would arrange P V wanted executed particular order aware implementation semaphore Find What happens number V greater number P
Mutual Exclusion Using counting semaphore I like construct pseudocode make understand thing better
fundamental concept counting semaphore counter N allows N task enter critical section freely
What mean N task thread like enter critical section task get blocked go favorite list let somebody V semaphore least
So semaphore counter instead swinging go N allowing N task freely enter exit blocking nobody
Now gosh would need stupid thing
Is whole point mutual exclusion let one guy access resource
Hint Hint You always one drive computer
Is mutual exclusion achieved counting semaphore alone
What instance resource thread come counting semaphore try use first instance
A semaphore object containing natural number
integer greater equal zero two modifying operation defined
One operation add natural
The operation decrease natural number
Both activity atomic
operation executed time
Because natural number decreased calling semaphore containing block execution calling process moment number longer successfully atomically executed
As mentioned answer semaphore used restrict access certain resource maximum variable number process
A hardware software flag
In multi tasking system semaphore variable value indicates status common process needing resource check semaphore determine resource status decides proceed
So imagine everyone trying go bathroom certain number key bathroom
Now enough key left person need wait
So think semaphore representing set key available bathroom system resource different process bathroom goer request access
Now imagine two process trying go bathroom time
That good situation semaphore used prevent
Unfortunately semaphore voluntary mechanism process bathroom goer ignore
even key someone still kick door open
There also difference counting semaphore
Check lecture note
Consider taxi
The taxi accommodate maximum rear front person including driver
So semaphore allows person inside car time
And mutex allows person seat car
So mutex allow exclusive access resource
A semaphore allows eccess n number resource time
In programming especially Unix system semaphore technique coordinating synchronizing activity multiple process compete operating system resource
A semaphore value designated place operating system storage process check change
Depending value found process use resource realize already use wait period trying
Semaphores binary additional value
Typically process using semaphore check value using resource change value reflect subsequent semaphore user know wait
Semaphores commonly use two purpose To share common memory space To share access file
Semaphores one technique interprocess communication IPC
The C programming language provides set interface function managing semaphore
A semaphore way lock resource guaranteed piece code executed piece code access resource
This keep two thread concurrently accesing resource cause problem
This old question one interesting us semaphore lock explicitly mentioned
The lock work simple fashion consume one permit reader permit writer
Indeed trivial implementation lock requires metadata modification read actually twice become bottle neck still significantly better mutex lock
Another downside writer started rather easily well unless semaphore fair one writes acquire permit multiple request case need explicit mutex
Further Here interesting knowledge semaphore Semaphores programming construct designed Dijkstra late
Dijkstra model operation railroad consider stretch railroad single track one train time allowed
Guarding track semaphore
A train must wait entering single track semaphore state permit travel
When train enters track semaphore change state prevent train entering track
A train leaving section track must change state semaphore allow another train enter
In computer version semaphore appears simple integer
A thread wait permission proceed signal proceeded performing P operation semaphore
The semantics operation thread must wait semaphore value positive change semaphore value subtracting one
When finished thread performs V operation change semaphore value adding one
It crucial operation take place subdivided piece action semaphore take place
In P operation semaphore value must positive decremented resulting value guaranteed nonnegative one le decremented
In P V operation arithmetic must take place without interference
If two V operation performed simultaneously semaphore net effect semaphore new value two greater
The mnemonic significance P V unclear world Dijkstra Dutch
However interest true scholarship P stand prolagen word derived proberen te verlagen mean try decrease
V stand verhogen mean increase
This discussed one Dijkstra technical note EWD correspond Dijkstra P V operation
conditional form P operation calling thread decrement value semaphore without waiting call return immediately nonzero value
There two basic sort semaphore binary semaphore never take value zero one counting semaphore take arbitrary nonnegative value
A binary semaphore logically like mutex
However although enforced mutexes unlocked thread holding lock
There notion thread holding semaphore thread perform V operation
Counting semaphore powerful conditional variable used conjunction mutexes
In many case code might simpler implemented counting semaphore rather condition variable shown next example
However mutex used condition variable implied clear part program protected
This necessarily case semaphore might called go concurrent powerful easy use unstructured indeterminate way

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Are method I use
A binary semaphore two possible state
The operation atomically look state state state decremented process continue
If state process atomically placed queue waiter process block
The operation atomically look state state process blocked exactly one woken
If blocked process value semaphore set
I specifically need binary semaphore
A mutex assumes process first lock resource used process unlock mutex
But case process semaphore operation without ever performing operation
How I make sure value counting semaphore never go
I asked Stack Overflow specifically solving problem POSIX synchronization APIs suggestion I got use file locking much slower semaphore also seems mutex semantics I ca use
A binary semaphore semaphore whose value limited locked unlocked locked unlimited queue task waiting
When using semaphore careful never increment past
The point value thus limited trick possible speed implementation quite bit also common use think using semaphore mutex
There real conceptual difference involved
If want detailed discussion use semaphore synchronization primitive implementation discussion see Downey

Well need discussion Semaphore concept play major role
Some time need review current Semaphore status server need kill entry free memory allocation system
Okay let start
Semaphores IPC mean
These used allow different process communicate
See wiki say Semaphores used communicating active process certain application say Apache application
As Linux Server Admin must faced known common error Semaphore restarting web server Apache
Yeah error
I know solution
Check tutorial Heba get idea Semaphore error Apache Considering scenario Apache Semaphores used communicate Apache parent child process
If Apache write thing communicate properly process start
So start process
Semaphores mark memory location locked free may release completing actual process
In case parent process dy without killing child process properly
This condition happen busy server high uptime
Commonly showing error pasted Yeah need restart Apache however semaphore start Apache server
Okay plan kill
Dear Shell Lovers solution
Execute following command check Semaphores detail Linux command line
The command display status Semaphores server
See example pasted Note user Semaphore ID process listed command
If Apache causing problem Semaphore see lot process user apache nobody
We need kill process start Apache properly
To kill Semaphore process use command along switch
See syntax pasted To kill Semaphores listed user Apache first must know user name Apache server
Then execute following command Or Or Considering user Apache nobody
It remove Semaphores Apache user
Now able start Apache server normally
Use following command print current Semaphore configuration detail See sample output pasted If problem occurring continuously need increase value
This done increasing following entry Then run sysctl pick new change
Done
I sure much familiar Semaphore Linux
Thanks

In asserted said algorithm correct respect
correctness refers behaviour algorithm input produce expected output
A distinction made requires answer returned correct additionally requires algorithm terminates
Since general solution total correctness assertion may lie much deeper
A type play critical role total correctness algorithm depends termination
For example successively searching see find example odd quite easy write partially correct program using long division two check perfect
But say program totally correct would assert something
A proof would mathematical proof assuming algorithm specification given formally
In particular expected correctness assertion given program implementing algorithm given machine
That would involve consideration limitation
A state proof functional correctness corresponds certain program
Converting proof way called
specific reasoning rigorously correctness computer program
It us axiomatic technique define programming language semantics argue correctness program assertion known Hoare triple
Software testing activity aimed evaluating attribute capability program system determining meet required result
Although crucial software quality widely deployed programmer tester software testing still remains art due limited understanding principle software
The difficulty software testing stem complexity software completely test program moderate complexity
Testing debugging
The purpose testing quality assurance verification validation reliability estimation
Testing used generic metric well
Correctness testing reliability testing two major area testing
Software testing budget time quality

The proof correctness algorithm generally us type invariant algorithm show correctly performs task type input
You necessarily need proof correctness implement algorithm definitely aid understanding algorithm work
Writing proof correctness requires understanding discrete math logic especially since proof algorithm especially recursive nature quick sort binary search require mathematical induction
Some proof correctness also rely method proof proof contradiction proof case
Understanding general structure type proof definitely aid generating proof correctness algorithm

How I prove algorithm correctness
face problem come solution way know valid solution trying test case
pas algorithm produce expected output algorithm properly true
obviously hold time may forget corner case hard figure test case
So I prove mathematically algorithm produce expected output
For example consider program
given read array n integer
Find integer occurs time array linear time constant additional space
Algorithm We use array size count occurrence number let count adding number count array proper count
If reach size count array decrement one count number
If number count becomes zero safely eliminated count array
Here example We make another loop input array count occurrence one exceeds printed
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
In practice prove algorithm search good invariant property loop
For example compute given order sum n integer loop indexed invariant could At end iteration sum variable contains sum first value
It invariant iteration number always true easy prove recurrence iteration number
Afterwards easily conclude end loop thus sum expected sum
Then several level strictness simple algorithm generally conclude promptly since correction algorithm becomes almost always trivial loop invariant
A classical approach prove algorithm finish algorithm correct end
For complete example look
For subtil algorithm also need mathematical theorem provide link beetween object
Your example close algorithm
You look proof algorithm try adapt try bound number time count frequent number decreased
In general systematic way find algorithm produce expected output
Indeed systematic way would algorithm algorithm ca exist

Does anyone complete example proof program correctness
I talking something includes usual predicate base case inductive hypothesis inductive step
But also important loop invariant termination
I sure proper format something like
The thing I able find powerpoint slide random school teaching purpose place
I looking something start finish easy follow formatted nicely submitted academically
I wish understand program proof look like used real rather proof sketch toy example classroom
You find collection proof technique illustrated poof small program following paper Manna Ness Vuillemin CACM August
It made available web one author
It also first paper I ever read subject I remember enjoying
But I would expect literature web refereed paper textbook source
include considerable number proof considering today people working proof real program help mechanized proof system
OF course aware thing correctness absolute sense
Correctness defined respect specification
predicate logic also express meaning program whatever part relevant
Of course different way defining semantics program
So one might expect proof technique vary accordingly

Correctness meaningful respect specification
So rephrased version question algorithm correct respect given specification
Essentially want prove algorithm indeed computes want
Therefore able specify want formally
For example Say want write subroutine take two number computes maximum two number For need specify formally want
Assume use place holder return value subroutine
I would recommend write logical formula specifies maximum two argument provided
The formula would call formula In fact formula specifies post condition subroutine
A condition hold subroutine completes execution
Since restriction input function would say precondition condition hold beginning subroutine work properly
Now say one implementation follows Now see branch subroutine return So logically say Similarly branch logical formula representing program The reason I put quote logical formula specifies transition relation input related output
It capture relation possible value input concrete execution program deal one particular input value
Since program take either path corresponding logical formula capture would call formula Note Or T P logical implication
Because implication hold say program correct
If implication hold might case T would true P would false
This scenario would represent case program behave way intended behave
If want study formally study
It one tool used formally prove correctness program
What I discussed one many way people argue correctness
I hope helped bit

Let k multiple n
Show n language Bn regular
Proof construction Let set multiple n So language Let try construct NFA So regular Let Cn x binary number multiple n
Show n language Cn regular
Proof Construction Let set binary number multiple n So construct following NFA The number arrow leaving state equal cardinality set
represents NFA l n Showing exists NFA accepts binary number trivial
Therefore regular
I know I kind took easy way I think work
Let focus second problem
I use example
Every natural number divided give remainder one
Our goal build automaton whose state grouped according
In case going three class two state shall see
The automaton state class number give remainder
For simplicity assume read number least significant bit significant bit could make opposite assumption well
The next important observation value bit string represents unsigned binary number given n
Each element summation contributes total remainder independently others modular addition commutative associative
In particular case otherwise
case The independence contribution make possible u read number either end
The final observation alternate
For example
It whether even odd matter
If automaton read six state read nine three namely state zero remainder reading even number bit
After reading thirty another state remembers remainder reading odd number bit
Since state must remember whether read even number bit even odd number bit odd use right value need six state namely e e e
The first component state keep track remainder accumulated far second component even odd tell u value
If state read know even though lost track exact value know even remainder far
The next remainder therefore next state e accordingly
You complete construction
The initial state e accepting state e
This method generalizes arbitrary n follows There exactly n possible residue n different value n
Hence state automaton
What really matter finitely many
For signed integer say represented two complement thing bit messier approach

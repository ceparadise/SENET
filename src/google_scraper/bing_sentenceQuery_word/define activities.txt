distinct successful defines science strictest sense term
Science original sense word type knowledge rather specialized word pursuit knowledge
In particular type knowledge people communicate share
For example knowledge working natural thing gathered long recorded history led development complex abstract thought
This shown construction complex calendar technique making poisonous plant edible national scale harnessed reservoir dam dike building
However consistent conscientious distinction made knowledge thing true every community type communal knowledge mythology legal system
Before invention discovery word tend used describe way plant grows way example one tribe worship particular god
For reason claimed men first philosopher strict sense also first people clearly distinguish nature convention
Science therefore distinguished knowledge nature thing true every community name specialized pursuit knowledge realm first
They mainly speculator particularly interested
In contrast trying use knowledge nature imitate nature artifice Greek seen classical scientist appropriate interest lower class artisan
The early founded later continued successor first attempt explain without relying
The developed complex number philosophy contributed significantly development mathematical science
The developed Greek philosopher student

This reaction emphasis
The Socratic method search general commonly held truth shape belief scrutinizes determine consistency belief
Socrates criticized older type study physic purely speculative lacking
Socrates later word accused corrupts youth believe god state belief new spiritual being
Socrates refuted claim sentenced death
later created systematic programme philosophy Motion change described actualization potential already thing according type thing
In physic sun go around earth many thing part nature human
Each thing role cosmic order
While Socratics insisted philosophy used consider practical question best way live human study Aristotle divided argue type
Aristotle maintained man know thing scientifically posse conviction arrived certain way first principle conviction rest known certainty

Aristotle prescribed four question answered order explain thing scientifically
Some ancient knowledge lost case kept obscurity fall Roman Empire periodic political struggle
However general field science called much general knowledge ancient world remained preserved work early Latin encyclopedist like
However Aristotle original text eventually lost Western Europe one text Plato widely known Platonic dialogue one original work classical natural philosophy available Latin reader early Middle Ages
Another original work gained influence period contains geocentric description solar system
In many Greek science text preserved translation done group Nestorians Monophysites

Alhazen disproved Ptolemy theory vision make corresponding change Aristotle metaphysics
The scientific revolution ran concurrently process element Aristotle metaphysics ethic teleology formal causality slowly fell favour
Scholars slowly came realize universe might well devoid purpose ethical imperative
Many restriction described Aristotle later favoured Catholic Church thus challenged
This development physic infused goal ethic spirit toward physic element play integral role took century
New development optic played role inception Renaissance challenging metaphysical idea perception well contributing improvement development technology

made innovative use experiment mathematics
However became persecuted Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo write Copernican system
Galileo used argument Pope put voice simpleton work Dialogue Concerning Two Chief World Systems greatly offended
In Northern Europe new technology widely used publish many argument including disagreed widely contemporary idea nature
published philosophical argument favor new type science
Descartes emphasized individual thought argued mathematics rather geometry used order study nature
Bacon emphasized importance experiment contemplation
Bacon questioned Aristotelian concept formal cause final cause promoted idea science study law simple nature heat rather assuming specific nature complex type thing
This new modern science began see describing
This updated approach study nature seen
Bacon also argued science aim first time practical invention improvement human life
As precursor Age Enlightenment succeeded developing new physic referred could confirmed experiment explained using mathematics
Leibniz also incorporated term used new way example modern version Aristotelian
This implied shift view object Where Aristotle noted object certain innate goal actualized object regarded devoid innate goal
In style Francis Bacon Leibniz assumed different type thing work according general law nature special formal final cause type thing
It period word science gradually became commonly used refer type knowledge especially knowledge nature coming close meaning old term
Science Enlightenment dominated scientific society largely replaced university centre scientific research development
Societies academy also backbone maturation scientific profession
Another important development science among increasingly literate population

The seek explain event way
An explanatory put forward explanation using principle parsimony also known generally expected seek well accepted fact related phenomenon
This new explanation used make prediction testable experiment observation
The prediction posted confirming experiment observation sought proof tampering occurred
Disproof prediction evidence progress
This done partly observation natural phenomenon also experimentation try simulate natural event controlled condition appropriate discipline observational science astronomy geology predicted observation might take place controlled experiment
Experimentation especially important science help establish avoid
When hypothesis prof unsatisfactory either modified discarded
If hypothesis survived testing may become adopted framework logically reasoned model framework describing behavior certain natural phenomenon
A theory typically describes behavior much broader set phenomenon hypothesis commonly large number hypothesis logically bound together single theory
Thus theory hypothesis explaining various hypothesis
In vein theory formulated according scientific principle hypothesis
In addition testing hypothesis scientist may also generate attempt describe depict phenomenon term logical physical mathematical representation generate new hypothesis tested based observable phenomenon
While performing experiment test hypothesis scientist may preference one outcome another important ensure science whole eliminate bias

essential science
One important function mathematics science role play expression scientific model
Observing collecting well hypothesizing predicting often require extensive use mathematics
For example essential
Virtually every branch mathematics application science including pure area
mathematical technique summarizing analyzing data allow scientist ass level reliability range variation experimental result
Statistical analysis play fundamental role many area natural science social science

According computation important theory experiment advancing scientific knowledge
Other formal science include
Such science involve study well defined abstract system depend heavily mathematics
They involve empirical procedure result derived logically definition nature
Parts natural social science based empirical result depend heavily mathematical development include
Whether mathematics properly classified science matter debate
Some thinker see mathematician scientist regarding physical experiment inessential mathematical proof equivalent experiment
Others see mathematics science require experimental test theory hypothesis
Mathematical obtained derivation presume system rather combination logical reasoning come known
In general mathematics classified natural social science classified science
The scientific community group interacting scientist
It includes many working particular scientific field within particular institution interdisciplinary activity also significant
Scientific field commonly divided two major group study natural phenomenon including study
These science mean knowledge must based observable capable tested validity researcher working condition
There also related discipline grouped interdisciplinary
Within category specialized scientific field include part scientific discipline often posse expertise
classified similarity difference empirical science natural social science
It similar empirical science involves objective careful systematic study area knowledge different method verifying knowledge using rather empirical method
The formal science also include vital empirical science
Major advance formal science often led major advance empirical science
The formal science essential formation discovering describing thing work natural science people think act social science
Apart broad meaning word science sometimes may specifically refer math natural science alone
Science school faculty within many institution separate medicine engineering

The first scientific journal followed began publication
Since time total number active periodical steadily increased
In one estimate number scientific technical journal publication
The currently index journal contain article topic related life science
Although journal language percent indexed article published English
Most scientific journal cover single scientific field publish research within field research normally expressed form
Science become pervasive modern society generally considered necessary communicate achievement news ambition scientist wider populace

Tangentially genre primarily fantastic nature engages public imagination transmits idea method science
Recent effort intensify develop link science discipline specifically include resource developed
Science historically field notable exception
Women faced considerable discrimination science much area society frequently passed job opportunity denied credit work
For example able enter PhD program Ladd Christine Kitty Ladd completed requirement awarded degree career spanned algebra logic see color vision psychology
Her work preceded notable researcher like
The achievement woman science attributed defiance traditional role laborer within
In late century active recruitment woman elimination institutional discrimination basis sex greatly increased number woman scientist large gender disparity remain field half new biologist female PhDs physic given men
Feminists claim result culture rather innate difference sex experiment shown parent challenge explain boy girl asking reflect deeply logically
In early part century America woman earned bachelor degree master degree PhDs science engineering field woman earning half degree three field Psychology Social Sciences Biology
However come Physical Sciences Geosciences Math Engineering Computer Science woman earned le half degree
However lifestyle choice also play major role female engagement science woman young child le likely take position due balance issue female graduate student interest career research decline dramatically course graduate school whereas male colleague remains unchanged
Science policy area concerned policy affect conduct scientific enterprise including often pursuance national policy goal technological innovation promote commercial product development weapon development health care environmental monitoring
Science policy also refers act applying scientific knowledge consensus development public policy
Science policy thus deal entire domain issue involve natural science
In accordance concerned citizen science policy goal consider science technology best serve public
influenced funding civil engineering work 孫叔敖 BCE 西門豹 Shi Chi BCE science thousand year
These work date least time inspired study logic period study defensive fortification took year complete China
In governmental approval century recognized exists day
The professionalization science begun century partly enabled creation scientific organization state funding university respective nation
Public policy directly affect funding intellectual infrastructure industrial research providing tax incentive organization fund research
director United States government forerunner wrote July Science proper concern government
research often funded competitive process potential research project evaluated promising receive funding
Such process run government corporation foundation allocate scarce fund
Total research funding
In around scientific technical field carried industry respectively government
The government funding proportion certain industry higher dominates research
Similarly exception
government provides bulk fund
In commercial research development corporation focus heavily commercialisation possibility rather idea technology
The face number pressure prevent accurately depicting competing scientific claim term credibility within scientific community whole
Determining much weight give different side may require considerable expertise regarding matter
Few journalist real scientific knowledge even know great deal certain scientific issue may ignorant scientific issue suddenly asked cover
Many issue damage relationship science medium use science scientific argument
As broad generalisation many politician seek certainty whilst scientist typically offer probability caveat
However politician ability heard frequently distorts scientific understanding public
Examples include controversy forced resignation Government Minister revealing high probability farmed egg contaminated
researcher US Canada described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods SCAMs organization think tank make goal cast doubt supported science conflict political agenda
Hank Campbell microbiologist Alex Berezow described fallacy used politics especially left politician frame position way make people feel good supporting certain policy even scientific evidence show need worry need dramatic change current program

Science represented
Working scientist usually take granted set basic assumption needed justify scientific method objective reality shared rational observer objective reality governed natural law law discovered mean systematic observation experimentation
Philosophy science seek deep understanding underlying assumption mean whether valid
The belief scientific theory represent reality known
It contrasted view success science depend accurate unobservable entity
One form belief mind basic essence mind generates reality
In idealistic true one mind need true mind
There different school thought philosophy science
The popular position hold knowledge created process involving observation scientific theory result generalization observation
Empiricism generally encompasses position try explain way general theory justified finite number observation human make hence finite amount empirical evidence available confirm scientific theory
This necessary number prediction theory make infinite mean known finite amount evidence using
Many version empiricism exist predominant one
Empiricism stood contrast position originally associated hold knowledge created human intellect observation
contrasting approach science first defined philosopher
Popper rejected way empiricism describes connection theory observation
He claimed theory generated observation observation made light theory way theory affected observation come conflict
Popper proposed replacing verifiability landmark scientific theory replacing induction empirical method
Popper claimed actually one universal method specific science negative method criticism
It cover product human mind including science mathematics philosophy art
Another approach colloquially termed shut multiply emphasizes utility theory instrument explaining predicting phenomenon
It view scientific theory black box input initial condition output prediction relevant
Consequences theoretical entity logical structure claimed something simply ignored scientist make fuss see
Close instrumentalism according main criterion success scientific theory whether say observable entity true
advanced idea hold useful governing growth idea science operate according universal fixed rule unrealistic pernicious detrimental science
Feyerabend advocate treating science alongside others considers dominance science society unjustified
He also contended along distinguishing science objective ground possible thus fatal notion science running according fixed universal rule
Feyerabend also stated science evidence philosophical precept particularly notion
Finally another approach often cited debate controversial movement like
Its main point difference natural explanation made science restricted methodologically natural explanation
That restriction merely methodological rather ontological mean science consider supernatural explanation claim wrong either
Instead supernatural explanation left matter personal belief
Methodological naturalism maintains proper science requires strict adherence study independent verification process properly developing evaluating explanation phenomenon
The absence standard biased common frequently cited supporter methodological naturalism characteristic criticize
A scientific theory always open new evidence presented
That theory ever considered strictly science accepts concept
The philosopher science sharply distinguished truth certainty
He wrote scientific knowledge consists search truth search certainty All human knowledge fallible therefore uncertain
New scientific knowledge rarely result vast change understanding
According psychologist may medium overuse word like breakthrough lead public imagine science constantly proving everything thought true false
While famous case required complete reconceptualization extreme exception
Knowledge science gained gradual synthesis information different experiment various across different branch science like climb leap
Theories vary extent tested verified well acceptance scientific community
For example still bear name theory even though practice considered
Philosopher add although best definition contested entertaining one incorrect compatible correct
Ironically scientist adhering proper scientific approach doubt even posse
The argued inquiry struggle resolve actual doubt merely quarrelsome verbal fruitless also inquirer try attain genuine doubt rather resting uncritically common sense
He held successful science trust single chain inference stronger weakest link cable multiple various argument intimately connected
Stanovich also asserts science avoids searching magic bullet avoids
This mean scientist would ask merely What cause rather What significant
This especially case macroscopic field science

Of course often analyzes factor always added long list factor important consider
For example knowing detail person genetics history upbringing current situation may explain behavior deep understanding variable combined predictive
An area study speculation masquerade science attempt claim legitimacy would otherwise able achieve sometimes referred
Physicist coined term case researcher believe science activity outward appearance science actually lack kind utter honesty allows result rigorously evaluated
Various type commercial advertising ranging hype fraud may fall category
There also element political ideological bias side scientific debate
Sometimes research may characterized bad science research may actually incorrect obsolete incomplete exposition scientific idea
The term refers situation researcher intentionally misrepresented published data purposely given credit discovery wrong person
Although encyclopedia Pliny fl
AD offered purported fact proved unreliable
A skeptical point view demanding method proof practical position taken deal unreliable knowledge
As early year ago scholar Francis Bacon provided address point uncertainty
In particular fallacious reasoning exposed
If man begin certainty shall end doubt content begin doubt shall end certainty
The method problem known thousand year extend beyond theory practice
The use example practical approach settle dispute community
point fundamental creation scientific knowledge
Ziman show scientist identify pattern across century refers ability perceptual consensibility
He make consensibility leading consensus touchstone reliable knowledge
Although scientific research specific problem great deal understanding come undertaking
This lead option technological advance planned sometimes even imaginable
This point made Michael Faraday allegedly response question basic research
responded Sir use child
For example research effect red light human eye seem practical purpose eventually discovery troubled red light would lead team among others adopt red light cockpit jet helicopter
In nutshell basic research search knowledge applied research search solution practical problem using knowledge
Finally even basic research take unexpected turn sense scientific method built
Due increasing complexity information specialization scientist research today done group scientist rather individual

Simonton note due breadth precise far reaching tool already used researcher today amount research generated far creation new discipline revolution within discipline may longer possible unlikely phenomenon merit discipline overlooked
Hybridizing discipline finessing knowledge view future science
Discoveries fundamental science
For example

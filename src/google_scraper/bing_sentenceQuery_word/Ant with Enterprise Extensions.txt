When define Ant build file conditional using unless attribute
On target prevent task run
But task conditionally run condition
My thought proved incorrect Ant would prevent task extend run
Here example build script showing problem Using command Relults You notice target executed skipped
Since task exactly skipped
Any target depend still get executed since skipped target successful target
What value attribute
I guessing actual probably appear attribute extends target associated java class

Arguably best thing Firefox thousand available double edged sword
Like Firefox user I handful extension I could live without
Its keep using browser despite many advantage Google Chrome
But downside extension came light recently revelation secretly tracked every visited website
Surprisingly got little traction press
I ran across May article
The secret tracking discovered Simon Newton first
He found every time went web page either public Internet private Intranet Firefox browser contacting computer named sending name currently displayed web page
He writes addon fact contrary published privacy policy clandestinely collecting data every site addon user visit video site specifically tying back via cookie appears unique identifier aka
This happens regular browsing browsing corporate VPN mode browsing via proxy anonymising service Tor completely bypassing many layer anonymity security afforded service proxy Tor corporate VPNs
This beyond normal cookie LSO tracking plugin every time I visit website
At ANT website The source code systematically reviewed independant Mozilla contributor given public
It process every
So know safe
Part Defensive Computing knowing trust
My first question Ant
On website go way
Every computer user wary
When The Register article written Ant Video Downloader available warning
Shortly thereafter Mozilla removed extension
Now available rated experimental
After got publicized
BIGGER PICTURE Taking step back let consider bigger picture
Goodin say The larger lesson Firefox subjected Mozilla official vetting process guarantee thing many user consider invasion privacy
With least hosted site would shocking find Ant Video extension come nasty surprise
supposed insure Firefox extension clearly accurately described privacy security concern clearly spelled
Clearly vetting perfect
Also need limit Firefox
Although I developed Chrome extension I suspect situation analogous Google browser Chrome extension also spy
Ditto ActiveX control inside Internet Explorer
Heck Browser Helper Object installed IE run inside Windows Explorer even Internet Explorer shut
DEFENDING YOURSELF Obviously best defense rogue browser extension run browser extension
But want time
You may want secure browser people would want use time
Many u addicted favorite extension
The good news least Windows user cake eat
Thanks maintain two totally independent copy browser
This I occasionally kick tire Firefox still using version time
The strategy used one copy Firefox chock full extension another one unsullied
While single copy Windows host one normally installed instance Firefox also host one portable edition
The restriction one run one time
I using portable edition Firefox long I see need normally installed copy
Not I like flexibility version available I fact I backup browser copy PCs
The exact strategy also employed using gotcha
While portable edition Firefox exactly way normally installed copy true portable Chrome
Frankly keeping portable copy Chrome date patch pain
There two approach neither consistent way normally installed copy Chrome update
For entirely different approach check program see every network connection computer outside world
CurrPorts free portable bit techie
It run pretty much every version Windows XP Server Server Vista even NT ME come bit edition
The problem many web page include ad tracking domain making sense connection difficult
In screen shot see connection used Computerworld home page
Of course even portable browser extension track via legacy cooky Flash cooky storage
Perhaps best defense run browser Sandboxie sandbox
Highly recommended I recently

I know get basename file java ANT build tool case I want change name file include build version number
Unfortunately file name get set another ant script android system I importing I able set property file imported script complain property set already
Thus property holding I want change value would I
I know I put start filename basename probably I I rather way
Form Task determine basename specified file optionally minus specified suffix

In technique solving computational problem reduced finding good path
This algorithm member family method constitutes optimization
Initially proposed PhD thesis first algorithm aiming search optimal path graph based behavior seeking path source food
The original idea since diversified solve wider class numerical problem result several problem emerged drawing various aspect behavior ant
From broader perspective ACO performs search share similarity
In natural world ant specie initially wander upon finding food return colony laying trail
If ant find path likely keep travelling random instead follow trail returning reinforcing eventually find food see
Over time however pheromone trail start evaporate thus reducing attractive strength
The time take ant travel path back time pheromone evaporate
A short path comparison get marched frequently thus pheromone density becomes higher shorter path longer one
Pheromone evaporation also advantage avoiding convergence locally optimal solution
If evaporation path chosen first ant would tend excessively attractive following one
In case exploration solution space would constrained
The influence pheromone evaporation real ant system unclear important artificial system
The overall result one ant find good short path colony food source ant likely follow path eventually lead ant following single path
The idea ant colony algorithm mimic behavior simulated ant walking around graph representing problem solve
Here popular variation ACO algorithm
The global best solution deposit pheromone every iteration along ant
Added maximum minimum pheromone amount τ τ
Only global best iteration best tour deposited pheromone MAZ
All edge initialized τ reinitialized τ nearing stagnation
It presented
All solution ranked according length
The amount pheromone deposited weighted solution solution shorter path deposit pheromone solution longer path
The pheromone deposit mechanism COAC enable ant search solution collaboratively effectively
By using orthogonal design method ant feasible domain explore chosen region rapidly efficiently enhanced global search capability accuracy
The orthogonal design method adaptive radius adjustment method also extended optimization algorithm delivering wider advantage solving practical problem
It recursive form ant system divide whole search domain several solves objective subdomains
The result subdomains compared best promoted next level
The subdomains corresponding selected result subdivided process repeated output desired precision obtained
This method tested geophysical inversion problem work well
For version algorithm possible prove convergent able find global optimum finite time
The first evidence convergence ant colony algorithm made ant system algorithm algorithm ACS MMAS
Like difficult estimate theoretical speed convergence
In Zlochin colleague showed algorithm could assimilated method
They proposed
A performance analysis continuous ant colony algorithm based various parameter suggest sensitivity convergence parameter tuning
An ant simple computational agent ant colony optimization algorithm
It iteratively construct solution problem hand
The intermediate solution referred solution state
At iteration algorithm ant move state state corresponding complete intermediate solution
Thus ant computes set feasible expansion current state iteration move one probability
For ant probability moving state state depends combination two value move computed heuristic indicating desirability move move indicating proficient past make particular move
The represents posteriori indication desirability move
Trails updated usually ant completed solution increasing decreasing level trail corresponding move part good bad solution respectively
In general th ant move state state probability amount pheromone deposited transition state parameter control influence desirability state transition knowledge typically distance parameter control influence
represent attractiveness trail level possible state transition
When ant completed solution trail updated amount pheromone deposited state transition amount pheromone deposited th ant typically given problem move corresponding arc graph cost th ant tour typically length constant
Ant colony optimization algorithm applied many combinatorial optimization problem ranging quadratic assignment folding lot derived method adapted dynamic problem real variable stochastic problem parallel implementation
It also used produce solution
They advantage approach similar problem graph may change dynamically ant colony algorithm run continuously adapt change real time
This interest urban transportation system
The first ACO algorithm called ant system aimed solve travelling salesman problem goal find shortest link series city
The general algorithm relatively simple based set ant making one possible along city
At stage ant chooses move one city another according rule To optimize form antenna ant colony algorithm used
As example considare antenna based ant colony algorithm ACO loopback unloopback vibrator The ACO algorithm used image processing image edge detection edge linking
The graph image ant traverse one pixel depositing movement ant one pixel another directed local variation image intensity value
This movement cause highest density pheromone deposited edge
The following step involved edge detection using ACO Randomly place ant image
Pheromone matrix initialized random value
The major challenge initialization process determining heuristic matrix
There various method determine heuristic matrix
For example heuristic matrix calculated based local statistic local statistic pixel position j
Where image size normalization factor calculated using following function The parameter function adjusts function respective shape
The ant movement based
The probability ant move given probability equation The pheromone matrix updated twice
step trail ant given updated step evaporation rate trail updated given equation
pheromone decay coefficient Once K ant moved fixed distance L N iteration decision whether edge based threshold T pheromone matrixτ
Threshold example calculated based
Image Edge detected using ACO The image generated using different function given equation
ACO also proven effective edge linking algorithm
With ACO algorithm shortest path graph two point A B built combination several path
It easy give precise definition algorithm ant colony definition may vary according author us
Broadly speaking ant colony algorithm regarded solution represented ant moving search space
Ants mark best solution take account previous marking optimize search
They seen algorithm using make transition
In version combinatorial problem use iterative construction solution
According author thing distinguishes ACO algorithm relative algorithm estimate distribution particle swarm optimization precisely constructive aspect
In combinatorial problem possible best solution eventually found even though ant would prove effective
Thus example Travelling salesman problem necessary ant actually travel shortest route shortest route built strongest segment best solution
However definition problematic case problem real variable structure exists
The collective behaviour remains source inspiration researcher
The wide variety algorithm optimization seeking biological system led concept general framework ant colony algorithm fit
There practice large number algorithm claiming ant colony without always sharing general framework optimization canonical ant colony COA
In practice use exchange information ant via environment principle called deemed enough algorithm belong class ant colony algorithm
This principle led author create term value organize method behavior based search food sorting larva division labour cooperative transportation

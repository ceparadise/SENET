Alfred Thompson blog teaching computer science level
Alfred high school computer science teacher year
He also taught grade computer specialist
I saw side side comparison bunch scripting language online recently
My first second reaction yuck
Now I bias bias may shared others course
But I like readable code anytime I see special character anything alphanumeric slows
This got thinking going design programming language
Are moving forward ever mean backwards sideways
Back I started programming close year ago big three programming language FORTRAN COBOL coming language called BASIC
FORTRAN short FORmula TRANSlation used mathematician math major brother learn scientist
COBOL B stand Business used business application
BASIC language spreading business
COBOL loved hated different people wordiness
But least understandable
Take loop Which one obvious
Pretend experienced programmer
BASIC Visual Basic case somewhere middle
The step counting easily understandable least
Now let take look something simple
This drive beginner crazy
What going
Sure programmer know lot beginner struggle direction operation going
Compare code COBOL Wordy
Sure least even beginner read
Now I arguing go back COBOL though honestly modern IDEs feature like Intellisence would lot easier back I typing punch card
Rather I suggesting beginner language probably wordy rather obscure English easier pick programming language mean Just fun want see different programming language really look like visit site
This Website hold collection Song programmed different programming language
Actually song represented different programming language variation
Most language look like gibberish comparison Powershell
ForEach Computer TextFile Computer That close English get scripting language
For ultimate
code google obfuscation read The Twelve Days Christmas written For language designed martian OASIS precise check XACML sometimes
Yes language
An functional language access control
Sets scale
Rich PowerShell syntax horrible
Just language read like English mean readable
So PS team response comment syntax Rich PowerShell syntax horrible
Just language read like English mean readable
PS team response comment syntax terrible Visual Basic prettiest syntax imo
What AppleScript
Tell application Finder sleep End tell WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM For WSBOTTLENUM To Step correct WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM Cobra clean syntax small bit code larger construct like class method
I guess based mistake done COBOL C running loop infinite BASIC obvious easier beginner
k VS divide giving k Can see difference number character used represent statement
It obvious used extensively code
So would like use multiply subtract Add Just one character compared word save great deal time k VS divide giving k Can see difference number character used represent statement
It obvious used extensively code
So would like use multiply subtract Add Just one character compared word save great deal time I still use COBOL every get paid dam well I might add I first started hand coded gragh paper operator entered via terminal ha day
You might laugh paid house I use php c like second language also COBOL ADA remain high like list
The COBOL example wordy eye borderline incomprehensible
It English word bizarre phrasing
Applescript poster mentioned much like English quite easy program least going experience similar Hyperscript
Beginners important learn syntax quite quickly
Clarity readability important people read lot code necessarily equate lot English word
I know one language Visual Basic little bit
I concur Alfred nearer language natural language user easier therefore better least point view With mainstream language Fortran came Cobol shortly
The today arguably Java maybe C
Not exactly brilliant progress year
For speaking programmer closeness English verbosity
BTW I remember part C popularity stemmed getting rid English nonsense Pascal DECLARE A AS ARRAY OF INTEGER nice school class type God forbid quickly start appreciate int A In end learn language type every day How example APL really screw head
This following expression generates typical set Pick lottery number six integer ranging guaranteed display sorted ascending order x My favourite English go language Revolution AKA LiveCode originally came MetaCard Apple HyperCard system designed Windows Unix Rev support three platform
Nothing like Local tFadeLimit Put Into tFadeLimit Repeat For Times Subtract From tFadeLimit Set The BlendLevel Of This Stack To tFadeLimit Wait For Tick End Repeat For window fade view
COBOL supposed usable management self documenting
The usable management part never worked
It used business environment big lpm printer
The folk developed C people programming teletypes running baud
They time wordy language
Code modern language le readable
You would want thinking read gasp
write code
It depends character used
In language like Tcl Scheme Forth syntax extremely simple
The documentation big list symbol see
code dig language syntax manual try parse
Just look symbol index
Your example good one COBOL easier someone never written code read someone trying write learn anything
What want add another subexpression
Now need learn syntax
Calling set
function easy C programmer learn newbie learn also make easy extend knowledge
WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM Yeah run block exactly
I able pretend I programmer something like wsb seems easier remember syntax look like english follow syntactical grammatical rule
Wordy stuff OK type
Most programmer still finger typist
A perform statement would take lot longer something brace parenthesis
Like language matter getting used
In GEORGE III JCL could write WE COMERR GO In long form GEORGINA WHENEVER COMMAND ERROR GOTO Initially everyone used WHENEVER version
After minute two finger typing lot swearing class magically shifted two letter acronym
Maybe need programming language long form short form mix
Hey C read WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM I would point divide giving k fine try writing COBOL might find readable longer
COBOL also feature virtually control structure utter lack class object
If want teach people Pidgin English fine teaching COBOL cripple mind irreversibly regarded capital offence Dijkstra correct
Hey C read WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM I would point divide giving k fine try writing COBOL might find readable longer
COBOL also feature virtually control structure utter lack class object
If want teach people Pidgin English fine teaching COBOL cripple mind irreversibly regarded capital offence Dijkstra correct
First let destroy first idea It readable ONLY English I speak English birth language Italian I grow speaking Spanish
Now think thousand people even use alphabet system instead Cyrillic Arabic Indian Chinese etc etc
Also limited number construct like loop symbolic structure actually make easier learn
Finally learn language want able much possible little word C oriented programmer totally hate anything longer establish code block
I think paying attention Python
It get much concise readable
N You reread C syntax THIS form code execute ZERO time abort condition checked loop entered I think comparison C bit unfair C never meant readible efficient
What would following loop look like COBOL One point totally missed language read easily debugged supported easily
Having maintaining old code number logic error high code cost detecting huge technological debt many organisation gut wrenching
Just look error article minor bit code
If non expert read supposed going code pick logic importantly BUSINESS error cheaper
COBOL intended Accountants Auditors Management review logic Programmers often understand business logic professional design software
You DO software designed
Hmmm
Did anyone catch
Your right sir
cobol seems readable
experienced programmer c style make reading faster
There another great languge
It verbose clear much way C
And programmer never wrote COBOL would miss divide
statement My previous post newbie learning programming language first time
Now enjoy writing Javascript JAVA C language might want try APL
In APL could write program would literally take hundred line C code
It would also give chance brush Greek becasue woukld probably Greek
The issue verbosity mastery
COBOL BASIC program verbose long le per line C Python program end quite inefficient
Good instruction perhaps inefficient
I always impression language curve
I learned BASIC moved C ilk I learning bit functional programming Haskell
In end moving
KWKonrad I noticed posting well
Mea culpa

ease
In readability text depends complexity vocabulary presentation aspect like
Researchers used various factor measure readability Readability simply measure easily reader distinguish individual letter character
Higher readability eas reading effort speed reader especially important high
In reader average poor reading comprehension raising readability level text mediocre good make difference success failure goal
Readability exists albeit different form
In thing programmer choice structure determine
People defined readability various way The Literacy Dictionary Jeanne Chall Edgar Dale Harry McLaughlin William DuBay
Easy reading help learning enjoyment write easy understand
While many writer speaker since ancient time used plain language century brought focus reading ease
Much research focused matching prose reading skill
This used many successful formula research government teaching publishing military medicine business
Many people many language helped
By year study readability formula professional journal validity merit
The study reading teaching
Research shown much money wasted company making text hard average reader read
There summary research see link section
Many textbook reading include pointer readability
In English professor Sherman found English sentence getting shorter
In time average sentence word long
In time word long
Sherman work established Sherman wrote Literary English short follow form standard spoken English come
No man talk worse writes man write better talk
The oral sentence clearest product million daily effort clear strong
It represents work race thousand year perfecting effective instrument communication
In Russia writer Nikolai Rubakin published study text written everyday people
From text took word thought people understood
He found main block comprehension
Starting journal age Rubakin published many article book science many subject great number new reader throughout Russia
In Rubakin view people fool
They simply poor need cheap book written level could grasp
In Harry Kitson published one first book apply psychology marketing
Kitson work showed type reader bought read type text
On reading two newspaper two magazine found short sentence length short best contributor reading ease
The earliest reading ease assessment subjective judgment termed
Formulas fully address various content purpose design visual input organization text
Text leveling commonly used rank reading ease text area reading difficulty easy identify book young child
At higher level ranking reading ease becomes difficult individual difficulty become harder identify
This led better way ass reading ease
In scientific movement education looked test measure student achievement aid curriculum development
Teachers educator long known improve reading skill beginning reading material closely match ability
psychologist much early research later taken textbook publisher
Educational psychologist Columbia University noted Russia Germany teacher used word frequency count match book student
Word skill best sign intellectual development strongest predictor reading ease
In Thorndike published contained word
It made easier teacher choose book matched class reading skill
It also provided basis future research reading ease
Until computer came along word frequency list best aid grading reading ease text
In World Book Encyclopedia listed grade level word
In Bertha Lively published first reading ease formula
They concerned junior high school science textbook many technical word
They felt teacher spent class time explaining word
They argued formula would help measure reduce vocabulary burden textbook
Their formula used five variable input six constant
For thousand word counted number unique word number word Thorndike list median index number word found list
Manually took three hour apply formula book
After study people looked formula accurate easier apply
By formula published different language
In Carleton Washburne Mabel Vogel created first modern readability formula
They validated using outside criterion correlated test score student read liked criterion book
It also first introduce variable interest concept readability
Between Alfred Lewerenz Los Angeles School District published several new formula
In Edward Thorndike published formula
He wrote word skill increased teacher introduces new word repeat often
In Patty I Painter published formula measuring vocabulary burden textbook
This last early formula used Thorndike list
During recession government invested
In published It study adult reading interest
Their book showed people read would like read
They found many reader lacked suitable reading material would liked learn reading material hard
found many adult poor reading ability due poor education
Even though long tried teach write clear readable style Bryson found rare
He wrote language result artistry people idea take trouble achieve
If simple language easy many problem would solved long ago
Bryson helped set Readability Laboratory College
Two student Irving Lorge
In Ralph Ojemann investigated adult reading skill factor directly affect reading ease cause level difficulty
He invent formula method assessing difficulty material
He first ass validity method using magazine passage tested actual reader
He evaluated measurable three reported factor affect reading ease
Ojemann emphasized reported feature whether text coherent unduly abstract
He used passage compare judge reading ease text method called
He showed even though factor measured ignored
Also published first adult reading ease formula based passage health topic variety textbook magazine
Of factor significant young reader found ten significant adult
They used three formula
In Bernice Leary published one important book readability research
Like Dale Tyler focused make book readable adult limited reading ability
Their book included first scientific study reading skill American adult
The sample included adult variety setting region
The test used number passage magazine well standard reading test
They found mean grade score eighth month
About read level grade level
The author emphasized adult population time lacked suitable reading material
They wrote For enriching value reading denied unless material reflecting adult interest adapted need
The poorest reader adult population need simpler material use promoting functioning establishing fundamental reading habit
Gray Leary analyzed variable affect reading ease divided four type They found content important followed closely style
Third format followed closely organization
They found way measure content format could measure variable style
Among significant measurable style variable selected five create formula Their formula measured reading test given adult
In Irving Lorge published article reported combination variable indicate difficulty accurately one Gray Leary used
His research also showed The vocabulary load important concomitant difficulty
In Lorge published readability formula used three variable set stage simpler reliable formula followed
By investigator In Rudolf Flesch published PhD dissertation included readability formula predict difficulty adult reading material
Investigators many field began using improve communication
One variable used name personal pronoun
Another variable
In Flesch published formula two part
Rather using grade level used scale equivalent grade equivalent grade
It dropped use affix
The second part formula predicts human interest using personal reference number personal sentence
The new formula correlated reading test
The original formula Publishers discovered Flesch formula could increase readership percent
Flesch work also made enormous impact journalism
The Flesch Reading Ease formula became one widely used one tested reliable
In Farr Jenkins Patterson simplified formula changing syllable count
The modified formula In project sponsored Navy Reading Ease formula recalculated give score
The new formula called formula
The formula one popular heavily tested formula
It correlate comprehension measured reading test
professor education Ohio State University one first critic Thorndike list
He claimed distinguish different meaning many word
He created two new list
One short list easy word used Irving Lorge formula
The long list easy word understood student
In incorporated list formula developed Jeanne Chall later founded Harvard Reading Laboratory
To apply formula Where Finally compensate curve apply following chart Final Score Correlating comprehension measured reading test formula reliable formula widely used scientific research
In Dale Chall published new version formula upgraded word list New readability formula
In Robert Gunning helped bring readability research workplace
In founded first readability consulting firm dedicated reducing fog newspaper business writing
In published Fog Index formula correlate comprehension measured reading test
The formula one reliable simplest apply In teaching English teacher Uganda Edward Fry developed
It became one popular formula easiest apply
The Fry Graph correlate comprehension measured reading test
Harry McLaughlin determined word length sentence length multiplied rather added formula
In published SMOG Simple Measure Gobbledygook formula The SMOG formula correlate comprehension measured reading test
It often recommended use healthcare
In study commissioned US military reading skill required different military job produced FORCAST formula
Unlike formula us vocabulary element making useful text without complete sentence
The formula satisfied requirement would The formula The FORCAST formula correlate comprehension measured reading test
Several study showed even small increase readability greatly increase readership newspaper
In Donald Murphy used edition study effect making text easier read
They found reducing level increased readership article
There gain reader circulation
He found increase readership article
He also found better response people
Wilber Schramm interviewed newspaper reader
He found easier reading style help decide much article read
This called reading persistence depth perseverance
He also found people read le long article short one
A story paragraph long lose three reader paragraph
A shorter story lose two
Schramm also found use subhead paragraph star break story actually lose reader
A study Melvin Lostutter showed newspaper generally written level five year ability average American adult reader
He also found reading ease newspaper article little education experience personal interest journalist writing story
It convention culture industry
Lostutter argued readability testing newspaper writing
He wrote improved readability must conscious process somewhat independent education experience staff A study Charles Swanson showed better readability increase total number paragraph read number reader reading every paragraph
In Bernard Feld study every item ad November
He divided item level grade
He chose breakpoint average reading level adult reader
An text reach percent American wrote
Among story lower group got reader among local story percent reader
Feld also believed drilling writer Flesch principle
Both Rudolf Flesch Robert Gunning worked extensively newspaper wire service improving readability
Mainly effort year readability US newspaper went level remains today
The two publication largest circulation million million written level
The popular novel written level
This support fact average adult read level
It also show recreation people read text two grade actual reading level
George Klare colleague looked effect greater reading ease Air Force recruit
They found readable text resulted greater complete learning
They also increased amount read given time made easier acceptance
Other study Klare showed reader skill prior knowledge interest motivation affect reading ease
For century teacher educator seen importance organization coherence emphasis good writing
Beginning cognitive theorist began teaching reading really act thinking organization
The reader construct meaning mixing new knowledge existing knowledge
Because limit reading ease formula research looked way measure content organization coherence text
Although improve reliability formula effort showed importance variable reading ease
Studies others showed central role coherence reading ease mainly people learning read
In Kemper devised formula based physical state mental state
However found better word familiarity sentence length showing reading ease
Bonnie Meyer others tried use organization measure reading ease
While result formula showed people read faster retain text organized topic
She found visible plan presenting content greatly help reader ass text
A hierarchical plan show part text related
It also aid reader blending new information existing knowledge structure
Bonnie Armbruster found important feature learning comprehension textual coherence come two type Armbruster confirmed Kintsch finding coherence structure help younger reader
Calfee Curley built Bonnie Meyer work found unfamiliar underlying structure make even simple text hard read
They brought graded system help student progress simpler story line advanced abstract one
Many study looked effect reading ease text variable including John Bormuth University Chicago looked reading ease using new developed Wilson Taylor
His work supported earlier research including degree reading ease kind reading
The best level classroom assisted reading slightly difficult text cause set learn reader correctly answer percent question test
The best level unassisted reading one reader correctly answer percent question
These cutoff score later confirmed Vygotsky Chall Conard
Among thing Bormuth confirmed vocabulary sentence length best indicator reading ease
He showed measure reading ease worked well adult child
The thing child find hard adult reading level
He also developed several new measure cutoff score
One well known used produce system used College Entrance Examination Board
In Jack Stenner associate MetaMetrics published new system assessing readability matching student appropriate text
The Lexile framework us average sentence length average word frequency American Heritage Intermediate Corpus predict score scale
The AHI Corpus includes five million word published work often read student grade three nine
The Lexile Book Database title publisher
By knowing student Lexile score teacher find book match reading level
In researcher School Renaissance Institute Touchstone Applied Science Associates published Open Standard ATOS Reading ease Formula Books
They worked formula easy use could used text
The project one widest reading ease project ever
The developer formula used normed reading text million word text book read student
The project also used reading record read tested book
They found three variable give reliable measure text reading ease They also found used many different way investigate cohesion explicit text coherence mental representation text
Our definition consists characteristic explicit text play role helping reader mentally connect idea text
The definition coherence subject much debate
Theoretically coherence text defined interaction linguistic representation knowledge representation
While coherence defined characteristic text aspect cohesion likely contribute coherence mental representation measurement provide index cohesion characteristic
While expert agree formula highly accurate grading readability existing text useful creating modifying
The two variable used formula sentence vocabulary one directly related reading difficulty one
Writing expert warned attempt simplify text changing length word sentence may result text difficult read
All variable tightly related
If one changed others must also adjusted including approach voice person tone typography design organization
Writing class reader one difficult
It take training method practice
Among good writer novel child book
The writing expert advise besides using formula observe norm good writing essential writing readable text
Writers study text used audience reading habit
This mean audience writer study learn good quality material

In invented concept storing form
Later plugboard added Type I Tabulator allowed programmed different job late programmed control panel similar way first
However concept introduced program data stored manipulated way
crucial role computer programming beginning first computer programmer woman quotation needed
Computer programming considered many assumed coding process trivial mechanical work could given woman
Soon female became involved intellectual process originally done male planner
In computer company like began make computer
While could could
Companies became need solve varied complex problem
This began new appreciation programmer increased demand service went hand hand rise salary This boost status pay computer programmer attracted lot men computer programming
language early program written particular machine often notation
soon developed let programmer specify instruction text format ADD X TOTAL abbreviation operation code meaningful name specifying address
However assembly language little different notation machine language two machine also different assembly language
allow programmer write program term le bound underlying hardware
They harness power computer make programming easier allowing programmer specify calculation entering formula directly
first widely used language functional implementation came many language soon developed particular aimed commercial data processing computer research
Programs mostly still entered using punched card
See
By late became inexpensive enough program could created typing directly computer
developed allowed change correction made much easily punched card
Whatever approach development may final program must satisfy fundamental property
The following property among important In computer programming refers ease human reader comprehend purpose operation source code
It affect aspect quality including portability usability importantly maintainability
Readability important programmer spend majority time reading trying understand modifying existing source code rather writing new source code
Unreadable code often lead bug inefficiency
A study found simple readability transformation made code shorter drastically reduced time understand
Following consistent often help readability
However readability programming style
Many factor little nothing ability computer efficiently compile execute code contribute readability
Some factor include The aspect indent line break color highlighting often handled content aspect reflect programmer talent skill
Various also developed intent resolve readability concern adopting approach code structure display
IDEs aim integrate help
Techniques like enhance readability
The academic field engineering practice computer programming largely concerned discovering implementing efficient algorithm given class problem
For purpose algorithm classified using express resource use execution time memory consumption term size input
Expert programmer familiar variety algorithm respective complexity use knowledge choose algorithm best suited circumstance
The first step formal software development process requirement analysis followed testing determine value modeling implementation failure elimination debugging
There exist lot differing approach task
One approach popular analysis
Many programmer use form various stage formal software development integrated together short cycle take week rather year
There many approach Software development process
Popular modeling technique include Analysis Design Architecture
The Unified Modeling Language notation used OOAD MDA
A similar technique used database design Modeling
Implementation technique include imperative language
It difficult determine popular modern programming language
Methods measuring programming language popularity include counting number job advertisement mention language number book sold course teaching language overestimate importance newer language estimate number existing line code written language underestimate number user business language COBOL
Some language popular particular kind application language regularly used write many different kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large engineering application development
Many application use mix several language construction use
New language generally designed around syntax prior language new functionality added example add C Java add memory management result loses efficiency ability manipulation
Debugging important task software development process since defect program significant consequence user
Some language prone kind fault specification require compiler perform much checking language
Use tool help detect possible problem
Normally first step debugging attempt reproduce problem
This task example parallel process unusual software bug
Also specific user environment usage history make difficult reproduce problem
After bug reproduced input program may need simplified make easier debug
For example bug compiler make crash parsing large source file
However simplification test case line original source file sufficient reproduce crash
Such simplification done manually using approach
The programmer try remove part original test case check problem still exists
When debugging problem GUI programmer try skip user interaction original problem description check remaining action sufficient bug appear
Debugging often done like
Standalone debugger like also used often provide le visual environment usually using
Some text editor allow GDB invoked provide visual environment
Different programming language support different style programming called
The choice language used subject many consideration company policy suitability task availability package individual preference
Ideally programming language best suited task hand selected
ideal involve finding enough programmer know language build team availability compiler language efficiency program written given language execute
Languages form approximate spectrum language typically faster execute whereas language abstract easier use execute le quickly
It usually easier code language one

Learn something new every day email Readability refers easy written text read
Generally readability broken two factor well text laid visually easily word sentence understood
Good writing highly readable order clearly understood wide audience
The first characteristic readability pertains visual layout word page screen
The visual readability text effected typeset length line word spacing visual factor
Researchers use several method test readability generally involving human participant rather mathematical formula
These test may measure well participant able read material short period time distance peripheral vision
Other method include recording eye movement blink rate participant order measure
The second factor involves easy text understand mentally visually
A number characteristic readable text identified notably syllable per word word per sentence uncommon word
These objective factor calculated use number readability test Gunning Fog index formula
Such test often score readability based number year school would required understand text
For example text scored Gunning Fog index could probably read understood someone completed six year formal education
Some study used measure either type readability
For instance rate work study measure quickly participant able read understand text
Quantifying fatigue may also physical mental component
In addition measurable characteristic readable writing researcher include subjective factor interest
For example person find piece writing interesting likely retain information
Although interest difficult quantify mathematically study indicated test participant read quickly rate material interesting
Improving readability often matter breaking long complicated sentence shorter one substituting simple word unnecessarily complex one
It still important vary sentence length word choice hold reader attention
Although research done quantify make text readable good writing remains much art science
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

The POA process consists four main activity repeat every semester During phase Assessment Committee decides outcome assessed
The Assessment Schedule dictate every outcome assessed least every two year In addition Assessment Committee might also decide reassess certain outcome
Assessment Schedule follow
Course Assessment Semester CS X X CS X X X CS X X CS X X Regardless outcome assessed instructor assessed class submit TARs also called Performance Indicators Rubrics section taught
These report submitted course coordinator responsible archiving
If outcome x scheduled assessed given semester coordinator assessed class enable outcome according must submit Outcome Assessment Report OAR Assessment Committee end semester
The OAR based relevant TARs collected since last assessment outcome
The OAR also contains coordinator analysis data recommendation
The Assessment Committee publishes OAR within two month end semester
The OAR based CARs submitted
In case one course assessed given outcome OAR may summarize corresponding CAR
The OAR may contain recommendation
In many case OAR recommendation take form minor pedagogical change minor change course content
These recommendation recorded Teaching Tips section course
The course coordinator make sure instructor made aware recommendation
Sometimes OAR recommendation take form policy curricular change
These change discussed department monthly

The assessment standard provide criterion judge progress toward science education vision scientific literacy
The standard describe quality assessment practice used teacher state federal agency measure student achievement opportunity provided student learn science
By identifying essential characteristic exemplary assessment practice standard serve guide developing assessment task practice policy
These standard applied equally assessment student teacher program summative formative assessment practice classroom assessment well external assessment
This chapter begin introduction describes component assessment process contemporary view measurement theory practice
This introduction followed assessment standard discussion way teacher use assessment characteristic assessment conducted district state national level
The chapter close two sample assessment task one probe student understanding natural world another probe ability inquire
In vision described assessment primary feedback mechanism science education system
For example assessment data provide student feedback well meeting expectation teacher parent teacher feedback well student learning district feedback effectiveness teacher program policy maker feedback well policy working
Feedback lead change science education system stimulating change policy guiding teacher professional development encouraging student improve understanding science
The assessment process effective tool communicating expectation science education system concerned science education
Assessment practice policy provide operational definition important
For example use extended inquiry assessment task signal student learn teacher teach resource allocated
Assessment systematic multistep process involving collection interpretation educational data
The four component assessment process detailed
As science educator changing way think good science education educational measurement specialist acknowledging change well
Recognition importance assessment contemporary educational reform catalyzed research development implementation new method data collection along new way judging data quality
These change measurement theory practice reflected assessment standard
In new view assessment learning two side coin
The method used collect educational data define measurable term teacher teach student learn
And student engage assessment exercise learn
This view assessment place greater confidence result assessment procedure sample assortment variable using diverse method rather traditional sampling one variable single method
Thus aspect science inquire scientific understanding natural world understanding nature utility measured using multiple method performance portfolio well conventional test
The assessment standard include increased emphasis measurement Figure
Components Assssment Process The four component combined numerous way
For example teacher use student achievement data plan modify teaching practice business leader use per caput educational expenditure locate business
The variety us user method data contributes complexity importance assessment process
opportunity learn
Student achievement interpreted light quality program experienced
Another important shift toward assessment
This movement call exercise closely approximate intended outcome science education
Authentic assessment exercise require student apply scientific knowledge reasoning situation similar encounter world outside classroom well situation approximate scientist work
Another conceptual shift within educational measurement area significant implication science assessment involves validity
Validity must concerned technical quality educational data also social educational consequence data interpretation
An important assumption underlying assessment standard state local district develop mechanism measure student achievement specified content standard measure opportunity learning science specified program system standard
If principle assessment standard followed information resulting new mode assessment applied locally common meaning value term national standard despite use different assessment procedure instrument different locale
This contrast traditional view educational measurement allows comparison based parallel form test
Assessments deliberately designed
Assessments explicitly stated purpose
The relationship decision data clear
Assessment procedure internally consistent
The essential characteristic assessment process used collect interpret data consistent purpose assessment
That match purpose process achieved thoughtful planning available public review
Educational data profoundly influence life student well people institution responsible science education
People must use result assessment make decision take action well affected decision action deserve assurance assessment carefully conceptualized
Evidence careful conceptualization found written plan assessment contain Statements purpose assessment serve
Descriptions substance technical quality data collected
Specifications number student school data obtained
Descriptions method
Descriptions method data interpretation
Descriptions decision made including make decision procedure
Conducting assessment activity
Routine assessment classroom place considerable demand time intellectual resource teacher student
assessment conducted district state federal government require tremendous human fiscal expenditure
Such resource expended assurance decision action follow increase scientific literacy assurance made purpose assessment clear
Assessments test assumption relationship among educational variable
For example purpose decide school district management system continued assessment data might collected student achievement
This choice assessment would based following assumed relationship management system give teacher responsibility selecting science program teacher incentive implement effectively program select effective implementation improves science achievement
The relationship decision made data collected specified
For assessment internally consistent component must consistent others
A link inference must established reasonable alternative explanation eliminated
For example district management example relationship management system student achievement adequately tested student achievement variable measured
The extent management system increased teacher responsibility led change science program could influence science achievement must also measured
Achievement data collected focus science content important student learn
data collected focus powerful indicator
Equal attention must given assessment opportunity learn assessment student achievement
The content standard define science student come understand
They portray outcome science education rich varied encompassing The ability inquire
Knowing understanding scientific fact concept principle law theory
Standards The Physical Science Content Standard includes understanding motion force
One supporting idea motion object described change position time
Students respond question frame reference extended written response diagram
This individual extended response exercise embedded teaching
The teacher us information activity improve lesson
Students written response
Teacher observation
A class studying motion object
One student describing idea motion force point book desk say right book moving
A second student interrupt Oh yes
The book desk desk floor floor part building building sitting Earth Earth rotating axis revolving around Sun whole solar system moving Milky Way
The second student sits back smile face
All discussion cease
signal time pose following question class
Imagine insect spider lily pad floating stream
The spider walking around edge lily pad
The insect sitting middle pad watching spider
How would insect describe motion
How would insect describe spider motion
How would bird sitting edge stream describe motion insect spider
After setting class work discussing question teacher walk around room listening discussion
asks student write answer question posed suggests student use diagram part response
The school principal observing class asked explain followed original lesson plan
explained girl made similar statement class twice
realized girl disruptive making legitimate point member class grasping
So decided continuing discussion motion force would fruitful class developed better concept frame reference
Her question designed help student realize motion described term point reference
The insect middle lily pad would describe motion motion spider term reference frame lily pad
In contrast bird watching edge stream would describe motion lily pad passenger term reference frame namely ground standing
Someone ground observing bird would say bird motion observer moon would different answer
The ability reason scientifically
The ability use science make personal decision take position societal issue
The ability communicate effectively science
This assessment standard highlight complexity content standard addressing importance collecting data aspect student science achievement
Educational measurement theory practice well developed primarily measure student knowledge subject matter therefore many educator policy analyst confidence instrument designed measure student command information science instrument designed measure student understanding natural world ability inquire
Many current science achievement test measure inert isolated bit active rich
Assessment process include outcome student achievement must probe extent organization student knowledge
Rather checking whether student memorized certain item information assessment need probe student understanding reasoning utilization knowledge
Assessment learning closely related outcome assessed teacher student likely redefine expectation learning science outcome assessed
The system program teaching professional development standard portray condition must exist throughout science education system student opportunity learn science
At classroom level powerful indicator opportunity learn teacher professional knowledge including content knowledge pedagogical knowledge understanding student extent content teaching professional development assessment coordinated time available teacher teach student learn science availability resource student inquiry quality educational material available
The teaching program standard define greater detail indicator opportunity learn
Some indicator opportunity learn origin federal state district level discussed greater detail system standard
Other powerful indicator opportunity learn beyond classroom include educational expenditure state science requirement graduation federal allocation fund state
Compelling indicator opportunity learn continually identified way collect data designed
Measuring indicator present many technical theoretical economic social challenge challenge obviate responsibility moving forward implementing assessing opportunity learn
The assessment standard call commitment resource necessary research development related assessing opportunity learn
That commitment includes development technical skill ass opportunity learn among science education professional including teacher supervisor administrator curriculum developer
Students held accountable achievement unless given adequate opportunity learn science
Therefore achievement opportunity learn science must assessed equally
The feature claimed measured actually measured
Assessment task authentic
An individual student performance similar two task claim measure aspect student achievement
Students adequate opportunity demonstrate achievement
Assessment task method presenting provide data sufficiently stable lead decision used different time
Standard C address degree data collected warrant decision action based
The quality decision appropriateness resulting action limited quality data
The serious consequence student teacher greater confidence making decision must technical quality data
Confidence gauged quality assessment process consistency measurement alternative assessment process
Judgments confidence based several different indicator discussed
The content form assessment task must congruent supposed measured
This validity
For instance assessment claim measure student ability frame question conducting scientific inquiry design inquiry address question format would appropriate task
Requiring student pose question design inquiry address would appropriate task
However purpose assessment task measure student knowledge characteristic distinguish group mineral format might suitable well efficient
When student engaged assessment task similar form task engage life outside classroom similar activity scientist great confidence attached data collected
Such assessment task authentic
Classroom assessment take many form including observation student performance instructional activity interview formal performance task portfolio investigative project written report multiple choice essay examination
The relationship form assessment task goal science education obvious others
For instance student ability obtain evaluate scientific information might measured using test identify source scientific information toxic waste
An alternative authentic method ask student locate information develop annotated bibliography judgment scientific quality information
This one aspect reliability
Suppose purpose assessment measure student ability pose appropriate question
A student might asked pose question situation set physical science
The student performance task consistent performance task set context life science assuming student equal opportunity learn physical life science
For decision maker confidence assessment data need assurance student opportunity demonstrate full understanding ability
Assessment task must developmentally appropriate must set context familiar student must require reading skill vocabulary inappropriate student grade level must free bias possible
This another aspect reliability especially important assessment change performance group interest
Only stable measure valid inference change group performance made
Although confidence indicator discussed focus student achievement data analogous set confidence indicator generated opportunity learn
For instance teacher quality indicator opportunity learn
Authenticity obtained teacher quality measured systematic observation teaching performance qualified observer
Confidence measure achieved number observation large enough teacher exhibit full range teaching knowledge skill
Consistency performance also established repeated observation
method take many form
Each advantage disadvantage
The choice among usually constrained tradeoff type quality amount information gained time resource requires
However serve intended purpose choice assessment form consistent one want measure infer
It critical data method collection yield information confidence level consistent consequence use
Public confidence educational data use related technical quality
This public confidence influenced extent technical quality considered educator policy maker skill communicate public
Assessment task must reviewed use stereotype assumption reflect perspective experience particular group language might offensive particular group feature might distract student intended task
assessment must use statistical technique identify potential bias among subgroup
Assessment task must appropriately modified accommodate need student physical disability learning disability limited English proficiency
Assessment task must set variety context engaging student different interest experience must assume perspective experience particular gender racial ethnic group
A premise student access quality science education expected achieve scientific literacy defined content standard
It follows process used ass student achievement must fair student
This ethical requirement also measurement requirement
If assessment result closely related gender ethnicity preparation received science understanding ability assessed validity assessment process questionable
Those plan implement science assessment must pay deliberate attention issue fairness
The concern fairness reflected procedure used develop assessment task content language assessment task process student assessed analysis assessment result
Statistical technique require sex different racial ethnic background included development assessment
Bias determined certainty combination statistical evidence expert judgment
For instance exercise ass understanding inertia using flywheel result differential performance female male judgment exercise biased might plausible based assumption male female different experience flywheel
Whether assessment large scale teacher conducted principle fairness requires method allow student physical disability learning disability limited English proficiency demonstrate full extent science knowledge skill
The requirement assessment exercise authentic thus context increase likelihood task degree bias population student
Some context appeal male others female
If however assessment employ variety task collection equally unfair
This one way deleterious effect bias avoided
When making inference assessment data student achievement opportunity learn science explicit reference need made assumption inference based
Even assessment well planned quality resulting data high interpretation empirical evidence result quite different conclusion
Making inference involves looking empirical data lens theory personal belief personal experience
Making objective inference extremely difficult partly individual always aware assumption
Consequently confidence validity inference requires explicit reference assumption inference based
For example science achievement assessment sample student certain population high several conclusion possible
Students population might highly motivated excellent instruction student population might greater opportunity learn science test might biased way favor student
Little confidence placed conclusion without clear statement assumption developed line reasoning evidence conclusion
The level confidence conclusion raised conducting assessment well trained process making inference educational assessment data
Even general public well professional demand open understandable description inference made
Teachers best position put assessment data powerful use
In vision science education described teacher use assessment data many way
Some way teacher might use data presented section
Teachers collect information student understanding almost continuously make adjustment teaching basis interpretation information
They observe critical incident classroom formulate hypothesis cause incident question student test hypothesis interpret student response adjust teaching plan
Teachers use assessment data plan curriculum
Some data teacher collected data come external source
The data used select content activity example incorporated course study module unit lesson
Teachers use assessment data make judgment The developmental appropriateness science content
Student interest content
The effectiveness activity producing desired learning outcome
The effectiveness selected example
The understanding ability student must benefit selected activity example
Planning assessment integral instruction
Assessments embedded curriculum serve least three purpose determine student initial understanding ability monitor student progress collect information grade student achievement
Assessment task used purpose reflect student expected learn elicit full extent student understanding set variety context practical aesthetic heuristic value meaning outside classroom
assessment task also provide important clue student important learn
Students need opportunity evaluate reflect scientific understanding ability
Before student need understand goal learning science
The ability understanding essential tool learning
Through student clarify idea supposed learn
They begin internalize expectation learn science
Developing skill ongoing process throughout student school career becoming increasingly sophisticated student progress
Conversations among teacher student assessment task teacher evaluation performance provide student necessary information ass work
In concert opportunity apply individual work work peer information contributes development student skill
By developing skill student become able take responsibility learning
Teachers communicated assessment practice standard performance criterion evaluation student student able Select piece work provide evidence understanding scientific concept principle ability conduct scientific inquiry
Explain orally writing illustration work sample provides evidence understanding
Critique sample work using teacher standard criterion quality
Critique work student constructive way
Involving student assessment process increase responsibility teacher
Teachers science representative scientific community classroom represent culture way thinking might quite unfamiliar student
As representative teacher expected model reflection fostering learning environment student review others work offer suggestion challenge mistake investigative process faulty reasoning poorly supported conclusion
A teacher formal informal evaluation student work exemplify scientific practice making judgment
The standard judging significance soundness creativity work professional scientific work complex arbitrary
In work classroom learning investigation teacher represent standard practice scientific community
When teacher treat student serious learner serve coach rather judge student come understand apply standard good scientific practice
An essential responsibility teacher report student progress achievement student colleague parent policy maker
Progress report provide information The teacher performance standard criterion evaluation
A student progress marking period marking period form year year
A student progress mastering science curriculum
A student achievement measured criterion
Each issue requires different kind information different mode assessment
Especially challenging teacher communicating parent policy maker new method gathering information gaining acceptance school
Parents policy maker need reassured newer method good better used school
Thus developing plan assessment strategy compile evidence student achievement teacher demonstrate alternative form data collection method interpreting valid reliable familiar test
The purported objectivity test highly valued newer mode assessment portfolio performance essay rely apparently subjective scoring method le trusted people professional educator
Overcoming lack trust requires teacher use assessment plan monitoring student progress grading
Clearly relating assessment task product student work valued goal science education integral assessment plan
Equally important plan explicit criterion judging quality student work policy maker parent understand
Master teacher engage practical inquiry teaching identify condition promote student learning understand certain practice effective
The teacher researcher engages assessment activity similar scientific inquiry collecting data answer question effective teaching practice
Engaging classroom research mean teacher develop assessment plan involve collecting data student opportunity learn well achievement
Science assessment conducted district state national authority serve similar purpose distinguished primarily number student teacher school data collected
Assessments may conducted authority external classroom purpose Formulating policy
Monitoring effect policy
Enforcing compliance policy
Demonstrating accountability
Making comparison
Monitoring progress toward goal
In addition purpose assessment conducted school district make judgment effectiveness specific program school teacher report taxpayer district accomplishment
The high cost external assessment influence science teaching practice demand careful planning implementation
assessment include teacher planning implementation
In addition data collected analyzed sample size well rationalized sample representative population interest
This section discus characteristic assessment
Far often educational data collected analyzed used make decision take action
assessment planner able describe data plan collect used improve science education
The development interpretation externally designed assessment monitoring educational system include active participation teacher
Teachers experience student make indispensable participant design development interpretation assessment prepared beyond classroom
Their involvement help ensure congruence classroom practice science education external assessment practice
Whether district state national level teacher science need work others make contribution assessment process educational researcher educational measurement specialist curriculum specialist educational policy analyst
The size sample data collected depends purpose assessment number student teacher school district state assessment plan address
If instance state conduct assessment learn student science achievement comparison student another state sufficient obtain data scientifically defined sample student state
If however purpose assessment give credit individual student science course data must collected every student
For assessment even district level information collected way minimize time demand individual student
For many accountability purpose sampling design employed different representative sample student receiving different set task
This permit many different dimension science education system monitored
Policy maker taxpayer make valid inference student achievement opportunity learn across nation state district without requiring extensive time commitment every student sample
To illustrate assessment standard two example provided
The content standard stated term understanding ability therefore first example understanding natural world
This example requires body scientific knowledge competence reason information make prediction develop explanation act scientifically rational way
The example focus prediction justifying prediction
The second example ability inquire also requires body scientific information competence reason conceptualize plan perform investigation
These assessment task content standard correspondence
The content standard call scientific understanding natural world
Such understanding requires knowing concept principle law theory physical life earth science well idea common across natural science
That understanding includes capacity reason knowledge
Discerning student know student reason possible without communication either verbal representational third essential component understanding
Inferences student understanding based analysis performance science classroom work product
Types performance include making class public presentation discussing science matter peer teacher conducting laboratory work
Products student work include examina tions journal note written report diagram data set physical mathematical model collection natural object
Communication fundamental performance assessment
Understanding take different perspective displayed different level sophistication
A physicist understanding respiration might quite different chemist cell biologist understanding respiration quite different physician
The physicist chemist biologist physician highly sophisticated understanding respiration
They bring many scientific principle bear concept
However likely give greater emphasis concept special significance particular discipline
A physicist emphasis might energetics little emphasis organism respiration take place
The physician hand might emphasize respiration specifically applies human
The context application also contributes difference perspective
The cell biologist understanding might focus mechanism respiration occurs cell physician understanding might focus human respiratory disorder physical pathological cause
An ordinary citizen understanding respiration much le sophisticated practicing scientist
However even citizen understanding different perspective reflecting difference experience exposure science
Legitimate difference perspective sophistication understanding also evident student scientific understanding natural world
A challenge teacher others responsible assessing understanding decide variability translated judgment degree individual student group understand natural world
The example follows illustrates explanation natural world rich source information student understand
Because explanation central scientific enterprise eliciting analyzing explanation useful way assessing science achievement
The example illustrates thoughtfully designed assessment exercise requiring explanation provide student opportunity demonstrate full range scientific understanding
Exercises sort designed learn whether student know particular fact concept rather tap depth breadth student understanding
Exercises sort difficult design challenge score
The example follows illustrates challenge
The assessment task begin prompt includes description task direction
The prompt read Many attribute make jar good exercise assessing understanding
The situation plant closed jar described student verbally diagram actual material thus eliminating reading barrier student response
The situation understood student age minimizing student prior knowledge situation factor ability respond
The explanation prediction developed many different level complexity qualitative quantitative
It based experience theory us idea physical life earth science well idea thus allowing student demonstrate full range understanding science various level study science
The process scoring explanation requires development scoring rubric
The rubric standard performance defined population
Typically scoring rubric developed teacher student target population
The performance standard developed consensus process called social moderation
The step designing scoring rubric involve defining performance standard scientifically literate adult deciding element standard appropriate student target population
The draft performance standard refined subsequent use student performance work
Finally student performance respect rubric differentiated
Performances rated satisfactory exemplary inadequate
Differences opinion rubric judgment quality student response moderated group teacher consensus reached rubric
Because target population identified rubric need function community develop section define rubric
Rather step developing rubric described
Developing scoring rubric begin description performance standard scientifically literate adult
That performance standard developed rubric development team
Members team write individual response exercise reflect belief scientifically literate adult respond
They also seek response adult
Based individual response team negotiates team response serf initial standard
The team standard analyzed component response
In exercise component prediction information used justify prediction reasoning used justify prediction quality communication
Examples prediction scientifically literate adult long plant live jar might include insufficient information make prediction plant live indefinitely insect disease might kill plant
Whatever prediction justified
For example assertion made information provided prompt insufficient make prediction explanation describe information needed make prediction information would used
Scientifically literate adult rely range knowledge justify prediction
The standard response developed team teacher include concept physical life earth science well unifying concept science
All applicable making justifying prediction life plant jar difference emphasis one person would expected use
Some concept evaporation condensation energy including heat light chemical energy conversion energy transmission chemical interaction catalysis conservation mass dynamic equilibrium physical science
Other concept life science plant physiology plant growth photosynthesis respiration plant disease plant insect interaction
Still concept earth science soil type composition atmosphere water cycle solar energy mineral cycle
Finally unifying concept might used predict justify prediction plant jar
Those might include closed open isolated system physical model pattern change conservation equilibrium
The knowledge required predict life plant jar limited single concept
A deeper understanding phenomenon could implied justification includes knowledge chemical specie energy
Keeping track energy C H O sugar CO carbon dioxide H O water O oxygen mineral requires knowing change undergo jar equilibrium among zone jar soil atmosphere
The jar content form closed system respect matter open system respect energy
The analysis life expectancy plant jar also requires knowing matter jar change form mass remains constant
In addition knowing gas atmosphere mineral soil become part plant important explanation
A deeper understanding science might inferred prediction justification included knowledge physical chemistry photosynthesis respiration
Photosynthesis process radiant energy visible light converted chemical bond energy form special carrier molecule ATP turn used store chemical bond energy carbohydrate
The process begin light absorption chlorophyll pigment give plant green color
In photosynthesis light energy used drive reaction Respiration process energy released chemical compound react oxygen
In respiration sugar broken produce useful chemical energy plant reaction Photosynthesis respiration complementary process photosynthesis result storage energy respiration release
Photosynthesis remove CO atmosphere respiration add CO atmosphere
A justification prediction life plant jar might include knowledge dynamic equilibrium
Equilibrium exists liquid vapor state water
The liquid water evaporates continuously
In closed container constant temperature rate condensation equal rate evaporation
The water state dynamic equilibrium
Another attribute justification relates assumption
The justification explicit assumption underlie even contain speculation concerning implication making alternative assumption
Finally justification prediction plant jar demonstrates reasoning characterized succession statement follow one another logically without gap statement statement
The assessment exercise appropriate prompt understanding plant grade level
Development scoring rubric student different grade level requires consideration science experience developmental level student
For instance justification student elementary school could expected based primarily experience plant
Student justification would contain little scientific terminology
A student might respond exercise following way Expectations justification constructed student grade different
These contain generalized knowledge use sophisticated language scientific concept light heat oxygen carbon dioxide energy photosynthesis
By grade level sophistication much higher
Ideally grader would see plant jar physical model Earth ecosystem view photosynthesis respiration complementary process
Setting performance standard population student depends population developmental level experience science
Considerations made using student response developing rubric illustrated discussing two justification constructed student completed biology
Student E constructed exemplary justification prediction plant jar
Student S constructed le satisfactory response completely missed point
O incomplete vaporization
This would shut root hair pressure plant allows water nutrient reach leaf
All plant live long day downhill
Judging quality information contained justification requires consensus information contained using certain standard compare information information rubric
Standards might applied include scientific accuracy information justification appropriateness knowledge student age experience sophistication knowledge appropriateness application knowledge situation
Foremost judgment quality information contained justification take account accuracy information student used crafting response
Student S justification contains misinformation water cycle dynamic equilibrium closed system
The statement inference made moisture soil likely start evaporate almost immediately
This leave soil dry air humid
Since closed container water restored soil condensation
The student statement soil container dry air humid suggests lack knowledge equilibrium closed system
In contrast Student S misinformation Student E justification contains information neither unusually sophisticated viewed content biology text erroneous
Judgments appropriateness information difficult make
A person familiar biology course student took might assert information student response sophisticated taught course
In case content biology course used standard rating quality response
Alternatively standard rating appropriateness information might scientific idea content standard
Student E response rated higher Student S basis quality information
Student S justification provides information student know provides evidence making inference structure student knowledge
For example student consider complementary relationship photosynthesis respiration crafting justification
Perhaps student know respiration process complementary
Alternatively two concept may stored memory way facilitate bringing bear exercise
Testing plausibility inference student knowledge structure would require conversation student
To learn student know respiration one simply ask
If student know apply making prediction evidence respiration understood context life process plant
Student E response well structured consistent prediction
The statement form connected progression
The prediction tentative justification indicates tentative due lack information prompt student uncertainty quantitative detail condition photosynthesis respiration occur
The student explicit certain assumption instance relationship mineral soil plant growth
The question student pose justification interpreted evidence alternative assumption considered
In contrast Student S prediction stated unwarranted assurance justified without consideration anything availability sufficient water
Furthermore justification proceed sequential way proceeding general principle empirical evidence justification prediction
Student S response highlight important point justifies separating scoring information scoring reasoning
A student compose justification using incorrect information
For instance student posed following justification reasoning would adequate even conclusion soil dry correct
The reasoning would rated higher student communicated Developing scoring rubric moderation requires highly informed teacher experienced process
Even teacher adequately prepared moderation process take time
The content standard call knowledge understanding
Considerable resource must therefore devoted preparing teacher others science education system design rate assessment require student display understanding described
The second assessment example focus inquiry
The content standard call understanding scientific inquiry developing ability inquire
As understanding natural world understanding inquiry contingent knowing concept principle law theory physical life earth science
Inquiry also requires reasoning capability skill manipulating laboratory field equipment
As understanding natural world inference student ability inquire understanding process based analysis performance science classroom work product
The example follows describes twelfth grade student participation extended inquiry
The exercise serf two purpose
It provides teacher information well student met inquiry standard
Equally important serf capstone experience school science program
The extended inquiry introduced early school year
It involves student working individual small group investigating question choice
Throughout school science program student encouraged identify question interest amenable investigation
These question recorded student research notebook
Early senior year high school student prepare draft statement question propose investigate discus question reasonable one
Those draft circulated member class
Students prepare written review classmate proposal commenting quality research question rationale investigating
Students revise research question based peer feedback
Finally student present defend revised question class
The teacher encourages require student work together research group two four student
After presenting research question class student form research group come agreement question investigate begin developing preliminary plan conducting investigation
Each individual group required keep extensive record group work especially documenting evolution final research question several question originally proposed
As plan investigation evolve research question sharpened modified meet practical constraint time resource available class
Each student maintains journal note process
When group satisfied plan progressed point work begin plan presented classmate
Written copy plan distributed written review followed class seminar discus research plan
On basis peer feedback group revise research plan recognizing plan implemented require still revision
Each student class responsible reviewing research plan every group including written critique recommendation modifying plan
During phase extended investigation student engage iterative process involving assembling testing apparatus designing testing form data collection developing testing data collection schedule collecting organizing interpreting data
Based note individual group prepares written report describing research
That report also includes data collected preliminary analysis
Based peer feedback group modify procedure continue data collection
When group convinced method working data reasonably consistent analyze data draw conclusion
After seminar research group present data analysis conclusion group prepares first draft research report
This draft circulated classmate preparation individual critique
This feedback used group prepare final report
While class engaged extended investigation teacher observes student performance student make presentation class interacts peer us computer laboratory apparatus
In addition teacher product individual student work well group work including draft research question critique student work individual student research notebook

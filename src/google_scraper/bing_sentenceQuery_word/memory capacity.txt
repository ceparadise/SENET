I curious know limit max RAM capacity OS reading microprocessor
I know limit OS OS Exabytes question get
I found calculation B MB GB
It different B EB
What I understand calculation bit turned byte reached result
The calculation byte since memory addressed unit byte
If machine word N bit addressed stored register whose size single machine word address different location byte principle could depend CPU I aware CPU address memory larger word
However complicated addressing mechanism used address memory
For example pointer could take machine word segment could applied successor
First computer architecture computing use processor datapath width integer size memory address width bit octet
Also CPU ALU architecture based register address bus data bus size due design decision may differ different
Secondly confusion created calculating maximum RAM capacity bit
The word usually considered containing single since memory calculation term byte result term byte
Hence unit written byteword address word So address mean address much byte word hence total capacity RAM OS similarily OS calculation address one byteword later written term byte
I hope make pretty clear
Thank input reply
The simple answer CPUs address byte CPUs address byte quite right one find exception refine explanation
CPUs MMUs manage separate virtual physical address space
They different size
The designation virtual space Applications pointer
The physical address space smaller larger virtual address space Q How determine maximum RAM capacity operating system
A Look OS documentation
I know limit OS GB OS Exabytes question get
Now speaking
many different address program distinguish
If program using bit bit pointer different address
Assuming position accommodate byte GB EB allocable capacity
This also answer last question What I understand calculation bit turned byte reached result
OP refers microprocessor first sentence
We need understand reference internal architecture
To illustrate important define topic discussion look While CPU address MiB RAM need two CPU cycle move word register RAM
So
Because CPU need address amount RAM
Having bit wide address bus CPU would allow B memory
OTOH bit wide address bus CPU feasible real demand HW available setup yet would increase complexity considerably
What come engineering business decision made given time

The first question How much RAM hardware support
For example n bit transferred CPU RAM every access CPU k address line CPU access bit byte
However CPU must address thing RAM example video memory IO ROM
So need add thing get maximum usable amount RAM
And depends CPU memory hardware much actually usable
For example address line enough hardware requires addressable space depending hardware RAM might usable likely
The next level much RAM firmware computer recognise
The computer know much RAM turned must recognise RAM
That usually done software firmly built computer
And software might able recognise say RAM
This often happens old computer memory chip available computer sold newer bigger memory chip recognised
So operating system come play
Usually OS limitation
Sure requires memory page table etc
RAM RAM available hold page table RAM
There case maker OS home version professional version OS home version OS may artifically restricted
Or OS may decided use quite arbitrarily small number bit index RAM page data structure example
If OS us bit store index RAM page RAM page OS handle GB RAM
Which quite possible OS written twenty year ago someone might thought nobody ever RAM
I remember computer could hold RAM RAM four time expensive rest computer

This taken OPERATING SYSTEMS INTERNALS AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES WILLIAM STALLINGS Consider microprocessor composed field first byte contains opcode remainder immediate operand operand address
What maximum directly addressable memory capacity
Now answer shud bit megabyte solution set say MBytes So I wrong solution set wrong
Start simpler example
Suppose address bit rather
With bit could address
In case could think memory divided chunk equal size one address per chunk For example content chunk would addressed three bit
Now much memory would total
It clearly time size chunk
Stalling using memory model chunk byte address would total memory byte one byte per address
A different computer though might built chunk byte
On machine address would byte memory byte per address
At rate address M possible address hence many possible chunk
If chunk byte would mean total addressable memory would byte
Similarly chunk byte long total addressable memory would chunk size number address B M MB
Most modern processor address memory granularity single bit limit size smallest chunk memory accessed byte
This called memory
With memory immediate could directly address MiB
Stallings assuming would directly addressable
In past processor used memory smallest chunk could accessed equal size register
By using larger smallest chunk size fewer bit needed address given size memory
word size immediate would able reference byte MiB
Using memory also simplified memory access
Outside DSPs embedded system processor memory popular today
As side note microcontrollers special mechanism atomic bit addressing region ARM section address space atomic set atomic clear bit instruction MIPS three bit instruction specify bit within byte
It might also noted ISAs shift immediate value access size accessing value would shift immediate one bit
This assumes base pointer address value properly aligned least bit zero value two least significant bit zero value etc
This allows smaller immediate provide larger access range accessing value larger byte

We worry running space lifetime
The human brain consists one billion neuron
Each neuron form connection neuron amounting trillion connection
If neuron could help store single memory running space would problem
You might gigabyte storage space similar space iPod USB flash drive

Many standard exist encoding like image encoding like video encoding like
By adding bit encoded unit redundancy allows computer detect error coded data correct based mathematical algorithm
Errors generally occur low probability due bit value flipping physical bit fatigue loss physical bit storage ability maintain distinguishable value due error inter communication

Generally lower storage hierarchy lesser greater access CPU
This traditional division storage primary secondary tertiary storage also guided cost per bit
In contemporary usage memory usually storage typically dynamic RAM form fast temporary storage
Storage consists storage device medium directly accessible typically drive device slower RAM retaining content powered
Historically called
Meanwhile storage device referred
also known often referred simply one directly accessible CPU
The CPU continuously read instruction stored executes required
Any data actively operated also stored uniform manner
Historically used rotating primary storage
By unreliable method mostly replaced
Core memory remained dominant advance technology allowed become economically competitive
This led modern RAM
It light quite expensive time
The particular type RAM used primary storage also
lose information powered
As shown diagram traditionally two primary storage besides main RAM Main memory directly indirectly connected central processing unit via
It actually two bus diagram
The CPU firstly sends number address bus number called indicates desired location data
Then read writes data using data bus
Additionally MMU small device CPU RAM recalculating actual memory address example provide abstraction task
As RAM type used primary storage volatile uninitialized start computer containing storage would source read instruction order start computer
Hence containing small startup program used computer read larger program storage RAM start execute
A technology used purpose called ROM terminology may somewhat confusing ROM type also capable
Many type ROM literally update possible however slow memory must erased large portion
Some run program directly ROM similar program rarely changed
Standard computer store program ROM rather use large capacity secondary storage well costly
Recently us refer historically called respectively
also known differs primary storage directly accessible CPU
The computer usually us channel access secondary storage transfer desired data using primary storage
Secondary storage lose data device powered
Per unit typically also two order magnitude le expensive primary storage
Modern computer system typically two order magnitude secondary storage primary storage data kept longer time
In modern computer usually used secondary storage
The time taken access given byte information stored hard disk typically thousandth second millisecond
By contrast time taken access given byte information stored memory measured billionth second nanosecond
This illustrates significant difference distinguishes memory rotating magnetic storage device hard disk typically million time slower memory
Rotating device drive even longer access time
With disk drive disk head reach proper placement data interest rotates subsequent data track fast access
To reduce seek time rotational latency data transferred disk large contiguous block
When data reside disk accessing large block hide latency offer opportunity design efficient
Sequential block access disk order magnitude faster random access many sophisticated paradigm developed design efficient algorithm based upon sequential block access
Another way reduce bottleneck use multiple disk parallel order increase bandwidth primary secondary memory

When computer finished reading information robotic arm return medium place library
Tertiary storage also known near online
The formal distinction online nearline offline storage For example spinning hard disk drive online storage spinning drive spin automatically massive array idle disk nearline storage
Removable medium tape cartridge automatically loaded nearline storage tape cartridge must manually loaded offline storage
computer data storage medium device control
The medium recorded usually secondary tertiary storage device physically removed disconnected
It must inserted connected human operator computer access
Unlike tertiary storage accessed without human interaction
storage used since detached medium easily physically transported
Additionally case disaster example fire destroys original data medium remote location probably unaffected enabling
storage increase general since physically inaccessible computer data confidentiality integrity affected attack technique
Also information stored archival purpose rarely accessed storage le expensive tertiary storage
In modern personal computer secondary tertiary storage medium also used storage

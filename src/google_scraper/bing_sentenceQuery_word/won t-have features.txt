The number college student pursuing computer science degree university rose first time six year according released study
Academia policymakers hailing news question facing CIOs others charge IT hiring How much Do company need employee deep technical skill developed computer science software engineering degree better business major
Not surprisingly computer science educator software company hardware manufacturer adamant need computer science major drive innovation tech company
The dearth computer science graduate forcing company look offshore qualified people argue
Not enough computer science major serious repercussion competitiveness say Professor Cary Laxer head computer science software engineering Institute Technology
There large number Chinese student Indian student interested work
We going lose competitive edge country turn software engineer
But CIOs IT staffing firm say need collaboration problem solving communication developed motivated college student
After today Millennials wireless social medium technology integrated lifestyle grasp exploit far better boss
Computer science degree mattered lot year ago IT cost center
But job IT The huge IT budget even CIOs line business say David Foote CEO Foote Partners conduct quarterly survey IT skill pay
This brought whole new group IT skill come mathematics economics business marketing
On March The Computing Research Association issued annual report number college student pursuing computer science bachelor degree university
The number shown sharp decline throughout decade
In fall around newly declared computer science major
That figure dropped half bust bottoming last two year
But increase

Having enough computer science software engineering major critical tech company say need hire undergraduate deep technical skill practical programming experience
For software engineering role tend look people strong computer science background experience programming say Yvonne Agyei director Talent Outreach Programs Google People Operations Department
We need core programming skill algorithm skill quantitative analysis
We looking people majored computer science engineering sometimes math physic
Agyei say hire computer savvy business major department software engineering
In addition software engineering role role within business within legal within finance facility technology passion technology important Agyei say
It help familiarity product
Having knowledge really important regardless aspect business go
Even year rise computer science major tech company say still enough computer scientist engineer fill open job
That tech company CIOs often hire instead
In responded drop computer science degree creating provides free software training tool college professor across discipline rather computer science department
IBM working college faculty worldwide around student
As company greater greater need computer communication software decline student going consequence supply demand balance say Kevin Faughnan director IBM Academic Initiative
IBM goal Academic Initiative encourage college student become familiar IT apply across industry
With initiative IBM focusing strengthening technical underpinning business major rather encouraging computer science major
The business student computer science skill intro data management Web part major Faughnan say
We try encourage faculty interdisciplinary
As part initiative IBM provided university simulation game teach business process modeling It incumbent business school integrate technology curriculum Faughnan say
I think technology much computer science major horizontal skill applied across discipline
For example ca marketing day without data mining
CIOs say hiring business major IT experience computer science major
Henry Eckstein senior vice president strategy technology York Insurance Services Group say member IT shop computer science software engineering degree
Most employee Russia
Eckstein say making hiring decision weighs experience first IT certification second college degree third
If I look candidate I see computer science major going influence decision I looking newer least I know good training discipline Eckstein say
But going someone computer science degree
Particularly I looking developer I looking skill set many year experience knowledge subject matter
When CIOs surveyed top skill looking employee cite technical skill
Instead top concern ethic critical thinking collaboration communication skill according CIO survey compiled
The technical skill demand programming database system analysis ranked lower CIOs priority list
You computer science degree get entry level job IT say Professor Jerry Luftman executive director School Technology Management Stevens Institute Technology
Luftman compiles SIM annual CIO survey
When CIOs asked skill looking people clear skill critical
Luftman say computer science major engineer make good IT professional critical thinking skill logical analysis
But say business information system major valuable employee balance technical skill business collaboration communication skill
During downturn IT asked work business partner identify opportunity leverage IT improve process improve productivity Luftman say
My advice Generation X Generation make sure good balance technical business skill
Stephen Pickett past president SIM auto industry CIO say lack computer science major problem CIOs
That SIM local chapter working business school improve technical offering computer science school improve business course
We necessarily need computer science graduate
A business graduate strong computer science curriculum work lot case Pickett say
In computer science school try add business curriculum get student coming
Pickett say MIS degree good match IT business skill
It enough add computer hobbyist
The thing need project management experience business process evaluation
You get knowing application desktop Pickett add
College grad look business process find improve people going popular
Striking right balance technical skill business knowledge critical given global economic meltdown Pickett say
In downturn even important get people solve business problem business problem much difficult solve Pickett say
You solve problem without significant business resource
You technical knowledge business knowledge lot imagination
Foote say counsel high school student think carefully business like work
The question Do want techie guy work bowel organization work infrastructure job want front working application
Foote say
If want front might want work HR finance whatever area business interest
You also want look industry casino insurance whatever figure product service interested
Foote recommends student majoring math business pursue minor computer science
That give much view IT give option say
Computer science educator claim image old fashioned way viewing program
There perception propagated medium computer science major mean work bowel organization coding front terminal eating potato chip drinking Mountain Dew say Professor Lenny Pitt Director Undergraduate Programs Department Computer Science University Illinois
This far truth
Our graduate working bridge management technical people
They technical writing software testing usability
In light declining enrollment decade top computer science school like University Illinois retooled curriculum embrace soft skill collaboration communication
These department focused graduating student explain complex technical issue layman term
The decline enrollment last six year forced professor think teaching computer science student make sure giving skill need successful like collaborative learning working part team say Peter Harsha director government affair CRA
Carnegie Mellon University emphasizes teamwork collaboration computer science program requires technical communication course
Students also required take course humanity pursue minor field foreign language
Twenty year ago kid would get program would nerdy added requirement program force broader say Professor Peter Lee head Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University
Today opposite problem people tendency dabbler
We want deep broad
Carnegie Mellon strategy seems working
Last year Carnegie Mellon computer science graduate went work industry including IT vendor Microsoft Google IT user Bloomberg Goldman Sachs
The went graduate school
Where see demand high salary people deep technical software skill Lee say
These student computer savvy able manage IT operation
They actually understand software issue engineer software
Those people recruiter want
Lee predicts computer science major remain demand industry becoming dependent computing data mining

The new OS place strict limitation user
For example run program called apps come Windows Store
And default web browser always Edge successor Microsoft Internet Explorer
What change
First Windows S universal replacement Windows
Microsoft intends Windows S specific audience namely people want curated hypothetically secure experience computer
One company school
By limiting program run device Microsoft decrease chance encounter malware security risk
It also help prevent people trying install program machine capable running well
But default web browser many outlet talking including
According Microsoft user able download web browser available Windows Store able switch default new browser
Click file Edge pop automatically
You also wo able change default search engine Bing anything else want Google something navigate first
This reminds dark time Microsoft past went
The accusation Microsoft tied browser Internet Explorer tightly Windows operating system disadvantaged competing browser like Netscape
Back Windows PCs made overwhelming majority computer market
Microsoft forced change practice finally expired
When decree ended Microsoft published statement included sentence Our experience changed u shaped view responsibility industry
Whether feature Windows S product violate spirit message may matter perspective
It different world today competition computer market space
The Windows S operating system new standard
And although wo many option Windows S machine always choose buy different type PC instead
So comparison interesting see Microsoft launch product explicitly follows strategy similar one could led government breaking Microsoft smaller company

If heard book probably wo much interest find
If part book unclear even wrong please post comment discussion page simply fix
In particular please say book assumes knowledge skill Computer Science student
Accepted language Projects written language
You meet several coloured box meaning Questions test click check right There lot concept need familiar definition highlighted like meaning This exam worth AS grade
It examined June
Understand relationship hardware software able define
Understand need function system software Describe different type application software criterion selecting appropriate software particular purpose
Describe language assembly language
Awareness development programming language limitation programming Define type language translator describe situation would appropriate
Physical component make computer system Computer program related data provide instruction telling computer hardware Hardware Software relationship mean without software hardware limited without hardware software would able run
They need fulfill potential
Define Hardware Physical component make computer system
Define Software Computer program related data provide instruction telling computer hardware
Give name numbered hardware component Give example software If mentioned brand name get mark exam want software type meaning written
After previous question probably answer
You probably used lot software year going study different classification type software
The two main classification software program fit Without software hardware would sit nothing perform specific task
To make hardware run need use software task select correct type software job
software designed operate computer hardware provide platform running application software Modern computer complex machine involving many different part
To keep running well need system software
System software handle smooth running component computer
It also provide general functionality program use
These include program may tool speed computer tool develop new software program keep safe attack
There several different type system software look detail shortly software designed help user perform specific task Application software designed people like perform task consider useful
This might ability scientist work statistical information using set result someone want play latest computer game
There several category Application software look shortly Place following software correct category What two main category software
Why software important computer system
Without software task hardware perform often fixed limited For two main classification software give three sub category Place software product correct category application system Fill missing software category We know system software software help computer run
We look different type system software needed An OS set program manage computer hardware resource provide common service application software
The operating system important type system software computer system
Without operating system user run application program computer unless application program self booting
operating system schedule task efficient use system may also include accounting cost allocation processor time mass storage printing resource
For hardware function main memory management operating system act middleman application program computer hardware although application code usually executed directly hardware frequently call OS interrupted
Operating system found almost device contains computer mobile phone video game console supercomputer web server
Examples popular modern operating system include Android iOS Linux Mac OS X Microsoft Windows use name exam
You might hear word Open Source read operating system
well known Open Source OS well known Closed Source OS
So mean
Open Source program program see code source edit copy use wish within confines
You even sell person would welcome acquire code free wanted
As result Linux developed one person one company us code developed thousand people working different organisation world
And result many different version known Linux including Ubuntu Slackware Fedora
Android built using Linux code
Closed Source software allow people look code adapt
Companies normally sell closed source product pay copy Windows
Currently desktop run Windows OS
type system software specific task perform related working computer example anti virus software disk defragment etc
Utility software confused application software allows user thing like creating text document playing game listening music surfing web
Rather providing kind functionality utility software usually focus computer infrastructure including computer hardware operating system application software data storage operates
Due focus utility often rather technical targeted people advanced level computer knowledge
Examples utility software include collection compiled routine shared multiple program printing function
Library program contain code data provide service program interface look feel printing network code even graphic engine computer game
If ever wondered Microsoft Office program look feel using graphical user interface library
For computer game developer might time budget write new graphic engine often buy graphical library speed development allow quickly develop good looking game run desired hardware
For example Battlefield Need Speed use engine
Most programming language standard set library used offering code handle graphic specialist math function
You also create custom library start write lot program similar functionality find useful
Below example might import library The final type system software need know translator software
This software allows new program written run computer converting source code machine code
There three type cover lot detail shortly Give system software type Explain two function operating system Give benefit using library program Give two example utility program What system software
System software performs task analyse help smooth running computer system What utility software
Utility software kind system software designed help analyze configure optimize maintain computer What purpose translator software give two example convert program source code machine code executed processor General purpose application software type application used variety task
It limited one particular function
For example word processor could classed general purpose software would allow user write novel create restaurant menu even make poster
Examples General purpose application software include Word processor Spreadsheet Presentation software
Whatever use brand name
Special purpose application software type software created execute one specific task
For example camera application phone allow take share picture
Another example would chess game would allow play chess
Other example special purpose application software web browser calculator medium player calendar program etc
Again make sure use brand name
Bespoke application software tailor made specific user purpose
For example factory may require software run robot make car however factory making car world software required would specially built task
Other example might include software military operation software hospital medical equipment software written inside bank financial institution
There several thing consider purchasing bespoke software plus side However must also consider List describe three type application software Give example Do let examiner catch using product name
Why might choose use general purpose software instead bespoke software might suitable
general purpose software However There many type programming language might already heard example Java Python Assembly
We look history language came still useful
In case keep mind thing computer execute machine code converted language run processor
The program language pure machine code one zero

Programmers design code hand transfer computer using punch card punch tape flicking switch
There need translate code run straight away
This may sound rather archaic benefit And course drawback programming language way describing Assembly code may already met
By using code resembling English programming becomes much easier
The usage code load store mean code easier read write
To convert assembly code program object code run computer requires line assembly replaced equivalent one line object machine code Assembler Assembly code similar benefit writing machine code one one relationship
This mean assembly code often used writing low level fast code specific hardware
Until recently machine code used program thing mobile phone speed performance language close Assembly C ability talk processor register Assembly use declining
As hopefully see benefit using Languages plus thing make Assembly great And course drawback Even though Assembly code easier read machine code still straight forward perform loop conditionals writing large program slow process creating statement jump
programming language brought many feature code loop conditionals class etc
This mean one line third generation code produce many line object machine code saving lot time writing program
code executed line line programmer defined sequence Third generation High Level Languages code imperative
Imperative mean code executed line line sequence
For example Would output Third generation language platform independent meaning code written one system work another
To convert generation program object code requires
To summarise However There several type language cover detail
They include language designed reduce programming effort time take develop software resulting reduction cost software development
They always successful task sometimes resulting inelegant hard maintain code
Languages designed specific purpose mind might include language query database language make report language construct user interface
An example generation programming type declarative language
describe computation performed perform
Not imperative
An example declarative language might learn completing web design unit Describe meant imperative language code executed line line sequence What relationship line object code line generation language code one line generation one line object code What relationship line object code line generation language code one line generation many line object code Give two benefit using generation using assembly
Give one drawback Give definition declarative language describes computation performed perform
Not imperative
For generation language give program translator required convert language generation object code Logic Gate Boolean Algebra In British mathematician developed Boolean Algebra
Instead algebra us number boolean algebra us truth value
By defining sentence using truth value performing operation truth value work overall conclusion complex statement
Boolean Algebra massive impact Computer Science language computer understand language boolean
Logic gate piece hardware perform operation boolean input allowing u create complex device abstract boolean algebra
Logic gate fundamental building block hardware processor made billion
A logic gate typically one two input example defined A B There six type gate need know NOT AND OR XOR NAND NOR A gate always give output input
gate
A NOT gate take one boolean input flip
It possible double NOT
This reverse original NOT
The symbol would extra bar
In Boolean Algebra write symbol placing bar top letter letter
To summarise truth table showing relationship A An gate combine boolean value two input get two input need know type gate
If output true
If input false put false
In Boolean Algebra write symbol placing bullet point two value
An easy way remember AND gate work thinking circuit turn light bulb
If switch bulb light switch bulb wo light
To summarise truth table showing different value two input A B result ANDing value together An gate combine boolean value two input
If input true output true
If input false output false
In Boolean Algebra write symbol placing plus symbol two value
An easy way remember OR gate work thinking circuit turn light bulb
If one switch bulb light switch bulb wo light
To summarise truth table showing different value two input A B result ORing value together An OR gate combine boolean value two input
If input true output true
If input false input true output false
In Boolean Algebra write symbol placing plus symbol surrounded circle two value
To summarise truth table showing different value two input A B result XORing value together A gate combine boolean value two input AND together NOT result
If input true output true
If input true output false
To draw NAND gate draw AND gate add circle front see
In Boolean Algebra write symbol taking AND equation NOTing result
To summarise truth table showing different value two input A B result NANDing value together A gate combine boolean value two input OR together NOT result
If input true output true
If either input true result false
To draw NOR gate draw OR gate add circle front see
In Boolean Algebra write symbol taking OR equation NOTing result
Give symbol gate diagram OR statement Give symbol gate diagram AND statement
Give symbol gate diagram XOR statement Give answer following equation TRUE AND TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE NOT TRUE
TRUE FALSE TRUE Draw NAND gate truth table Complete following table Now learnt logic gate take look combined inside hardware
You may well asked exam draw logic gate work combination logic gate output
In section look best way describe set logic gate boolean algebra
Let take look quick example For following logic gate combination work output Q This equation simplified equal find case section coming This equation simplified equal always false find case section coming A common question exam given boolean algebra asked express logic gate
Let take look addition subtraction example familiar First going deal bracket Finally combine answer It work exactly way boolean algebra instead using number store result use logic gate As equation going deal bracket first combine answer Draw circuit diagram following
Remember deal AND OR first
A common question exam give description system
You asked create boolean statement description finally build logic gate circuit show system Using boolean algebra describe following scenario Where Before rush answering question like let try break component
The questioner often trying trick
The two occasion alarm sound caveat alarm sound either true two thing also true namely engine car towed Combining get remember bracket
The next step create diagram A security system allows people two different clearance level access building
Either low privilege card carrying mobile
Alternatively key allowed carry mobile
The input available Write boolean equation express If wrote You wrong
The reason text say This mean mean carry mobile choose simplifies
Draw logic gate diagram solve Sometimes cheaper create circuit using one sort gate might asked exam
These gate tend NAND NOR gate
But create complex circuit using one type gate
may well ask
We cover gate made NAND NOR gate Because Because Render following boolean equation using NAND gate Now try similar question using NOR gate might need De Morgan Law help use truth table simplify thing Why might want use one sort gate create circuit
It might cheaper make circuit one sort gate might make simpler circuit We met gate logic combination gate
Another way representing gate logic boolean algebra way algebraically representing logic gate
You already covered symbol quick reminder For exam might A common question give complex boolean equation work simpler exact equivalent
This useful designing circuit want minimise number gate using make circuit use particular type gate
To simplify boolean equation must familiar two method
You normally use either try master Draw truth table following We going solve using truth table need break problem component part As equation us A B list different value take total Next going work bracket first add truth table Finally OR result A find final column truth table Now truth table complete look final column simpler way writing
Why aye
The final column true A true require B input
So simplify telling u Let look another example We first need break equation component part
Starting A B work finally
This simplified telling u
How jump conclusion
Let take look place result true We need get combination A B give result shown
We see whenever A false answer true We also see whenever B value true answer also true So know need combine get equation solving case
If AND give u one scenario answer
If OR give u three answer matching response
This solution
Give simplified boolean description following truth table Simplify following boolean equation using truth table This simplified The answer case plain This simplified OR De Morgan Laws Remember deal AND OR meaning read equation This simplified This simplified Sometimes complex set gate simplified save cost make faster circuit
A quick way boolean identity
Boolean identity quick rule allow simplify boolean expression
For situation described Using identity rule Take A common side equation Using identity rule Using identity rule Using identity rule Take A common side equation Using identity rule Using identity rule Examples manipulating simplifying simple Boolean expression
Let try simplify following Using rule Trying slightly complicated example dealing bracket first Sometimes use combination boolean identity equation
This always simple prepared write truth table check answer Where go let take look identity Now something requires This take This take This take This take Take common factor side De Morgan law used simplify Boolean equation build equation involving one sort gate generally using NAND NOR gate
This lead cheaper hardware
There two law need remember An easy way remember De Morgan Laws rhyme
Let prove I lying creating truth table prove Since value last column row cover possible truth value assignment variable conclude two expression logically equivalent
Now prove method There rather nice concrete way thinking gate padlocked two padlock padlock padlock
We use stand padlock open stand padlock open
You go gate padlock open AND padlock open You go gate padlock locked OR padlock locked Since go gate opposite negation go gate remembering gate open gate closed able see NOT gate open Simplify following From looking truth table see equates
But also know get result using boolean identity
Let give go Let try another If catching notice equivalent
But better check boolean algebra identity De Morgans Law confirm correct answer
If catching notice equivalent
But better check boolean algebra identity De Morgans Law confirm correct answer
Physical component make computer system Computer program related data provide instruction telling computer hardware Hardware Software relationship mean without software hardware limited without hardware software would able run
They need fulfill potential
Define Hardware Physical component make computer system
Define Software Computer program related data provide instruction telling computer hardware
Give name numbered hardware component Give example software If mentioned brand name get mark exam want software type meaning written
After previous question probably answer
Modern computing arguably started British Mathematician proposed difference engine
This mechanical machine could calculate number given input
Unfortunately Babbage never got enough funding realise plan Victorian Computing Revolution however see completed modern version Science Museum London along half Babbage brain
Since Babbage several different design computer one going focus called Model Von Neumann machine
In machine Consider program stored DVD get machine run input data DVD memory using system bus
Once program loaded memory instruction sent CPU line line using system bus executed
Any thing printed shown screen sent Output box
We look detail component The processor Central Processor Unit CPU one complex part computer system
The processor executes program supervises operation rest system
Single chip processor otherwise known microprocessor
theorized number transistor could integrated onto chip would double every month modern processor contain billion transistor
Multicore microprocessor popular processor several core allowing multiple program thread run
data store directly addressed CPU Main memory used store program instruction data using System Bus communicate CPU
Main memory often created using Random Access Memory RAM Read Only Memory ROM
Modern computer gigabyte RAM meaning large program run multiple program run
The main memory larger number program run
Main memory consists data stored address general main memory address vice versa
In example perform following assembly code instruction This would return word Courgette If perform following assembly code instruction This would change value stored memory location Celery Beetroot Random Access Memory read written
Data cleared power Read Only Memory read data maintained power The two main type main memory ROM RAM
Whilst RAM might several gigabyte size ROM often kilobyte
As ROM read memory tends store core software instruction code needed load Operating System RAM known change bios
RAM much much larger store code run operating system program run computer
When load disc game console code wo anything loaded disc system RAM see loading screen
Give definition main memory Main memory data store directly addressed CPU What difference ROM RAM
ROM Read Only Memory RAM random access memory
This mean ROM written read
RAM read written
Name four component Von Neumann Architecture A Bus connection different device
This connection normally consist multiple wire along signal instruction data carried
In Von Neumann Architecture single bus manage connection three main component
The System Bus consists separate bus specific task need know
This three bus model expansion Von Neumann architecture showing greater detail
A bus carry address signal CPU Main Memory device
This might involve CPU requesting data Main Memory sending address data Main Memory Main Memory returning data along data bus
Let take look code This code asking load data memory address CPU address bus send address processor sends processor
To CPU would send along Address Bus value memory location would sent along Data Bus back CPU
The size Address Bus dictate much Main Memory system
For example Address Bus bit This would mean Main Memory could different addressable block A bus typically consisting wire used transport data instruction three component model
The larger Data Bus data transported one time
For example bit Data Bus maximum value could send along Bus would The larger Data Bus data send complex instruction use
A typically consisting wire used transport control signal three component model
The control bus used carry important information message say device finished job device plugged
A simple example would plug USB key moment screen pop asking want
The control bus also contains interrupt signal allow device printer keyboard disk etc
signal finished request
The CPU temporarily suspends current program service device resume previous program
The information serve well exam however way many modern processor work may break definition learnt Complete following table What largest number following width data bus carry one time width wire width wire width wire How many address following width address bus address width wire width wire width wire An address bus address maximum memory wire width
How many wire would need address maximum memory
byte memory But really good math answer
twice know half size
device used system get information internal connected CPU refer hand peripheral torso
We cover specific one need learn little later moment need know fundamental difference If look Von Neumann Architecture notice mention Keyboard display smart move want force every computer keyboard think game console keyboard VDU computer player screen
However computer architecture include specific controller An controller electronic circuit connects system bus device provides correct voltage current system bus device
Examples would include port complementary method performing CPU peripheral device computer
This allows device connected CPU without specialist hardware one
Think USB port computer connect Keyboards Mice Game pad Cameras Phones etc
connect using port
Main memory expensive often require storing data wo use constantly
Think computer game played couple month
The last thing want store code main memory taking precious expensive space
To get past issue use secondary storage
This normally inexpensive data storage sitting external CPU connected controller use need
Secondary Storage store data permanently without need electricity remain always Think USB key need plugged keep data
So taking game example load game main memory maybe DVD hard disk need
Examples secondary storage include Name input peripheral Name output peripheral Name two way connect peripheral CPU Name secondary storage device Name controller A computer must able access main memory reading writing using addressable memory
Main memory little like set school locker different number
Each locker contains block data fill one locker use next locker expand
Looking example see locker contains whilst locker contain sentence The Cat sat dog
Locker empty locker contains boolean value locker contains number
As see used one character locker number could ever locker
If limit number address use limit amount memory talk
If small address bus wo able much main memory
The way data stored computer similar program must main memory order executed
The instruction fetched decoded executed one time Building Von Neumann architecture get idea stored program concept work
If ever loaded game console might notice This stored program concept motion
Let take apart happening How many different address line address bus address
How address bus affect main memory
If small address bus limited number address talk therefore much main memory directly address
How wide would address bus talk address
line wide since What wrong using bit address bus memory location main memory
We address different location
It would able talk address location
Define stored program concept A program must resident main memory order executed
The instruction main memory CPU
A processor CPU several core component work together perform calculation
You need know interact The Arithmetic Logic Unit ALU digital circuit performs arithmetic logical operation
Where arithmetic operation include thing ADD SUBTRACT logical operation include thing AND OR NOT
The ALU fundamental building block central processing unit CPU computer without computer would able calculate anything
Some example assembly code instruction would use ALU follows processor instruction The control unit sits inside CPU coordinate input output device computer system
It coordinate fetching program code main memory CPU directs operation processor component providing timing control signal
A timing device connected processor synchronises fetch decode execute cycle run Your computer might contain several clock regulate different thing
The clock going look keep processor line
It send processor signal regular time telling start fetch decode execute routine
The number cycle performed CPU per second Clock speed measured Hertz mean second
You probably heard clock speed MHz mean cycle per second potentially million calculation
A computer speed GHz mean might capable processing instruction per second
However simple processor perform one calculation clock cycle processor different manufacturer using different architecture often difficult compare
See
Also increase processor core Xbox core might time clock might ticking nothing processor calculate processor sit idle
small amount fast storage part processor For immediate calculation using main memory slow
Imagine send signal along address bus data along data bus want store result adding two number together
The distance processor main memory even though might centimetre far enough signal take significant time get
To get past issue small amount memory stored inside processor called
Registers incredibly fast piece memory used store result arithmetic logic calculation
Different processor different set register
A common register acc data register user able directly address talk use store result wish
Processors may also register particular purpose There also register particular need know meet detail next chapter Give description Arithemtic Logic Unit The Arithmetic Logic Unit ALU digital circuit performs arithmetic logical operation
What mean clock cycle per second What processor clock Synchronises operation processor What register small amount fast storage part processor Name register used processor explain If want increase performance computer try several thing For different method going look old game console see performance increase achieved The number cycle performed CPU per second The obvious way increase speed computer would increase speed computer clock
With faster clock speed processor would forced perform instruction per second
As see console table successive console showed increase clock speed
A clock speed MHz twice fast clock speed MHz meaning able calculate twice many calculation given time
But stop u increasing clock speed much want
If study Physics might already know problem increased clock speed increased current flow circuit
The current flow hotter thing get
You might notice laptop get hot even mobile phone something processor intensive like playing game
The faster clock speed hotter processor run
To counter computer scientist come smarter chip design introduced heat sink fan even liquid cooling computer
If processor run hot burn
The number bit information processor process one time Another way increase performance computer increase word size
This mean increasing number bit computer process one time
As see console table increasing word size big part creating faster console even named console boast word size
With larger word computer handle larger precise calculation complicated thing
Modern computer mostly bit word size specialist hardware game console able handle bit word
Imagine able use word length letter le wanted describe dinosaur someone
We might try following If able use letter per word larger word size could achieve fewer word
However understand longer word would know dinosaur million meant maybe stopping brief moment remember
In computing terminology would complicated hardware using lot little word could faster processing larger one
The number bit information bus carry one time number wire making bus Now understand word size
Imagine processor able understand bit word single time
This pretty standard
But happens bus sending word memory processor bit wide
We get bottle neck
It would involve four chunk data sent along Data Bus word processor execute
In word increase performance must also increase bus size avoid bottle neck Imagine friend understand word bit length sending word
If link u bus say chat window website allowed letter time bus width
We send following Requiring seven data sends friend ready process word sent
If able send letter larger bus width friend would wait around receive data
Name three way increase Processor performance What draw back might increasing clock speed bring
Processor might need extra cooling hardware stop heating What benefit increasing word length
Computers perform complex instruction one go dealing larger number greater number accuracy How might bus width impact speed computer
If bus width smaller word size CPU wait around whilst bus delivers data instruction
A common exam question name component computer architecture diagram
Now met processor bus various computer component start answer question like following Match following component number diagram Processor Data bus Control Bus Main memory Keyboard Secondary storage Address bus Clock Monitor VDU controller disk controller keyboard controller Do worry size problem going tackle bit bit
first step remember difference component Now remembered device label
For following diagram applicable add single multi directional connection device bus simple instruction executed directly CPU As hopefully already know computer understand binary
We going look simplest instruction give computer
This called machine code
Machine code allows computer perform basic essential task
For section going use Accumulator met register earlier store intermediate result calculation
Amongst others following instruction important processor Assembly code easy read interpretation machine code one one matching one line assembly equal one line machine code Let take look quick coding example using assembly code
The code equivalent saying
range instruction CPU execute There many different instruction use machine code already met three LDA ADD STO processor capable understanding many
The selection instruction machine understand called instruction set
Below list instruction might used Let u look complex example assembly code instruction You notice general instruction two main part Depending word size different number bit available opcode operand
There two different philosophy play processor choosing lot different instruction smaller operand Intel AMD others choosing le instruction space operand ARM
What instruction set range instruction CPU execute Name explain two part make machine code instruction For word bit opcode bit operand For bit word bit opcode Why might manufacturer choose increase instruction set size
increase number discrete instruction executed What might problem increasing space taken opcode
le space operand meaning reduced range precision data processed single instruction Give two benefit increasing word size processor
You might notice instruction use others might even inkling difference
Well truth Let take look quick example Let take look without hash There many type addressing mode

Understand structure Internet role packet switching Understand difference Internet Web intranet
Uniform Resource Locator URL Uniform Resource Identifier URI Domain Names IP Addresses Internet registry Internet registrar Internet Service Providers ISP Domain Name Server DNS The Model Common Standard Protocols Understand role web browser retrieving web page web page resource rendering accordingly
global system interconnected computer network use standard Internet Protocol suite The internet impact heavily upon way live study work
But always way
In ARPA part American Department Defence funded several large computing project
These project expensive situated different part USA
It unreasonable expect research group travel site far expensive build needed method link together information could easily exchanged
created basing communication
This system communication broke message chunk passed site using network interlinked computer
Due unreliable nature connection link network broke packet could around problem reach destination
The concept similar driver take different route meet blocked road
A popular myth internet started American Department Defense looking could maintain control military installation event receiving end Soviet Nuclear strike
This would mean communication site would maintained even one site connecting installation knocked
A sound idea reason starting ARPANET
The network never carried classified material predominantly used research purpose connecting research institution including Universities UK
In ARPA funded experimental network made effort unite
At time limit initial network node host reached protocol created
This protocol set rule allowed different network talk
This protocol still form main link network internet day
As internet consists many different network interlinking internet central structure governing body
This make robust meaning one connection two host lost probably find another route send information
It also pose threat government struggle restrict information available citizen
Countries North Korea China filter internet link connection outside world mean government control come country giving ability filter website available allow switch time crisis cutting connection
This happened Tunisia Egypt Libya tried stop citizen getting information outside world
system interlinked hypertext document accessed via Internet The first thing notice World Wide Web internet subset internet offer
The internet host form data including game video telecommunication etc
WWW transmits hypertext document
The WWW accessed web browser linking file together using invented British computer scientist Sir
private network within organisation may offer printer sharing file sharing communication private website etc us internet technology web browser device interconnects two computer network interchange packet To link multiple computer together need use device called router switch
These device sending message one system another making sure packet get destination Packet switching method internet work feature delivery packet data device shared network
For example school web server sending webpage internet sending email friend
To get one device another data packet travel network adapter network node
The route taken packet might vary time might lot data travelling node meaning packet queued
This result varying time take send data one device another depending traffic load network
If play computer game online might heard term latency lag time taken send data one device another
The higher latency time taken send data le responsive game
People low latency tend better game machine responsive
To see time take send message using packet switching use command time long take send data another device case used ping server As see data sent location attempt second attempt met traffic way took much longer
However millisecond probably would notice
As packet switching define set route data sent disruption network circumnavigated The command used map route one machine another internet showing intermediate node case message took ten step get
The code show trace home network website
You see hop got lost data
If want try home different command used different operating system For following packet Green Blue Red assuming step router router take equal time
What order packet arrive destination
How make sure packet read correct order
Each packet sequence number attached ordered reach destination
What happens packet get permanently lost way host
The packet resent confirmation message returned recipient What happens router network fails
How packet get destination
The packet around failed node numerical label assigned device computer printer participating computer network us Internet Protocol Every device attached network number assigned
This unique number called IP Address might familiar format Currently common form IP Address us bit store address
This mean theoretically different IP Addresses exist
However due allocation IP range different organisation task number lower
An address typically shown split chunk shown
Different range IP address categorised differently first part IP specifying IP address second part defining
Different set IP range allocated particular network geographic area company etc
The table show several example IP range us put As saw packet switching every request get sent internet sent sender IP address attached
This useful many different reason
Firstly send confirmation message sender confirm received data
Secondly website keep track user come
Thirdly website block request certain IP address range
For example running national television service BBC programming paid fellow countryman would want people country watching programme paid
If try access BBC iPlayer USA say Not available area
This American IP would banned IP range
IP banning also used government bar population accessing website certain IP address
The diagram show two intranet connect across internet
If computer Intranet A IP address want send message computer Intranet B send message Router connected Intranet A
This router route message onto internet going router router reach router attached Intranet B
This router pas message correct machine Intranet B
Notice intranet connected internet router computer intranet appear IP router connected internet
If share house someone commits crime online finger might pointed whole household
Using IP address way never intention designer would much prefer machine distinct IP address however shortage IP address possible
What needed system address available
As might noticed limit number address limit well current population world
If future every inhabitant planet connected internet would enough IP Addresses use
This problem current introduced try resolve
us bit address meaning theoretically address available different possible address
The address bit split Why would ever need many may ask
With many address allow person multiple device connected internet currently driven demand internet mobile phone
We also looking connecting lot device internet might currently connected
For example could fridge telling u low milk oven telling u need cleaning bike telling u need service
The future coming watch space
What IP address give example
Numerical label assigned device computer printer participating computer network us Internet Protocol What IP address range internal network
OR What IP address would internal network machine appear connecting internet
The address router Convert following IP address binary Convert following IP address decimal Why introduced
bit mean machine connect internet eventually run IP Addresses
allows address used
For following IP address split two part label name Internet participant computer network service
One domain name connected multiple IP address Trying remember IP address difficult trying remember people phone number
Not many people well far likely using domain name access website
A domain name allows u link server computer using easily remembered name
The domain name also tell u bit location visiting use
Sometimes top level domain name might joined second level domain chained together tell detailed information Second level domain name typically tell owns address
Finally host service name connecting
For example In example client sends request Domain Name Server domain name lookup hierarchical Results remembered period time reduce work load
translates domain name IP address If modern mobile phone unlikely type number friend time want call text
You far likely use address book typing name letting phone find number
This exactly principle behind Domain Name System
A DNS server translates domain name meaningful human IP Addresses purpose locating addressing device worldwide
Domain name far easier human remember IP address
To see domain name action use command pinging google us DNS server find IP address want send ping packet Or Linux try allow organisation individual buy domain name Internet registrar responsible allocating internet domain anyone want one
If someone wanted website domain name would go internet registrar order buy website name
These service typically require payment order maintain control name website
If renew website internet registrar may sell buyer
In early day World Wide Web many instance company paying lot money buy web domain private individual
Other organisation shared address many legal fight much cash exchanged gain control domain name
If want take look website past take look look following website mid hold domain name registered
They allow owner link domain name IP address
Well known domain usually registry You may ask company would want domain link multiple IP address
If think multinational company website someone try load homepage necessarily want load webpage server IP address side world
So depending region would point IP address close current location
Typing Europe Asia send different IP address even though used domain name
Sometimes content server wo depending region
Also big site geographic IP splitting well
This domain name undergoing heavy usage one particular IP address might busy domain name pointed server sitting different IP address balancing user accessing site
company offer customer access internet Getting direct connection internet quite costly involving specialist hardware
Most people organisation pay ISPs link internet
Examples Internet Service Providers AOL BT Sky TalkTalk Virgin Media
Describe Domain Name Server Domain Name Servers translate domain name IP address Describe ISP stand ISP Internet Service Provider company offer customer access internet What difference Internet Registrar Internet Registry Internet Registrars allow people company buy domain name
Internet Registries keep track owns domain name IP address domain name link List top level domain name Describe following domain name mean List three part make domain name Give two reason company might want use domain name instead IP Address website
A character string identifying resource internet Resources document file folder sitting internet need method identify access
URIs provide way linking resource
There two type URI need know URL exam
The URN play identified book number

The project gutenberg page
book A character string referring location internet resource A URL URI addition identifying resource provides mean locating resource describing primary access mechanism network location
URLs allow u specify domain name exact location resource internet
For example following link picture wikicommons We break constituent part We therefore summarise URL follows Describe difference URN URL Give part make URL For following address describe part The history computing started centralised computer many case mainframe server performing calculation
Client computer attached centralised computer server wanted calculate something would wait central computer respond
As computing power got cheaper client node became powerful central computer le important
However growth internet shift back client server model
Powerful central computer store information email document music video offer service file hosting printing game hosting internet access client computer fetch information use service central server
In next year likely see software moving away running desktop running remote server accessing client called
As example modern client server model consider video sharing website
The website let call server store video uploaded site
The website used million client day connects server watch video
When client connects server asks particular video server load video RAM large array hard disk sends video client
The client receiving video press play watch video
Other example server might shared printing service college
The print server hosted single computer anyone college want print request sent server
In case server keep track much printing credit user make sure print queue dealt properly
The current model starting change company le likely offer service centralised server
Increasingly internet firm reaching global clientèle make little sense server server based one location server America user Armenia user experience slow access service
Another problem power cut affect server connection one server set server go service offering internet also stop
With service may distributed globe meaning wherever server reasonably close offering access data service need
It also mean one server go server different location keep service running
Keeping database synchronised across globe mail client mail Switzerland Swaziland complex task firm amazon rackspace offer service help handle
One downside cloud computing never quite sure data careful might find data stored country le stringent data protection law
computer program running serve request program client Servers software program case run normal computing hardware
Server software includes application system access service made available server Clients software program process connect server sending request receiving response
Client example include Give example server might used Serving website hosting game file sharing printer sharing What server client
Describe process involved web server delivering web page client Describe situation single server many client model might work well set rule governing way device communicate With network internet need allow computer talk
To make sure computer talk another way understands set rule governing mode communication
These rule called
There many different protocol defining rule specific communication type
application process specific communication endpoint attached IP address When send receive data client server sending lot different type data
To make sure data dealt correct program example website request dealt web server need add port number
Each application port number associated
For example web server port game doom port
Combining IP address port give u socket
This direct connection process application machine
The following example connecting webserver
There many one might need know What port number
A port number application process specific communication endpoint attached IP address What port number web server would use
Combined IP port number called
Socket What sort server following referencing Several protocol used transmit data across network including internet secure
This mean one router used get data one host another read data sent technique called
Normally problem data transmitted secret reading people packet without permission crime UK
File Transfer Protocol FTP standard network protocol used copy file one host another network Internet
FTP built architecture
FTP user may authenticate using unencrypted protocol connect anonymously server configured allow
FTP work port
The first FTP client application interactive tool implementing standard command syntax
Graphical user interface client since developed many popular desktop operating system use today
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP networking protocol behind World Wide Web
HTTP allows transmission Hypertext document webpage
HTTP work port
Telnet network protocol used Internet local area network provide communication server remote client
A client connect server using terminal black white command line console deliver command server perform thing like remote software installation system update
Telnet work several different port
Pros Cons Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP Internet standard sending electronic mail across Internet Protocol IP network
SMTP specified outgoing mail transport us TCP port
The protocol receiving mail called Post Office Protocol us port
Sometimes need send data securely network
There several protocol allow
You normally tell protocol secure letter name
Examples include SSH SFTP HTTPS SMTP NOT secure
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS combination Hypertext Transfer Protocol protocol provide encrypted communication secure identification network web server
HTTPS often used sensitive information sent internet example internet banking webpage
What protocol
set rule computer use allow communicate Name protocol used following What Telnet might unsuitable
Telnet allows remotely control machine command line
It insecure meaning use confidential data someone might packet sniff activity read information
unique identifier assigned network connection embedded every Network Interface Card production IP address change example connect laptop internet home get one IP address
If take around friend connect would given another IP address
unique device given every network interface MAC address including mobile phone game console wireless card
This important consider computer one network interface
For example laptop might network card wireless card one handling BitTorrent web browsing
When receive message network interface sent
The MAC address would mean message directed particular network interface namely wireless card card
In moment see use MAC address stack
The common protocol internet Transmission Control Protocol
To send data network requires four step layer To show stack work going use following data example The application layer make sure data sent format understandable recipient
This mean formatting data sent standard way applicable application example HTTP FTP etc
In case going wrap piece data XML tag
The transport layer look data sent split chunk fit data packet
It attache number specifying packet order allows recipient place data back together correctly end
To packet attache port number dependent application used
For example send data port The network layer attache IP address sender recipient know sent send confirmation message
It must also attach IP address host sending data get lost
In case sending sending
Combined port number creates data sent socket data sent namely Finally link layer attache MAC address sender recipient allowing packet directed specific network interface IP Address host machine
In case sender using wireless card MAC address destination MAC address These four packet sent across internet holding enough information great job ensuring data request sent correctly data send received
However seen sometimes data get lost internet packet arrive order differing one sent
With something like computer game telecommunication ca wait slow packet find way across internet
This would result voice message slowing computer game becoming unresponsive
There another protocol called ask confirmation data packet received
This protocol used heavily networked computer game voice IP wo impact badly overall game experience voice conversation
When play computer game might see something say lost packet xyz web meeting quality voice video might briefly degrade
This packet loss action result using UDP
Name describe four level stack Combined IP address Port Number make
Socket What MAC Address stack
A MAC address unique identifier assigned network device
It used Link layer direct message particular network interface designated IP address Show step involved sending following data Web page construction HTML style sheet Web page essential part many people live life perform job

This known
In philosopher posed thought experiment see proving machine understand
The box man sits
He speak Chinese passed Chinese character door
He book Chinese character matching response

reaction basically hard forget way David Ferrucci told long ago
Ferrucci senior manager Semantic Analysis Integration department head Watson project I met first time last November lab
An researcher long specialized system Ferrucci chafed slow progress field
A fixture office evening weekend witty voluble intense
While dining recently wife asked waiter meal included dairy
lactose intolerant waiter inquired
wife replied generally Ferrucci told recently prescribed mouth guard stress watching Watson play clenching teeth excessively
Ferrucci never aficionado certainly seen said shrug
big But craved ambitious goal would impel break new ground would verge science fiction fit bill
computer machine say
understands asking provides right chunk response needed
When computer going get point computer know talk
What make language hard computer Ferrucci explained full When people decode someone else saying easily unpack many nuanced allusion connotation every sentence
He gave example form clue name hat elementary dear People readily detect wordplay echo dear Watson famous phrase associated immediately recall Hollywood version Holmes sport deerstalker hat
But computer simple way identify dear wordplay
Cleverly matching different keywords even different fragment sentence part search engine work day enough either
Type clue Google get referral dear none deerstalker hat
even computer determines actual underlying question sort hat Sherlock Holmes wear data may stored way enables extract precise answer
For year computer scientist built system creating specialized database certain fact world recorded linked together
You could Sherlock Holmes building database includes connection catchphrase hat
But database would pretty narrow able answer question nuclear power fish specie history
Those would require database
Pretty soon face impossible task organizing information known man ocean Ferrucci put
In computer science known problem
And even could get past might face issue database contains fact input manually break time ask question something beyond material
way database would include answer every clue subject matter potentially human knowledge
The great shift artificial intelligence began last year computer scientist began using statistic analyze huge pile document like book news story
They wrote algorithm could take subject automatically learn type word statistically speaking least associated
Using method could put hundred article book movie review discussing Sherlock Holmes computer would calculate word frequently correlated one another say
So point could present computer question mention Sherlock Holmes name machine detected certain associated word could conclude Holmes probable subject could also identify hundred concept word present likely related Holmes like In theory sort statistical computation possible decade impractical
Computers fast enough expansive enough case easy way put million document computer
All changed early
Computer power became drastically cheaper amount online text exploded million people wrote blog wikis anything everything news organization academic journal also began putting work digital format

Still best system remained nowhere near able take In Ferrucci tested advanced system best field near top giving question previous show
The result dismal
He showed chart prepared champion perform TV show

could one finally play If firm focused computer firepower including new server challenge Ferrucci could conduct experiment dozen time faster anyone allowing feed information Watson test new algorithm quickly

interest spending next five year life pursuing thing small said
wanted push If could succeed soon could bring underlying technology market customizable system
In boss gave three five year increased team people
breakthrough design single brilliant new technique analyzing language
Indeed many statistical technique Watson employ already well known computer scientist
One important thing make Watson different enormous speed memory
Taking advantage supercomputing heft team input million document Watson build knowledge base including say reference material sort dictionary thesaurus folksonomies taxonomy encyclopedia kind reference material imagine getting hand licensing
Novels bible speed allows try thousand way simultaneously tackling clue
Most system rely handful algorithm Ferrucci decided system work well single algorithm simulate human ability parse language fact
Instead Watson us hundred algorithm time analyze question different way generating hundred possible solution
Another set algorithm rank answer according plausibility example dozen algorithm working different direction arrive answer likely right one
In essence Watson think probability
It produce one single answer enormous number possibility rank assessing likely one answer question
Ferrucci showed Watson handled sample clue presidentially pardoned In first pas algorithm came To evaluate whether best response Watson performed clever trick inserted answer original phrase presidentially pardoned ran new search see also produced result supported right answer

The new search returned result pardoned Nixon phrasing similar original clue helped make solution
Other time Watson us algorithm perform basic time space help detect answer seems better

Human memory frail
In game like player panic becoming unable recall fact would otherwise remember without difficulty
Watson problem
It might trouble analysis unable logically connect relevant piece text question
But forget thing
Plus reaction simply beat human buzzer every time
relying nerve old nerve Dorothy Gilmartin complained halfway first game seemed Watson winning almost every buzz
Yet truth game I witnessed Watson former player human frequently beat Watson buzzer
Their advantage lay way game set
On new clue given pop screen visible
Watson get text electronically moment
But contestant allowed hit buzzer host finished reading question aloud average take host six seven second read clue
Players use precious interval figure whether enough confidence answer hazard hitting buzzer
After buzzing carry risk someone win buzz question answer incorrectly loses
Often six seven second enough time Watson
The human reacted quickly
For example one game clue pick crave broccoli A human contestant jumped buzzer soon could
Watson meanwhile still processing
Its top five answer appeared screen yet
When finally came I could see took long
Something question confused computer answer came mere sliver confidence
The top two correct answer third guess
To avoid losing money Watson care money obviously winning simply way
see fast accurately system performing team programmed Watson generally buzz arrives answer high confidence level
In regard Watson actually disadvantage best player regularly hit buzzer soon possible even figured clue
rule give five second answer winning buzz
So long good feeling gut pounce buzzer trusting extra second answer pop head
Ferrucci told best human contestant brought play Watson amazingly fast
buzz millisecond said sounding astonished
millisecond On third day I watched Watson play quite poorly losing four seven game one case without winning
Often Watson appeared misunderstand clue offered answer inexplicable audience erupted laughter
Faced clue gangster hit man Murder Incorporated Watson responded Up screen I could see none lesser choice correct one Later asked complete phrase feeling Watson offered anymore incorrect since precise phrasing simply anymore strict phrasing
When I looked screen I noticed answer Watson ranked lower pretty odd including Porcaro keyboardist band Toto made vague sort sense really
In another game logic appeared fall odd semantic rabbit hole repeatedly giving answer name Hollywood actor several clue nothing
Advertisement In corner conference room Ferrucci sat typing laptop
Whenever Watson got question wrong Ferrucci winced stamped foot frustration like coach watching dropped pass
added laughing
Seeing error sometimes get sense cognitive shortcoming
For example category heading often includes bit wordplay explains clue addressed
Watson sometimes appeared mistakenly analyze entire category thus botch every clue
One game included category indicated every clue would list several answer relevant state
Watson clearly grasp answered repeatedly
I also noticed Watson faced short clue one word two often seemed lose race buzzer possibly host read clue quickly Watson enough time full calculation
The human contrast simply trusted gut jumped
Ferrucci refused talk record blind spot
aware indeed team game tracing Watson messed
But terrified competitor knew type question Watson bad could prepare boning specific area

required contestant sign nondisclosure agreement prohibiting discussing observation precisely Watson good bad
I signed agreement I free describe I saw Ferrucci make easier cataloguing vulnerability
Computer scientist I spoke agreed witty allusive clue probably weak point
obscure Italian poet easy Watson never forget one Peter Norvig director research Google told
tends lot wordplay going Certainly many occasion seemed true
Still time I startled eerily humanlike ability untangle astonishingly coy clue
During one game category Before After indicating clue would hint two different thing need blended together one included name The clue star go existential French author Watson nailed perfectly Ultimately greatest edge probably perfect memory lightning speed
It lack emotion
emotion enormous part Bob Harris champion told
single time ever missed Daily Double I always miss next clue still kicking Because short period next clue come along stress carry
Similarly human become much intimidated clue one expensive clue presumably written much harder
Whether Watson win go TV real match depends pit computer
Watson appear contestant regular show instead hold special match pitting Watson one famous winner past
If contest includes Ken Jennings best player history game row Watson lose performance improve
pretty far cloud yet level sparring match Watson beaten several time opponent nowhere near well Jennings
Indeed sometimes lost people placed first appearance show
The executive producer Harry Friedman say picking play Watson refused let Jennings interviewed story suggestive
Ferrucci say team continue Watson improving performance getting harder
first started add new algorithm would improve performance percent percent say
like half percent good attitude toward winning conflicted
I could see hunger win
And losing badly national TV might mean negative publicity
But Ferrucci also argued Watson might lose merely bad luck

Whereas common digital computing requires data encoded binary digit always one two definite state quantum computation us state
A theoretical model computer also known universal quantum computer
The field quantum computing initiated work
A quantum computer spin quantum bit also formulated use quantum
As development actual quantum computer still infancy experiment carried quantum computational operation executed small number quantum bit

A small quantum computer exists available hobbyist experiment via project
Along IBM computer company called also developing version quantum computer us process called
quantum computer would theoretically able solve certain problem much quickly classical computer use even best currently known like using
There exist run faster possible probabilistic classical algorithm
A classical computer could principle simulate quantum algorithm quantum computation violate
On hand quantum computer may able efficiently solve problem feasible classical computer
A classical computer made bit represented either one zero
A quantum computer maintains sequence
A single qubit represent one zero two pair qubits quantum superposition state three qubits superposition state
In general quantum computer qubits arbitrary superposition different state simultaneously compare normal computer state one time
A quantum computer operates qubits using also alters observed state
An composed fixed sequence problem encoded setting initial value qubits similar classical computer work
The calculation usually end measurement collapsing system qubits one pure state qubit zero one decomposing classical state
The outcome therefore classical bit information algorithm end measurement result unobserved quantum state
Quantum algorithm often probabilistic provide correct solution certain known probability
Note term computing must used case mean probabilistic computing term different meaning computer science
An example implementation qubits quantum computer could start use particle two state typically written
This true system mapped onto effective system
A quantum computer given number qubits fundamentally different classical computer composed number classical bit
For example representing state system classical computer requires storage coefficient characterize state classical system sufficient provide value bit number
Although fact may seem indicate qubits hold exponentially information classical counterpart care must taken overlook fact qubits probabilistic superposition state
This mean final state qubits measured found one possible configuration measurement
It generally incorrect think system qubits one particular state measurement since fact superposition state measurement made directly affect possible outcome computation
To better understand point consider classical computer operates
If exact state register given time known described probability distribution different string
If uncertainty state exactly one state probability
However possibility number different state
The state quantum computer similarly described one dimensional vector vector node holding amplitude state bit string qubits
Here however coefficient sum coefficient must equal
For absolute value squared give probability system found measurement state
However complex number encodes magnitude also direction phase difference two coefficient state represents meaningful parameter
This fundamental difference quantum computing probabilistic classical computing
If measure three qubits observe string
The probability measuring given string squared magnitude string coefficient probability measuring probability measuring etc
Thus measuring quantum state described complex coefficient give classical probability distribution say quantum state collapse classical state result making measurement
An vector specified many different way depending chosen space
The basis bit string known computational basis
Other possible base vector eigenvectors
often used make choice basis explicit
For example state computational basis written The computational basis single qubit two dimension
Using eigenvectors operator single qubit
While classical state quantum state manipulated quite differently classical quantum computation
For computing either case system must initialized example string corresponding vector
In classical randomized computation system evolves according application preserve probability add one preserve
In quantum computation hand allowed operation effectively rotation preserve sum square add one
Exactly unitaries applied depend physic quantum device
Consequently since rotation undone rotating backward quantum computation
Technically quantum operation probabilistic combination unitaries quantum computation really generalize classical computation
See precise formulation
Finally upon termination algorithm result need read
In case classical computer register obtain one definite string say
Quantum mechanically one state equivalent collapsing quantum state classical distribution coefficient classical state squared magnitude coefficient quantum state described followed sampling distribution
This destroys original quantum state
Many algorithm give correct answer certain probability
However repeatedly initializing running measuring quantum computer result probability getting correct answer increased
In contrast allows correct answer inferred quantum computer actually running technical sense though earlier initialization frequent measurement part counterfactual computation protocol
For detail sequence operation used various see
underpins security system believed computationally infeasible ordinary computer large integer product product two prime
By comparison quantum computer could efficiently solve problem using find factor
This ability would allow quantum computer decrypt many system use today sense would number digit integer algorithm solving problem
In particular popular based difficulty factoring integer problem solved Shor algorithm
In particular algorithm could broken
These used protect secure Web page encrypted email many type data
Breaking would significant ramification electronic privacy security
However appear broken algorithm
Some algorithm based problem integer factorization discrete logarithm problem Shor algorithm applies like based problem
also known broken quantum computer finding polynomial time algorithm solving would break many lattice based cryptosystems open problem
It proven applying Grover algorithm break brute force requires time equal roughly invocation underlying cryptographic algorithm compared roughly classical case meaning symmetric key length effectively halved would security attack using Grover algorithm classical search see
could potentially fulfill function public key cryptography
Besides factorization discrete logarithm quantum algorithm offering polynomial speedup best known classical algorithm found several problem including simulation quantum physical process chemistry solid state physic approximation solving
No mathematical proof found show equally fast classical algorithm discovered although considered unlikely
For problem quantum computer offer polynomial speedup
The example solved using quadratically fewer query database required classical algorithm
In case advantage provable
Several example provable quantum speedup query problem subsequently discovered finding collision function evaluating NAND tree
Consider problem four property An example attempt guess password file assuming password maximum possible length
For problem four property time quantum computer solve proportional square root number input
It used attack attempting guess secret key
also used obtain quadratic search class problem known
Since chemistry nanotechnology rely understanding quantum system system impossible simulate efficient manner classically many believe one important application quantum computing
Quantum simulation could also used simulate behavior atom particle unusual condition reaction inside
introduced term refer hypothetical speedup advantage quantum computer would classical computer certain field
announced expects achieve quantum supremacy end say best classical computer beaten task within five year
Quantum supremacy achieved yet skeptic like Gil Kalai doubt ever
Bill Unruh doubted practicality quantum computer paper published back
Paul Davies pointed computer would even come conflict cosmological information bound implied
Those Roger Schlafly pointed claimed theoretical benefit quantum computing go beyond proven theory quantum mechanic imply interpretation multiple world negative probability
Schlafly maintains Born rule metaphysical fluff quantum mechanic rely probability branch science simply calculates expected value observables
He also point argument Turing complexity run backwards
Those prefer Bayesian interpretation quantum mechanic questioned physical nature mathematical abstraction employed
There number technical challenge building quantum computer thus far quantum computer yet solve problem faster classical computer
IBM listed following practical quantum computer One greatest challenge controlling removing
This usually mean isolating system environment interaction external world cause system decohere
However source decoherence also exist
Examples include quantum gate lattice vibration background thermonuclear spin physical system used implement qubits
Decoherence irreversible effectively usually something highly controlled avoided
Decoherence time candidate system particular transverse relaxation time technology also called typically range nanosecond second low temperature
Currently quantum computer require qubits cooled millikelvins order prevent significant decoherence
As result time consuming task may render quantum algorithm inoperable maintaining state qubits long enough duration eventually corrupt superposition
These issue difficult optical approach timescales order magnitude shorter approach overcoming optical
Error rate typically proportional ratio operating time decoherence time hence operation must completed much quickly decoherence time
If error rate small enough thought possible use quantum error correction corrects error due decoherence thereby allowing total calculation time longer decoherence time
An often cited figure required error rate gate
This implies gate must able perform task one coherence time system
Meeting scalability condition possible wide range system
However use error correction brings cost greatly increased number required qubits
The number required factor integer using Shor algorithm still polynomial thought number qubits number factored error correction algorithm would inflate figure additional factor
For number implies need bit without error correction
With error correction figure would rise bit

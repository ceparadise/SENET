In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Computer Science Fundamentals Acccelerated hour course designed year old student
It taught week school club integrated unit longer technology class used intro computer science class
Students learn create computer program help learn collaborate others develop skill persist difficult task

Let say web service located WSDL
Is endpoint URI web service SOAP message received unmarshalled
Could please explain purpose
This shorter hopefully clearer answer
Yes endpoint URL service accessed client application
The web service multiple endpoint example order make available using different protocol
Updated answer Peter comment This de old terminology use directally translated port endpoint
Maybe find answer document A WSDL document defines service collection network endpoint port
In WSDL abstract definition endpoint message separated concrete network deployment data format binding
This allows reuse abstract definition message abstract description data exchanged port type abstract collection operation
The concrete protocol data format specification particular port type constitutes reusable binding
A port defined associating network address reusable binding collection port define service
Hence WSDL document us following element definition network service The endpoint connection point HTML file active server page exposed
Endpoints provide information needed address Web service endpoint
The endpoint provides reference specification used define group family message addressing property give message characteristic reference source destination endpoint identity message allow uniform addressing independent message
The endpoint PC PDA terminal
A web service endpoint URL another would use communicate program
To see WSDL add web service endpoint URL
Web service interaction web page interaction
So Endpoint Therefore WSDL To expand element WSDL I always find helpful compare code A WSDL portion physical abstract
Definitions variable ex myVar x etc
Types data type ex int double String myObjectType Operations ex myMethod myFunction etc
Messages input parameter return type Porttypes class
container operation ex MyClass etc
Binding connect porttypes define chosen protocol communicating web service
protocol form communication phone email etc
Service list address another program find web service

In past project I worked endpoint relative property
That say may may appended always contained
If service called dynamic part example part would get added endpoint
But many time endpoint could used without amended
Whats important understand endpoint help
For example alternative way pas information stored endpoint would store different part endpoint separate property
For example Or host port across multiple service In case full URL would need constructed code In contract stored endpoint And yes many time stored endpoint including
This lead code like Hope shed light
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

I know I know vote close neither answer dozen answer I read reread across wide wide web really define term least way would earn respectable grade language exam administered class
Technical writer appear whole different idea
All due respect consider answer thread begin An endpoint service expose WCF term made three thing
Okay utilized attribute
It address binding contract easy
Any good student know Binding abstruse term communication mechanism Contract actually part service
So endpoint must defined Address
The URL endpoint reached
Um canonical Lowy answer also cited thread
An excerpt part repeat The endpoint fusion address contract binding
Every endpoint must three element host expose endpoint
That like saying duck fusion walking like duck quacking like duck looking like duck animal kingdom expose duck
All snark aside idle gadfly curiosity hard master concept whose explanation fail explain
So endpoint WCF
An endpoint really aggregation thing entity concept exists right
To extend duck analogy like trying define quack quack aggregation air moving duck vocal cord travelling space interpretted brain
There quack point define separately outside term
An endpoint represents something external client call ask service something optionally get answer data returned
As Ladislav say entry point service functionality
In order define client call upon need contract interface definition
To define client send data receive answer need binding
To define request must sent define address
If define one endpoint
We simply say endpoint exposed shorthand service defines contract C binding B address A ABC
Endpoint physical interface boundary service three main property Service multiple endpoint different ABC
Btw
WCF term
WCF brought term WSDL
Endpoint usually contract service using interface using

Is way get binding WCF service using object instance service class
I currently debugging WCF service changed client binding want see one applied proxy class represents service interface
As aside proxy class created using method
However MVC web application method call done via Dependency Injection
So proxy object injected code
So clear point code I using proxy object I access original ChannelFactory
I know binding ChannelFactory using set whilst configuring dependency injection container within class
However using dependency injection guarantee ChannelFactory indeed binding defined one used create proxy object might changed code
The issue I changing explicitly setting value binding used class setting taking affect make suspicous another binding used
You get binding Endpoint object service By posting answer agree

According Wikipedia endpoint Louisville Kentucky
A common definition computer networking architecture operation however mobile device laptop phone tablet
The term origin reference computer network
The endpoint device node connected LAN WAN accepts communication back forth across network
In traditional sense endpoint
It also could digital telephone handset router printer workstation server
Yet today used commonly network security end user mobility circle mean That could laptop tablet mobile phone edge periphery network individual connect central network
Endpoint use increasing business world due workforce mobility I mean rarity ever office much le tethered desk
Traditional protocol designed desktop
With data outside firewall endpoint device IT need deal security communication real time across varying location bandwidth possibly insecure apps loaded number device consistent exposure malware across Internet protocol
IT team solve challenge endpoint using variety technology virtual private network VPNs enable safe connection main managed network
Cloud endpoint backup technology like Druva
also enable backup data endpoint minimizing risk data loss
They also give IT tool manage corporate data endpoint ability remote wipe create trusted data store cloud
Ironically endpoint fast becoming common way compute communicate local fixed machine derived
The notion safe secure network insecure endpoint fast giving way modern concept computing across device network security protecting company user across local storage

All communication Windows Communication Foundation WCF service occurs service
Endpoints provide client access functionality offered WCF service
Each endpoint consists four property An address indicates endpoint found
A binding specifies client communicate endpoint
A contract identifies operation available
A set behavior specify local implementation detail endpoint
This topic discus endpoint structure explains represented WCF object model
Each endpoint consists following Address The address uniquely identifies endpoint tell potential consumer service located
It represented WCF object model class
An class contains A property represents address service
An property represents security identity service collection optional message header
The optional message header used provide additional detailed addressing information identify interact endpoint
For information see
Binding The binding specifies communicate endpoint
This includes The transport protocol use example TCP HTTP
The encoding use message example text binary
The necessary security requirement example SSL SOAP message security
For information see
A binding represented WCF object model abstract base class
For scenario user use one binding
For information see
Contracts The contract outline functionality endpoint expose client
A contract specifies What operation called client
The form message
The type input parameter data required call operation
What type processing response message client expect
For information defining contract see
Behaviors You use endpoint behavior customize local behavior service endpoint
Endpoint behavior achieve participating process building WCFruntime
An example endpoint behavior property allows specify different listening address SOAP Web Services Description Language WSDL address
For information see
You specify endpoint service either imperatively using code declaratively configuration
For information see
This section explains purpose binding endpoint address show configure binding endpoint demonstrates use behavior property
Describes endpoint addressed WCF
Describes binding used specify transport encoding protocol detail required client service communicate
Describes contract define method service
Describes create service endpoint configuration
Describes create service endpoint code
Describes detect error service implementation configuration without hosting service using

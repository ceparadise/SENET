At heart concept lie idea whatever deliver delivered error free start project
It quite costly fix error later project
Now possible ensure deliverable error free
The answer simple We put appropriate process place help u producing error free deliverable every time deliverable produced
However always deviation even best process
That also put control place measure result make adjustment necessary
Therefore quality assurance process used preventing defect quality control measurement place detect repair remaining defect
Let u take look process individually understand better The perform quality assurance executing process primarily concerned overall process improvement ensure time deliverable produced error free
If quality process activity improved quality product also improve along overall reduction cost
Quality Assurance begin early continues throughout life cycle project
Since process us output plan quality process performed performed
key tool used process
Quality audit enable u review project evaluate activity taking place project improved meet quality standard
Quality audit dual objective improving acceptance product improving overall cost quality
The quality assurance department performs audit periodically part executing process looking quality control measurement see indication standard policy plan procedure followed procedure producing expected quality result
This department also issue change request including notification area need preventive action corrective action defect repair
In addition quality assurance department look project best practice improvement process used throughout organization
The perform quality control monitoring controlling process look specific result determine conform quality standard
This process involves project product deliverable done throughout project life cycle
This process typically us statistical sampling rather looking every output
There lot sampling technique used various industry practice often complex tailored industry
The quality control process us tool inspection make sure result work supposed
This process make sure everything produced meet quality standard
This process performed beginning production first product deliverable continues deliverable accepted
The quality control department measure performance project start planning project end standard policy plan procedure
As result measurement department also issue change request including notification area need preventive action corrective action defect repair
Let u take look example understand two process better
Let u assume manufacturing laptop
In Quality Assurance need put process place ensure laptop manufactured defect would include type manufacturing equipment used training people documenting production Control come play fact testing finished product

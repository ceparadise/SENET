The baseline function measure project deviate
Establishing baseline happens project start otherwise project manager system measure
When client request change team member determine project requires change baseline document change well
Updating information allows team member remain current progress project ensures record change
Project team examine baseline document closing project
They review document determine whether project meet specification
If discrepancy team must address issue determine want make adjustment project
If team decides make change ensure conformance thing must consider
First must consider quality trying achieve
When final product high quality project cost
They must also consider schedule
Making change nearly completed project add additional time project
Costs always important factor project

Before create solution need fully understand problem
In technical architecture known model
In word work client determine system currently work build model using Architecture Design Language diagram create document establishing baseline create solution
With input client create model Inisope company directory service using Archimate
Include page document support explain model
NOTE Updating company directory involves changing record
For example someone fired taken payroll database removed employee directory position going away Human Resources post job ad new employee

So I guessing new Computer Science curriculum coming little worried way ass student
At Uppingham Community College started developing way assessing student coming year
There many different subject plan covering
Some unit covering include Each subject map new curriculum different way
It decided create grid mapping progress time
Each student going marked following category based strength
A student working lower end Basic computing knowledge given level
Now I know government want get away using level framework still need way monitoring progress time
We mapped unit work fit object
Each student going list objective shown unit across year next name
This way able map progress unit shown grid
Now probably
earth I going ass student came
In order help u good idea student knowledge
We put together baseline test test student ability problem solve think logically
This help u sort idea type thinking
The idea split curriculum section
It allows u focus various level ability
If would like use assessment technique school test using
Feel free download
I hope useful overall
If query assessment please feel free drop email Here example plan breaking Python unit Good Luck September

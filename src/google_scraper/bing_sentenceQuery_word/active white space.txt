blank character represent space character
The character whitespace



White space always active element good design
also referred negative space
White space always occurring design moment open blank document design begun white space
There two type white space undefined white space get open new document active white space occurs object place undefined white space
Just clarify misconception white space mean white colour whether black brown white

also designer make important element design used properly misunderstood wasted space

really designer place type shape would create interesting background would foreground
White space allows This refers flow element design whether type shape
White space allows reader easily engage design without confronted many graphic type
It allows reader powered design
enough balance foreground background
As human being need space
nature apply understanding human nature design first foremost want reader comfortable design unless sole purpose otherwise
This principle design like director behind camera
He directs make sure everything flow smoothly
Just like UNITY principle subtly steer design designer paying attention
Unity responsible element design holistic agreement
Even idea communicate contrast unity
making design work element work well
If type contrast shape colour balance playing role bring unity design
This refers easily shape letter distinguished usually refers larger size readability refers easily type read
Balance refers weight design based object element design
By weight I simply mean amount element design
Balance either symmetrical asymmetrical
Symmetrical design design divided half weight side
Make mistake
need side element object long weight even
symmetrical case
identical side
Asymmetrical obviously opposite symmetrical whereby divided
balanced side
White space help creates either type balance make work effective manner
Well starter used every medium design whether design illustration abstract artwork photography used anywhere
In web design white space crucial
Some designer go overboard think design adding fact
taking away adding enough
Some cleanest corporate site limited content main page content driven website make sure place space text
White space used way print layout like magazine spread way
used web
In fact great web design borrows entire concept web space printed medium
In illustration abstract artwork
entirely artist
I
believe
rule followed use white space
I
say someone us use
creative

In series character represent horizontal vertical
When rendered whitespace character correspond visible mark typically occupy area page
For example common whitespace symbol HTML also represents punctuation character text used Western
With many keyboard layout horizontal whitespace character may entered use
Horizontal white space may also entered many keyboard use key although length space may vary
Vertical white space bit varied encoded obvious typing result creates code sequence application program
Older keyboard might instead say abbreviating typewriter keyboard meaning generated electromechanical return left stop CR code line feed move next line LF code application independently used draw text cell based display monitor printing might also contain reverse code sequence allowing yesterday text base fancier display
Many early computer game used code draw screen

The term white space based resulting appearance ordinary
However coded inside application white space processed character code program proper action defined context occur
The common whitespace character may typed via
Depending context generated return may considered white space well
The table list character defined whitespace WS character Character Database
Seventeen use definition white space consistent algorithm Bidirectional Character known character
The remaining character may also used Bidi type
Unicode also provides visible character used represent white space differ represent white space screen represent space end line longer screen column width
In case space shown simply blank space case may represented symbol
Many different character described could used produce space function margin tab setting also affect white space
In computer normal Unicode character whose width vary according design typeface
Typical value range em em digital typography equal nominal size font font space probably point
Sophisticated font may differently sized space bold italic face often compositor manually adjust width space depending size prominence text
In addition space possible encode space specific width
See table complete list
used parenthetical divider used word joiner usually set continuous text
However dash optionally surrounded
The hair space written HTML using named entity universally supported browser yet
The thin space named entity numeric reference
These space much thinner normal space except hair space thinner two
In syntax space frequently used explicitly separate
Runs whitespace character beyond first occurring within written computer outside string quoted region ignored language language called
In language including white space indentation used syntactical purpose
In satirical language called whitespace character valid character programming character ignored
Still programming language excessive use white space especially end line considered nuisance
However correct use white space make code easier read help group related logic
The defines white space character space horizontal tab vertical tab
The network protocol requires different type white space used different part protocol space character line CRLF end line linear white space header value
In command processed script typed space character cause problem two possible function part command parameter parameter name
Ambiguity prevented either prohibiting embedded space enclosing name embedded space quote character
Some markup language preserve white space written
Web markup language treat whitespace character specially including space character programmer convenience
One space character read conforming processor collapsed space depending semantic context
For example double space within text collapsed single space space appear either side separate attribute name value effect interpretation document
Element end tag contain trailing space tag XML contain space
In language unnecessary white space increase file size may slow network transfer
On hand unnecessary white space also inconspicuously mark code similar le obvious comment code
This desirable prove license copyright committed
In XML attribute value sequence whitespace character treated single space document read parser
White space XML element content changed way parser application receiving information parser may choose apply similar rule element content
An XML document author use attribute element instruct parser discourage downstream application altering white space element content
In sequence whitespace character treated single may manifest single space character rendering text language normally insert space word
Conforming HTML renderers required apply literal treatment white space within prescribed element tag element used apply whitespace processing
In element space character collapsed separator
In XML HTML character along standard space treated collapsible white space subject rule
Such usage similar multiword file name written operating system application confused embedded space file name instead use word separator
Another symbol
This used early year computer programming writing coding form
Keypunch operator immediately recognized symbol explicit space

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I see language specifies reserved word delimiters whitespaces lexer section
Are delimiters like reserved identifier punctuation space additioinal function regarding skipping whitespace
Namely spec say Each lexical element either delimiter identifier may reserved word abstract literal character literal string literal bit string literal comment
In case explicit separator required separate adjacent lexical element namely without separation interpretation single lexical element possible
A separator either space character SPACE NBSP format effector end line
I also see definition delimiter
I understand difference
Moreover special character part I understand deliver character path parser
Anyway I wonder piece text smashed like
Mine current lexer produce followed identifier
However I feel others
What common practice lexing whitespace skipping whitespace mandatory optional
How specify
I ask see specify lot whitespace separator production rule
Despite stuff must ubequitos practice I see
In JavaCC instance rest
What convention
I see
What purpose
I guess I supplement every definition identifier delimiter literal optional whitespace prefix
Now right identifier literal separated delimiters whitespace
How I ensure
Now right identifier literal separated delimiters whitespace
How I ensure
If right mean case every programming language right probably lexical statement would either
In many language integer literal separated following identifier language
In language different identifier number class token require explicit separation
If consider delimiters say identifier need separated whitespace delimiters either since normally valid
Maximal munch common lexical algorithm
This view input sequence lexeme lexeme start precisely following previous lexeme continues far possible two lexeme possible given point source code longest one chosen regardless whether rest input would valid
Not lexeme token set lexeme includes ignorable whitespace example recognized tokeniser otherwise participate syntactic analysis
However language idiosyncratic exception
Consider handling D require explicit exception rule
A different issue handling literal ECMAscript language could tokenised simple operator token could first part regular expression literal
Which option chosen depends immediate syntactic context
Yet another deviation model found language like Python Haskell layout whitespace used indententation sometimes syntactic
To extent language specification us maximal munch algorithm whitespace mandatory context would produce different tokenisation
In language whitespace always discarded tokenisation need ensure supplied
There global institution regulates computer language designer
Each language community develops according philosophy custom eccentricity equivocation higher truth one appeal
Particular language may based different tokenisation model make general statement based behaviour single language
In comment stream suggested question actually applies VHDL VHDL conform maximal munch model
The text cited OP apparently come section VHDL Reference Manual
However seems clear even text quoted OP design much different
I repeat emphasis added The text design unit sequence separate lexical element
Each lexical element either delimiter identifier may reserved word abstract literal character literal string literal bit string literal comment
A separator either space character SPACE NBSP format effector end line
A space character SPACE NBSP separator except within comment string literal space character literal
So make clear case separation obligatory concatenated token could tokenised longer combined token essentially rule
As interesting example white space absolutely important Swift language
Take character match parsing rule operator
But binary unary operator unary bind left right
It depends white space White space left right left unary example x
White space right lift right unary example x invalid right unary minus operator
White space side neither side binary operator x x z x z x invalid

White Space started spreading internet access unconnected area
Here need know confusing emerging technology
By White Space stand transform way purchase use wireless internet
It yet widely adopted unlicensed free form broadband gaining traction
Here thing know get speed disruptive technology
White Space refers unused broadcasting frequency wireless spectrum
Television network leave gap channel buffering purpose space wireless spectrum similar used used deliver widespread broadband internet
Typical home travel two wall
White Space broadband travel kilometer vegetation building obstacle
Tablets phone computer access wireless internet using White Space fixed portable power station
The actual amount spectrum vary region White Space spectrum range MHz Mhz
So laptop hardware connect straight broadband spectrum
Not yet according Alan Stillwell incentive auction advisor FCC Office Engineering Technology OET
If want use TVWS TV White Space existing laptop would need separate device Stillwell said
The TVWS device use right serve computer tower laptop tablet directly
They provide link receiver connected regular WiFi hub
In Wilmington North Carolina implemented White Space technology connect city infrastructure allowing public official remotely turn light park provide public wireless broadband certain area city monitor water level
At West Virginia University White Space technology used power
It started wireless internet campus public transit platform transport student day
WVU first campus utilize White Space broadband internet
The FCC Office Engineering Technology OET approved four TVWS TV White Space database seven model device power
Portable device yet available fixed device offer internet service rural area business residence institution according Stillwell
The Gigabit Libraries program using TVWS device deliver Internet service local library number operator rural area using device provide service home business rural area said
We expect number device us grow time go
Currently thousand fixed device already deployed added
Google Microsoft already chasing emerging White Space market Africa percent population online
Because wave travel kilometer radius great remote village
Google Microsoft also invested White Space technology developing country
recently launched program school Cape Town South Africa
Microsoft initiative throughout continent hoping bring million people online project place Tanzania South Africa
Rural area abroad often inhibited wireless access inaccessible local power grid
Cell tower difficult install ca connect either
Fortunately White Space power station charged solar panel excess electricity generated also area school
That add another dimension African country example hard find electricity use solar power keep running Mody said
Rural area people received good broadband service past present perfect place start using White Space technology said Apurva Mody chairman organization study promotes deployment White Space broadband internet
One biggest problem rural area meet device point house separated longer distance difficult cable fiber optic meet added
The traditional structure go five kilometer
With cell tower device White Space technology travel kilometer service many customer one time
The FCC data every individual location device since use unlicensed basis two investing White Space rural area
Spectrum Bridge telecommunication software company one first database certified FCC
The company worked Dell Google Microsoft deploy experimental broadband network
Spectrum Bridge several tool website show much White Space available including
Unlicensed spectrum provides opportunity free wireless local distribution internet service
Stillwell said
The demand unlicensed spectrum using technology GHz Ghz growing high rate growth expected continue foreseeable future
Microsoft implemented White Space project throughout Asia including recent deployment Singapore partnership Singapore government research agency UK wireless service provider area vegetation make wireless access difficult
In conjunction project Europe also creating database White Space much like Google
The FCC introduced incentive auction
The auction voluntary way encourages licensee relinquish spectrum right exchange share proceeds auction new license
Congress authorized auction
Once incentive auction implemented Stillwell said amount spectrum local area clear service progress rapidly
Incentive auction biggest issue soon enough since already deployed wireless service one focused yet extra space available
Internet service provider ranked lowest customer service satisfaction industry America according recent survey
The two largest provider Comcast Time Warner ranked lowest internet service provider
However incentive auction could potentially allow private company like Comcast Time Warner purchase unlicensed broadband spectrum use
If FCC allows cable company internet provider buy section spectrum amount free unlicensed space drastically reduce size
So far FCC allowed internet service provider license White Space spectrum
Hopefully continue cautious allow purchase spectrum disruptive force connecting people internet

CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level
When come computer science student President Obama led way CS Student became first President write line code
His first line code moveForward CS All moving forward together
Who taught code
A student named Adrianna Newark New Jersey took computer science course school
If President start learning computer science
We know need basic tool make possible including teacher infrastructure
Thanks President well way making happen closing connectivity divide school half empowering million student broadband enlisting school district cause
And order make sure youth pathway workforce adult access skill President expanded city state rural area

Businesses philanthropy also played major role building movement expand CS nationally

A Post By A number week ago I wrote tip portrait photography composition technique
A similar tip action photography give moving subject space move
Some call space front moving subject photograph
Alternatively space behind subject often called dead space
The reason compositional technique used someone view image spot subject moving direction eye naturally move direction
It quite instinctive
Working way viewer instinctively view image help create balance drama anticipation shot
This technique creating active space action shot applied many type photography including sport car bike people etc wildlife photographing running animal virtually subject matter moving
Of course every rule time break one general I find work well

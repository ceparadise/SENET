We dedicated giving every student every school opportunity learn computer programming
Not day go I read article speech need invest STEM education invest future student national competitiveness etc
Every time I hear STEM Science Technology Engineering Math I wish could focus conversation computer science
Why
Because three reason I explain See chart
Computer science STEM field job student
The data come government comparing job data projection Bureau Labor Statistics student data National Science Foundation
In chart computer science categorized alongside mathematics separated distinction would even greater favor CS
Now look computer science see field annual job growth almost rate student graduating bachelor degree
Computing job growing every state every industry
show job software computing company core driver recovery
And picture show fraction growth opportunity
Across field STEM computer science occupation top highest demand list lowest unemployment rate across field
Computer science impacting everything banking retail manufacturing entertainment across every industry country enough computer scientist fill open job
Google diversity gap workforce
Both tell similar story tech company hire men woman
For year author STEM problem talk fixing gender gap STEM addressing education pipeline student STEM field
If ask parent student STEM mostly know
By contrast far people familiar term like biology chemistry
I ran Meanwhile huge disconnect meaning STEM depending audience
When politician businessmen leader talk importance STEM mostly referring new stuff new technology innovation advancement invention driving growth national competitiveness
But STEM translated practice public education system translate topic already taught today school algebra geometry calculus biology chemistry physic
One hundred percent US public school teach math science
But percent NOT teach computer science encouraged teach STEM increase funding STEM turn course already teach
I run nonprofit called focused bringing computer science school offering free curriculum support school want add course option
The biggest obstacle work enough school district administrator feel need teach computer science
They need hear parent important
If high school parent ask school district offer computer science proper course alongside algebra biology chemistry
Don ask technology computer STEM even coding
Ask computer science

befriending establishing emotional connection child sometimes family lower child inhibition objective
It also regularly lure minor various illicit business production
This crime proscribed various way since agreed multilateral treaty addressed problem international trafficking woman child nefarious purpose
The proscribed traffic international nature time
The concept gang groom neighbourhood victim defined UK
To establish good relationship child child family child groomers might several thing They might try gain child parent trust befriending goal easy access child
A trusting relationship family mean child parent le likely believe potential accusation
Child groomers might look time alone child done offering babysit groomers may also invite child sleepover opportunistic bed sharing
They might give gift money child exchange sexual contact apparent reason
Commonly show pornography child talk sexual topic child hoping make easy child accept act thus behavior
Hugging kissing physical contact even child want happen
Actions online communication defended suspected offender using fantasy defense accused argue expressing fantasy plan future behavior
In case law draw distinction two people accused grooming successfully used defense
Sexual grooming child also occurs
Some abuser pose child online make arrangement meet person
involved controversy whether take enough precaution
leader CEOP United Kingdom stated April office received complaint Facebook user year yet None complaint came direct Facebook
A spokesman Facebook responded complaint meeting Ceop directly person saying We take issue safety seriously
In implemented restriction purportedly intended help protect child adult seeking sexual conversation
In chat room investigated attorney general office allowing user create room whose name suggested used purpose
That October Yahoo
agreed implement policy procedure designed ensure room would allowed
Some vigilante organization use operative posing underage teen internet identify potential child molester turn information police court
The news program featured recurring segment based documenting activity
Similar group include
Multiple computer program developed help identify grooming warn parent
Such software analysis chat room log activity may identify grooming potentially suspicious activity
Some technology adapted social networking service ISPs
Sexual grooming child internet prevalent case amongst age group particularly year old child
The majority girl
The majority victimization occurs mobile phone support
Children teenager behavioral issue high attention seeking much higher risk others
The definition localised grooming given document follows form sexual exploitation previously referred street grooming medium child groomed sexually exploited offender initially met location outside home
This location usually public park cinema street friend house
Offenders often act together establishing relationship child child sexually exploiting
Some victim street grooming may believe offender fact older boyfriend victim introduce peer offender group might go sexually exploited well
Abuse may occur number location within region several occasion
Localised grooming term used CEOP intelligence request issued police force service agency order define data wished receive
Because grooming child although known time term UK proscribed early idea localised grooming coined around
A television documentary broadcast August reporter uncovered detail police social service investigation allegation young Asian Muslim men targeting girl sex drug prostitution West Yorkshire town
The Crop sought bring behaviour national attention since least
The saw November various conviction child sexual abuser
In various member convicted various count
The investigated
According Inside Out London BBC Inside Out investigation young British Sikh girl living outside Britain America particularly preyed upon men pretended Sikhs seduce groom
In report Committee addressed emerging issue violence child use new technology issue already covered Article Convention particular reference grooming internet
Some nation already criminalized grooming national legislation
Analysis law suggests may redundant existing legislation practice
Criminal Code Act section prohibits use carrier service communicate intent procure person age expose person indecent matter purpose grooming
The various state territory similar law use different age example victim Queensland
In Criminal Code section make offence communicate child computer system purpose committing sexual offence termed luring child
In since April Criminal Code section bi make offence seduce child electronic mean
With penalty one year imprisonment person mean attempt establish erotic sexual communication child year old
On January section added Dutch Criminal Code making online grooming child year old illegal
The maximum punishment year imprisonment fine fourth category
The law state crime meet intend meet intention performing unlawful sexual act person year
This recorded Section Crimes Act
This section labelled Meeting Young Person Following Sexual Grooming etc
Any person charged liable imprisonment term exceeding year
In section make offense arrange meeting child oneself someone else intent sexually abusing child
The meeting also criminalized
The offence carry maximum sentence year imprisonment automatic barring offender working child vulnerable adult
The Protection Children Prevention Sexual Offences Scotland Act introduced similar provision
Thus crime may committed even without actual meeting taking place without child involved meeting example police officer taken contact pretend child
In EWCA Crim appellant aged pretended befriend girl done little became suspicious reported approach
He number previous conviction including one described relentless predatory
The upheld eight year imprisonment extended license period two year
In make federal offense use mail interstate commerce etc
entice minor
make federal offense transmit information person age purpose
Some state additional statute covering seducing child online law make Use Computer Seduce Child
Laws focused first enforced federally Alabamian Jerry Alan Penton
Penton received year prison action coupled another distribution possession child pornography

Stephen worked Project Manager PMP certified well certified Scrum Alliance
Want watch later
Jeremy taken role company us Scrum project framework
He key stakeholder one responsible project requirement
Along various responsibility come Product Owner inherited product backlog previous Product Owner
He familiarity product backlog want make sure fully understands used also involvement effective possible
The prioritized grouping project work available development team work future sprint
repeated cycle work item fully developed tested
The Product Owner responsible content product backlog well priority order kept
It important product backlog take visual form used effectively
This could physical board virtual display combination two
The project work product backlog primarily take form identify specific user user desired functionality completed within sprint
User story related term functionality grouped
These often prioritized together taken sprint together
In addition user story project work take form structured way user story large complex need broken
These acceptable work item low priority
The highest priority item product backlog must user story form form development team effectively use
Once Jeremy fully understands definition makeup product backlog take look product backlog see example learned
He want see different form project work
These include user story feature epic
Jeremy current project build platform employee company
The goal ability communicate share information receive company update
Some user story focus ability internal user create user id password enter contact information upload picture
Each specific aspect functionality user create personal account
They grouped together feature product backlog
In addition user story also epic Jeremy product backlog
One epic backlog involves chat functionality
This epic rather user story two reason
The first reason time effort required accomplish would take one sprint
The second reason chat functionality broad broken user story
This item remain epic becomes high priority
In order effective Jeremy gained understanding product backlog general well understanding product backlog
While important useless unless understands done product backlog
This lead last area explores involvement product backlog
His involvement includes use maintenance
Get FREE access day create account
The primary use product backlog group available project work together priority order
This used team ready take new project work occurs meeting
The Product Owner present user story product backlog development team decides work take
A product backlog extremely useful meeting visually organized nature
In order effectively meet primary use product backlog must maintained Product Owner
Maintenance includes grooming prioritization
In grooming product backlog Product Owner remove item become unnecessary provide enough value
Prioritization involves making sure item taken next top backlog user story form
One additional use product backlog simply placeholder functionality need refining point
In traditional methodology work must fully established beginning project change
However unique aspect product backlog change evolve time like project work contains
This point epic acceptable product backlog
It beneficial able use placeholder come back roughly outlined item later enough known become priority
The grouping project work available development team take future decided meeting
It maintained keep priority order make sure item defined become higher priority
Work taken form grouped together

BNEI BRAK Israel year ago people Israel came Egypt Yitzik Crombie begin sitting office
He tell story faith tradition one unexpectedly end technology startup outskirt Tel Aviv
It Judaism align Crombie say thing could save insular community impoverished city Bnei Brak
The Jews integrated secular community explains
But need money need That Crombie business partner Racheli Ganot decided found tech incubator four month ago part Haredi Forum
The incubator specifically target Haredi community much life poverty line first kind
We thing startup Tel Aviv Crombie say
Just mile away lie bustling liberal Tel Aviv technology hub known around world innovation
We need bring Bnei Brak
Those Crombie community known Haredim meaning tremble God Hebrew cling tradition
Most men work many refuse perform compulsory military service devoting day learning Torah living meager state support
Making roughly percent population growing fast drawn much controversy Israelis saying take advantage state expense secular Israelis work serve Israeli Defense Forces
But recent year Haredi community taken world technology
Some Haredim even learn programming school program catering new job market
Crombie say frequently receives email Jews detailing big idea
But know say
The incubator program set last two year recently took startup providing funding percent Israeli government percent investor mentorship entrepreneur
Benjamin one participant program asked include last name say know bring idea market
When saw information incubator posted website say frequented religious developer immediately reached applied
They understand need religious people Benjamin explains holding iPhone photo map
He cousin came idea startup would turn map say Disney World Jerusalem interactive experience
We hope place help u say
While Crombie ardent advocate community say people face obstacle world
Some use computer Internet religious reason
And many like grow without much education English math science focusing instead studying religion
But course offered community people learning skill adult order enter field
Most notably sector changed life Haredi woman many work startup husband continue study Torah
Before woman worked confined traditionally female position like teacher
It new generation explains Chavi hardworking mother two worked Rachip six year
She asked use first name concern
With book Jewish prayer sitting next keyboard type away working project build chip satellite
She arrives early every morning leave early pick child school since husband get home late Torah study
It nice working say
We see reality worked hard
At Haredi Forum office Crombie startup iSale employ four men four woman
Ganot startup Rachip total staff people Haredi woman
According strict belief office remains woman one side men
In basic course woman learn programming father said
Ganot recall
I one first people class computer
Soon Ganot expanded education went work Israeli company
She Haredi woman
Realizing real opportunity eventually decided start company
It began one room employee
Now successful business belt mentoring community best brightest entrepreneur
We making wave say smile
Despite bold entrepreneurship big vision Crombie Ganot insist trying change community rather provide better opportunity way life continue
While minority group Israel resistant change fighting keep tradition alive duo say local rabbi nothing supportive endeavor
I want child become rabbi Crombie say hopeful would devote life faith
But grin
Or maybe

March The Druckman Company When I come organization Agile Coach one common area frustration Scrum Sprint Planning Meeting
These meeting take forever client complain
An easy way make Sprint Planning meeting shorter effective regular use Product Backlog Grooming Sessions
Sometimes called StoryTime session purpose meeting make improvement Product Backlog
That definition deliberately vague meeting quite versatile
A Backlog Grooming session used Write user story possible build Product Backlog scratch series one StoryTime session Break user story big epic Improve user story poorly written Estimate backlog item Add acceptance criterion Look deeper backlog technical planning That last bullet important one
Some people mistakenly believe Scrum mean never focusing anything coming next sprint
This true
Instead backlog grooming session great place Product Owner say The March release coming along great today I would like spend time looking user story I hope get July Doing give team opportunity look future product alert technical challenge gotcha
How hold effective Product Backlog grooming session
Here guideline session Product Owner come saying Here I would like accomplish This goal team point goal set meeting start
Wandering backlog grooming session saying Well want talk today guarantee time wasted
good backlog grooming session leaf everyone involved feeling familiar product backlog give clear understanding goal next sprint mean hit ground running Sprint Planning meeting
So schedule backlog grooming session precede next Sprint Planning least couple day
known chicken Scrum stakeholder effective participant backlog grooming session
But limit number
If example stakeholder want gather feedback get series meeting one big one
Remember stakeholder often understand rule Scrum well team Product Owner ScrumMaster
They often good Scrum manner may find large group quickly take meeting making chaotic le effective
Making regular use backlog grooming session one best way ensure Sprint Planning meeting run smoothly
They improve quality product backlog give everyone involved familiarity asked make easier reach Sprint Commitment confidence

The began long modern discipline emerged century hinted century prior
The progression mechanical invention theory towards led major academic field basis massive worldwide industry
The earliest known tool use computation developed period BCE
The Sumerians abacus consisted table successive column delimited successive order magnitude number system
Its original style usage line drawn sand pebble
Abaci modern design still used calculation tool today
In BC invented
It first known mechanism use later used
The also invented sophisticated abacus around century BC known
In century BC formulated rule known highly systematized technical
Panini used metarule
The believed early mechanical analog computer
It designed calculate astronomical position
It discovered wreck Greek island Antikythera Kythera dated BC
Mechanical analog computer device appeared thousand year later developed mechanical geared
According also made important advance development
machine also invented automatic player brother programmable considered first analog computer
Technological artifact similar complexity appeared century mechanical
When discovered logarithm computational purpose early century followed period considerable progress inventor scientist making calculating tool
In designed calculating machine abandoned project prototype started building destroyed fire
Around leading French mathematician constructed mechanical adding device based design described mathematician
Then invented completed
In first described accepted first design modern computer
The analytical engine expandable memory arithmetic unit logic processing capability able interpret programming language loop conditional branching
Although never built design studied extensively understood
The analytical engine would memory capacity le kilobyte memory clock speed le Hertz
Considerable advancement mathematics electronics theory required first modern computer could designed
In developed formal mathematical sense writing binary numeral system
In system one zero also represent value state
But took century published complete system allowed computational process mathematically modeled
By time first mechanical device driven binary pattern invented
The driven forward mechanization many task included
controlled loom hole punched card indicated binary unpunched spot indicated binary
Jacquard loom far computer illustrate machine could driven binary system
Before sometimes human clerk performed computation
They usually lead physicist
Many thousand computer employed commerce government research establishment
Most computer woman
Some performed astronomical calculation calendar others ballistic table military
After expression referred machine performed work human computer especially accordance effective method
The thesis state mathematical method effective could set list instruction able followed human clerk paper pencil long necessary without ingenuity insight
Machines computed continuous value became known kind
They used machinery represented continuous numeric quantity like angle shaft rotation difference electrical potential
Digital machinery contrast analog able render state numeric value store individual digit
Digital machinery used difference engine relay invention faster memory device
The phrase gradually gave way late onset electronic digital machinery became common
These computer able perform calculation performed previous human clerk
Since value stored digital machine bound physical property like analog device logical computer based digital equipment able anything could described purely mechanical
The theoretical created hypothetical device theorized order study property hardware
often regarded one first pioneer computing
Beginning Babbage vision mechanically computing number table
Putting reality Babbage designed calculator compute number decimal point long
Continuing success idea Babbage worked develop machine could compute number decimal place
By Babbage devised plan develop machine could use punched card perform arithmetical operation
The machine would store number memory unit would form sequential control
This mean one operation would carried another way machine would produce answer fail
This machine known Analytical Engine first true representation modern computer
Augusta Ada Byron credited pioneer computer programming regarded mathematical genius result mathematically heavy tutoring regimen mother assigned young girl
Lovelace began working Charles Babbage assistant Babbage working Analytical Engine first mechanical computer
During work Babbage Ada Lovelace became designer first computer algorithm ability compute
Moreover Lovelace work Babbage resulted prediction future computer perform mathematical calculation also manipulate symbol mathematical
While never able see result work Analytical Engine created lifetime effort later year beginning go unnoticed
The mathematical foundation modern computer science began laid
In theorem showed limit could proved disproved within
This led work Gödel others define describe formal system including concept
In Alan Turing independently also together introduced formalization limit computed purely mechanical model computing
This became hypothesis nature mechanical calculation device electronic computer
The thesis claim calculation possible performed algorithm running computer provided sufficient time storage space available
In also published seminal work abstract digital computing machine simply referred
This machine invented principle modern computer birthplace concept almost modern day computer use
These hypothetical machine designed formally determine mathematically computed taking account limitation computing ability
If Turing machine complete task considered Turing computable commonly Turing complete
The physicist described view fundamental importance Turing paper letter I know von Neumann well aware fundamental importance Turing paper Von Neumann introduced paper urging I studied care
Many people acclaimed von Neumann father computer modern sense term I sure would never made mistake
He might well called midwife perhaps firmly emphasized others I sure fundamental conception owing Turing Up electrical engineer able build electronic circuit solve mathematical logic problem manner lacking theoretical rigor
This changed engineer Akira Nakashima
From Nakashima published series paper showing discovered independently unaware work describe operation switching circuit
This concept utilizing property electrical switch logic basic concept underlies electronic
Switching circuit theory provided mathematical foundation tool design almost area modern technology
Nakashima work later cited elaborated seminal master thesis
While taking undergraduate philosophy class Shannon exposed work recognized could used arrange electromechanical relay used telephone routing switch solve logic problem
His thesis became foundation practical digital circuit design became widely known among electrical engineering community World War II
In developed world first functional computer
In shown principle
Zuse also developed computing machine considered first computer
He founded one earliest computer business producing became world first commercial computer
In designed first
In completed world first general purpose electronic digital computer also ran stored program like almost modern computer
The influence Turing seminal paper contribution project crucial successful development
In Britain completed small scale programmable computer based Turing philosophy
With operating speed MHz Pilot Model ACE time fastest computer world
Turing design much common today architecture called memory roughly capacity early computer enormous standard day
Had Turing ACE built planned full would different league early computer
went found field paper titled applied problem best encode information sender want transmit
This work one theoretical foundation many area study including
From experiment system interpreted radar image detect enemy plane coined term Greek word steersman
He published Cybernetics influenced
Wiener also compared computing machinery device cognitive similarity analysis brain wave
The first actual computer bug
It stuck relay Harvard Mark II
While invention term often erroneously attributed future rear admiral Navy supposedly logged bug September account conflict least detail
According account actual date September operator filed along insect notation First actual case bug found see detail
In model computer architecture introduced became known
Since von Neumann model provided uniformity subsequent computer design
The von Neumann architecture considered innovative introduced idea allowing machine instruction data share memory space
The von Neumann model composed three major part arithmetic logic unit ALU memory instruction processing unit IPU
In von Neumann machine design IPU pass address memory memory turn routed either back IPU instruction fetched ALU data fetched
Von Neumann machine design us RISC Reduced instruction set computing architecture mean instruction set us total instruction perform task
This contrast CISC instruction set instruction choose
With von Neumann architecture main memory along accumulator register hold result logical operation two memory addressed
Operations carried simple arithmetic performed ALU include addition subtraction multiplication division conditional branch commonly seen statement loop
The branch serve statement logical move different component machine move accumulator memory vice versa
Von Neumann architecture accepts fraction instruction data type
Finally von Neumann architecture simple one register management also simple
The architecture us set seven register manipulate interpret fetched data instruction
These register include IR instruction register IBR instruction buffer register MQ multiplier quotient register MAR memory address register MDR memory data register
The architecture also us program counter PC keep track program machine

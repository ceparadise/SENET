In order build high security web application essential conduct security analysis system
This involves identification potential threat analysis come appropriate response ensuring security system
This process known threat modelling
Threat modelling allows identifying rating threat involves addressing top threat Meier et al modelling involves understanding system identifying threat irrespective whether exploitable security requirement process Myagmar et al
While suggest identifying security requirement enable better focus conducting threat modelling Oladimeji et al
Myagmar et al suggest conducting threat modelling deriving security requirement instead relying standard security requirement thereby creating security requirement specific system
However Gandotra et al advise It important systematic threat modeling process ensure many possible threat vulnerability discovered developer attacker
The nature subject research demand following latter approach since research seek understand current issue threat coming security requirement solution overcome threat
In order conduct threat modelling arrive solution security system engineering method proposed Myagmar et al used
According three phase system security engineering Conducting threat modelling Derive security requirement Propose solution This method depicted figure Figure System Security Engineering The three phase explained brief following sub section
Phase Threat Modeling The approach threat modeling suggested Myagmar et al Meier et al Oladimeji et al Wernli studied none could directly applied social network application directly
Now social networking Web site involved accepting credit debit card buy gift online Lee Fung
Therefore adopt threat model indirectly based approach best fit requirement Identify component This involves identifying various component required utilize social networking functionality
Create architecture overview This step involves creating model architecture social networking application
Identify threat This step involves identifying threat component derived step
This requires understanding possible attack strategy component
The attack strategy utilize attack tree method
Attack tree method provide visual representation analyzing security system Myagmar et al
This approach allowing systematic analysis security system
By adding cost complexity overall cost securing system arrived
Attack tree analysis begin goal attack top
This goal branched represent various event leading main goal
The AND OR relationship indicate dependency independency Oladimeji et al
Analysis attack tree would also lead identification asset critical security perspective
Categorize threat The identified threat categorized based STRIDE CIA system Myagmar et al Torr Wernli
The two system explained brief table
Table Threat Categorization STRIDE Table Threat Categorization CIA For purpose thesis since discussion based security authentication credential STRIDE seems obvious option CIA
Rate threat This step involves prioritizing threat based rank assigned thereby helping understanding one need addressed high priority
The rating also provides idea regarding probability threat occurring possible impact occurs
This step help identify threat may require action except educating user others may require technical solution may warrant immediate attention
The DREAD methodology Damage potential Reproducibility Exploitability Affected Users Discoverability used evaluate risk rate threat Oladimeji et al Wernli
The rating table provided Meier et al utilized ranking threat
Table DREAD Method Meier et al Threat modeling detail discussed Chapter
Phase Security Requirements The threat model prepared first phase help derive security requirement social networking system
If security requirement well defined fault application considered secure Myagmar et al
The security requirement social networking system discussed Chapter
Phase Propose Solution Based threat modeling security requirement derived authentication system top US social networking site analyzed
This help understand weakness strength authentication mechanism system
Based understanding solution proposed overcomes weakness site retaining strength
The proposed solution discussed detail Chapter
Threat Modeling Identify component For using social networking system three category component involved The terminal This would utilizes social networking application either desktop laptop mobile phone
Server This terminal accepts user query responds
Communication channel This medium used transmission data
internet
Create architecture overview The architecture overview modeled based component identified section
For authentication social networking site use terminal communicate server communication channel
The server communicates identify authenticate user
In case authentication additional communication channel GSM case SMS landline case voice call
authentication password generator also depicted model
Figure Social Networking System Model Attack Strategies In order identify rate threat essential understand various attack strategy possible
Based threat identified threat profile created
Attack Strategies Terminal The target case terminal password generated

Social Engineering Attack Social engineering attack involve using technical strategy dig information
This requires suspect anything fishy therefore readily give away authentication credential
Several method employed order perform social engineering attack
These method broadly categorized technical method
The technical method mainly involves phishing method involve call mail user
Phishing Phishing involves combination social engineering attack spoofing technique thereby tricking user divulging confidential information including authentication credential attacker requires impersonate user Engin Kruegel
Phishing attack divided two type spoofing email website
Pharming explained detail section
Spoofing email old type attack wherein flaw SMTP protocol utilized order fake email address email originating FROM email header Ollman
The attacker sends spoofed email persuade user divulge confidential information
With increasing user awareness type attack however success rate reduced
This led modification attack instead asking confidential information email request follow link basically spoof organizational web site
The spoof web site appears like actual web site appears legitimate possible make difficult user suspect
The main reason success kind phishing user rely content web site instead URL determine legitimacy Dhamija et al
Phishing also carried using malwares Trojans
These delivered via email web site instant messaging program etc
Emails used send malicious content may present web site
Instant messaging program also used send malicious content spoof web site link etc
URL Obfuscation Phishing attack involve tricking user follow link spoof web site
Even though attempt social network web site increase user awareness checking URL providing authentication credential many study indicate user still check URL web site Florencio et al
URL obfuscated several method explained Fake Domain Names Attackers intentionally utilize domain name similar organization genuine web site domain name
URL Login This old trick longer supported web browser
It involved using URL format http password
Host Name Obfuscation This involves using IP address instead domain name thereby tricking user
Vishing This involves calling user impersonating employee agent target organization attempt acquire information
Emails may also sent call certain number used attacker obtain confidential information

Special Knowledge Attack This involves taking advantage fact user might stored authentication credential
Social networking site may always allow choice user name user might end user name easy remember
Also many user name password remember unlikely user prefer write
Users either write paper file stored computer may even use web browser feature store password
Shoulder Surfing An attacker observe user providing authentication credential figure
This type attack target particular user conducted large scale
While may problem user typically visit web site home use cyber cafe computer public area susceptible attack
Cameras may also used purpose
Simple Brute Force Attacks Like shoulder surfing simple brute force attack also usually target particular user
In simple brute force attack attacker continually try different permutation authentication credential order obtain access account
This type attack work especially well password also attacker know user personally
However simple brute force attack easier detect usual strategy social networking website lock block account usually unsuccessful attempt login Florencio et al

Identity Theft Impersonation In section example two victim impersonation provided
Attackers pretended victim created user account victim name obtaining access social network harming misusing account
Schneier wrote article explains one could easily create fake account social networking site
Attack Strategies Terminal Authentication credential also obtained user terminal desktop laptop mobile phone
There many way achieving By compromising user terminal By stealing terminal By obtaining physical access terminal By exploiting vulnerability web browser
Snooping using Malwares Snooping stealing user confidential information
Malwares malicious software get installed user terminal social engineering attack
without knowledge user harm could
Malwares allow attacker monitor action terminal thereby enabling take advantage
Viruses Trojan horse spyware example malwares
Malware creation grown staggering since Milletary
Malwares easily reconfigured target multiple site changing adding new site required
Presently according report Sophos increase rate malware spam attack currently stand user social networking website like facebook twitter
Malwares following type type electronic surveillance software capable capturing recording keystroke mouse click made user
These keystroke mouse click communicated attacker malware
These software
Hardware also available limited usage since requires physical access user PC
This method work well public computer cyber cafe example
Use virtual keyboard prevents type attack
Screen logger Screen logger also type electronic surveillance software
These software search terminal sensitive information
This includes registry feature web browser etc
With screen logger attacker took image screen break second level well
Trojan Horses The strongest type malware attack carried using Trojans
Trojans perform host attack already discussed like snooping using key logging screen logging attack communication channel network sniffing MITM attack etc
see section detail
User awareness regarding phishing technique led attacker looking alternate method Trojan seems answer need
It worth noting virus Trojans malwares virus Trojans Milletary

Token Theft Tokens usually small hardware device easily lost stolen
These could misused
If authentication based token alone becomes easier attacker
However even authentication provides attacker one factor authentication factor password identified using type attack discussed earlier
Attack Tree Terminal The attack tree terminal therefore derived Figure Attack Tree Terminal Attack Strategies Communication Channel The communication channel usually internet used transmitting data user terminal social networking server vice versa
The attack strategy include redirecting traffic sniffing hijacking session attack

Traffic Redirection One attack strategy communication channel redirect traffic
This achieved redirecting traffic fraudulent web site creating rogue DHCP server wireless access point
These explained brief Pharming Pharming attack redirects traffic fraudulent website
In case pharming would mean theft authentication credential user redirection fraudulent web site
This easily achieved changing host file user terminal
It also achieved exploiting weakness DNS server software
DNS poisoning one method whereby authentic URL resolved IP address lead fraudulent web site Ollman
Rogue DHCP Server A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP server networking protocol utilized retrieving information like IP address assigned machine networking related configuration information
If rogue DHCP server set attacker send fraudulent network information
This enable redirection traffic
Rogue Wireless Access Point With free wireless access available public location cafés airport also become favorite target attacker
An attacker set rogue wireless access point accessed user would continue working normally providing attacker access information including authentication credential

MITM Attacks This attacker becomes medium user server user try log social networking site actually connects user attacker server turn connects social networking site
Since information passing social networking server via attacker server attacker able save confidential information including authentication credential server
This type attack also enables attacker modify information receives user machine sending across social networking server
Since user able access service perform transaction normally use remains unaware MITM attack Milletary

Session Hijack Session hijacking involves exploiting session key usually used managing user information web application
This implemented generally using cooky easily stolen user computer attacker using MITM attack example

Network Sniffing Network sniffing work quite similar MITM attack except attacker middle rather disguise server user vice versa
Attack Tree Communication Channel The attack tree communication channel social networking site therefore derived Figure Attack Tree Communication Channel Attack Strategies Social Networking Server Bulk Guessing Attack Bulk guessing attack explained nicely Florencio et al simple example
Assume social networking web site million user
If social networking web site allows password digit would mean average considering possible combination password based digit password used ten different user
Based information attacker could use brute force attack guess user name given password
Unlike brute force attack would require multiple logins particular user name method would require one login attempt per user
It noteworthy however million attempt would required get successful logins Florencio et al
The success rate attack reduced using longer password combination alphabet number symbol make guess work difficult
Social Networking Policy Violation All social networking web site policy protect privacy user
According policy system administrator employee allowed access user information strictly business purpose
Employees access sensitive information intentionally leak accidentally expose user account
This usually occur social networking system poor access control adopted poor authentication methodology
Attack Tree Social Networking Server The attack tree communication channel social networking site therefore derived Figure Attack Tree Social Networking Server Attack Tree Social Networking System The figure show attack tree social networking system
Unlike bank objective attacker get financial gain attacker social networking system could many
The common goal obtain credential used obtain sensitive information user obtain financial gain defame organization work stalk harass user etc
Hence attack tree start common goal obtaining credential represented diamond
This broken component attacker could target achieve goal
The component represented rectangular box
Next within component hexagonal box used show possible way attacking component broken attack strategy represented hexagonal box
Attack vector could lead achievement attack strategy represented using circle
Attack vector may need combined attack vector AND OR relationship order achieve attack strategy Oladimeji et al
Figure Attack Tree Social Networking System Identify Threats The attack tree help u identify threat social networking system term authentication
From attack tree concluded authentication credential obtained phishing URL obfuscation fake web site spoofed email stealing credential paper using brute force shoulder surfing impersonating snooping malware obtaining physical access terminal token malware network sniffing redirecting transaction traffic malwares modifying transaction MITM hijacking session modifying traffic pharming bulk guessing attack policy violation Identify Assets The attack tree analysis helped identifying asset critical security social networking system

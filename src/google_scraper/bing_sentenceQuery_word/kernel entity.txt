A central part
It manages operation computer notably memory time
There two type kernel A computer user never interacts directly kernel
It run behind scene seen except text log print
The kernel fundamental part operating system
It thought program control program computer
When computer start go initialization function checking memory
It responsible assigning unassigning memory space allows software run
It provides service program request use disk piece hardware kernel forward request special program called control hardware manages set interrupt enable
Many kernel also responsible ensuring faulty program interfere operation others denying access memory allocated restricting amount CPU time consume
commonly use monolithic kernel
In example often made part kernel specifically Loadable Kernel Modules
When device needed extension loaded onto kernel word making kernel larger
Monolithic kernel make trouble one driver faulty graphic driver downloaded
Because part kernel often override mechanism deal faulty program see
This mean kernel thus entire computer cease function
If many device kernel also run memory causing system crash making computer slow
Microkernels way solving problem
In microkernel operating system kernel deal critical activity controlling memory CPU nothing else
Drivers function monolithic kernel would normally within kernel moved outside kernel control
Instead uncontrollable part kernel beta driver therefore unlikely cause crash beta web browser driver go wrong simply restarted kernel
Unfortunately creating microkernel based operating system difficult operating system like commonly used
microkernel operating system

The core computer complete control everything system
On system one first program loaded
It handle rest well request translating instruction
It handle memory like keyboard monitor printer speaker
The critical code kernel usually loaded protected area memory prevents overwritten minor part operating system
The kernel performs task running process handling interrupt
In contrast everything user writing text text editor running program etc
This separation prevents user data kernel data interfering causing instability slowness
The kernel
When make request kernel called
Kernel design differ manage system call
A run operating system speed
A run process user space
The kernel primary function mediate access computer resource including Key aspect necessary resource management definition execution domain protection mechanism used mediate access resource within domain
Kernels also usually provide method communication process called IPC
A kernel may implement feature rely process run provide facility process although case must provide mean IPC allow process access facility provided
Finally kernel must provide running program method make request access facility
The kernel full access system memory must allow process safely access memory require
Often first step usually achieved
Virtual addressing allows kernel make given physical address appear another address virtual address
Virtual address space may different different process memory one process access particular virtual address may different memory another process access address
This allows every program behave one apart kernel running thus prevents application crashing
On many system program virtual address may refer data currently memory
The layer indirection provided virtual addressing allows operating system use data store like store would otherwise remain main memory
As result operating system allow program use memory system physically available
When program need data currently RAM CPU signal kernel happened kernel responds writing content inactive memory block disk necessary replacing data requested program
The program resumed point stopped
This scheme generally known
Virtual addressing also allows creation virtual partition memory two disjointed area one reserved kernel application
The application permitted processor address kernel memory thus preventing application damaging running kernel
This fundamental partition memory space contributed much current design actual kernel almost universal system although research kernel
take approach
To perform useful function process need access connected computer controlled kernel
A device driver computer program enables operating system interact hardware device
It provides operating system information control communicate certain piece hardware
The driver important vital piece program application
The design goal driver abstraction function driver translate function call programming call call
In theory device work correctly suitable driver
Device driver used thing video card sound card printer scanner modem LAN card
The common level abstraction device driver
On hardware side
On software side For example show user something screen application would make request kernel would forward request display driver responsible actually plotting
A kernel must maintain list available device
This list may known advance
embedded system kernel rewritten available hardware change configured user typical older PCs system designed personal use detected operating system run time normally called
In plug play system device manager first performs scan different PCI USB detect installed device search appropriate driver
As device management topic driver handled differently kind kernel design every case kernel provide allow driver physically access device memory location
Very important decision made designing device management system design access may involve making operation easily causing significant performance overhead
In computing system call process request service operating system kernel normally permission run
System call provide interface process operating system
Most operation interacting system require permission available user level process
performed device present system form communication process requires use system call
A system call mechanism used application program request service operating system
They use instruction cause processor change mode
An example would supervisor mode protected mode
This operating system performs action like accessing hardware device memory management unit
Generally operating system provides library sits operating system normal program
Usually C library Glibc Windows API
The library handle detail passing information kernel switching supervisor mode
System call include close open read wait write
To actually perform useful work process must able access service provided kernel
This implemented differently kernel provide turn invokes related kernel function
The method invoking kernel function varies kernel kernel
If memory isolation use impossible user process call kernel directly would violation processor access control rule
A possibility An important consideration design kernel support provides protection fault malicious behaviour
These two aspect usually clearly distinguished kernel design lead rejection
The mechanism policy provided kernel classified according several criterion including static enforced dynamic enforced according protection principle satisfy
whether hardware supported language based whether open mechanism binding policy many
Support hierarchical protection domain typically implemented using
Many kernel provide implementation capability
object provided user code allow limited access underlying object managed kernel
A common example occurs file handling file representation information stored permanent storage device
The kernel may able perform many different operation
read write delete execute file content user level application may permitted perform operation
may allowed read file
A common implementation kernel provide object application typically called file handle application may invoke operation validity kernel check time operation requested
Such system may extended cover object kernel manages indeed object provided user application
An efficient simple way provide hardware support capability delegate responsibility checking every memory access mechanism called
Most commercial computer architecture lack MMU support capability
An alternative approach simulate capability using commonly supported hierarchical domain approach protected object must reside address space application access kernel also maintains list capability memory
When application need access object protected capability performs system call kernel check whether application capability grant permission perform requested action permitted performs access either directly delegating request another process
The performance cost address space switching limit practicality approach system complex interaction object used current operating system object accessed frequently expected perform quickly
Approaches protection mechanism firmware supported instead simulated higher level
simulating capability manipulating page table hardware direct support possible performance implication
Lack hardware support may issue however system choose use protection
An important kernel design decision choice abstraction level security mechanism policy implemented
Kernel security mechanism play critical role supporting security higher level
One approach use firmware kernel support fault tolerance see build security policy malicious behavior top adding feature mechanism necessary delegating responsibility
Approaches delegate enforcement security policy compiler application level often called
The lack many critical security mechanism current mainstream operating system impedes implementation adequate security policy application
In fact common misconception computer security security policy implemented application regardless kernel support
Typical computer system today use rule program allowed access data
The processor monitor execution stop program violates rule user process read write kernel memory
In system lack support capability process isolated using separate address space
Calls user process kernel regulated requiring use one system call method
An alternative approach use protection
In kernel allow code execute produced trusted language
The language may designed impossible programmer instruct something violate security requirement
Advantages approach include Disadvantages include Examples system protection include
proved logical point view unlock operation operating binary sufficient primitive express functionality process cooperation
However approach generally held lacking term safety efficiency whereas approach flexible
A number approach either available well many modern kernel providing support system
The idea kernel device handled uniformly process parallel process first proposed implemented although similar idea suggested
In Hansen description common process called device called
Similar physical memory allowing application direct access controller port register cause controller malfunction system crash
With depending complexity device device get surprisingly complex program use several different controller
Because providing abstract interface manage device important
This interface normally done Device Driver Hardware Abstraction Layer
Frequently application require access device
The Kernel must maintain list device querying system way
This done BIOS one various system bus USB
When application request operation device Such displaying character kernel need send request current active video driver
The video driver turn need carry request
This example Inter Process Communication IPC
Naturally listed task feature provided many way differ design implementation
The principle substantial difference philosophy micro monolithic kernel
Here support allows implementation many different policy policy particular mode operation
For instance mechanism may provide user attempt call authorization server determine whether access granted policy may authorization server request password check encrypted password stored database
Because mechanism generic policy could easily changed
requiring use mechanism policy integrated module
In minimal microkernel basic policy included mechanism allows running top kernel remaining part operating system application decide policy adopt memory management high level process scheduling file system management etc
A monolithic kernel instead tends include many policy therefore restricting rest system rely
presented argument favour separation mechanism policy
The failure properly fulfill separation one major cause lack substantial innovation existing operating system problem common computer architecture
The monolithic design induced kernel mode user mode architectural approach protection technically called common conventional commercial system fact every module needing protection therefore preferably included kernel
This link monolithic design privileged mode reconducted key issue separation fact privileged mode architectural approach melt together protection mechanism security policy major alternative architectural approach clearly distinguishes two leading naturally microkernel design see
While execute code address space try run service user space aiming improve maintainability modularity codebase
Most kernel fit exactly one category rather found two design
These called
More exotic design available seldom used production system
The hypervisor example exokernel
In monolithic kernel OS service run along main kernel thread thus also residing memory area
This approach provides rich powerful hardware access
Some developer developer maintain easier implement monolithic kernel microkernels
The main disadvantage monolithic kernel dependency system component bug device driver might crash entire system fact large kernel become difficult maintain
Monolithic kernel traditionally used operating system contain operating system core function device driver
This traditional design UNIX system
A monolithic kernel one single program contains code necessary perform every kernel related task
Every part accessed program put library kernel space Device driver Scheduler Memory handling File system Network stack
Many system call provided application allow access service
A monolithic kernel initially loaded subsystem may needed tuned point fast faster one specifically designed hardware although relevant general sense
Modern monolithic kernel fall category operating system feature ability load module runtime thereby allowing easy extension kernel capability required helping minimize amount code running kernel space
In monolithic kernel advantage hinge point Most work monolithic kernel done via system call
These interface usually kept tabular structure access subsystem within kernel disk operation
Essentially call made within program checked copy request passed system call
Hence far travel
The monolithic Linux kernel made extremely small ability dynamically load module also ease customization
In fact version small enough fit together large number utility program single floppy disk still provide fully functional operating system one popular
This ability miniaturize kernel also led rapid growth use Linux
These type kernel consist core function operating system device driver ability load module runtime
They provide rich powerful abstraction underlying hardware
They provide small set simple hardware abstraction use application called server provide functionality
This particular approach defines virtual interface hardware set system call implement operating system service process management concurrency memory management several module run supervisor mode
This design several flaw limitation Microkernel also abbreviated μK uK term describing approach operating system design functionality system moved traditional kernel set server communicate minimal kernel leaving little possible system space much possible user space
A microkernel designed specific platform device ever going need operate
The microkernel approach consists defining simple abstraction hardware set primitive implement minimal OS service
Other service including normally provided kernel implemented program referred
Microkernels easier maintain monolithic kernel large number system call might slow system typically generate overhead plain function call
Only part really require privileged mode kernel space IPC Communication basic scheduler scheduling primitive basic memory handling basic primitive
Many critical part running user space The complete scheduler memory handling file system network stack
Micro kernel invented reaction traditional monolithic kernel design whereby system functionality put one static program running special system mode processor
In microkernel fundamental task performed able access necessarily hardware manage memory coordinate message passing process
Some system use micro kernel QNX HURD
In case user session entire snapshot system view referred
The essence microkernel architecture illustrates advantage Most micro kernel use message passing system sort handle request one server another
The message passing system generally operates port basis microkernel
As example request memory sent port opened microkernel request sent
Once within microkernel step similar system call
The rationale would bring modularity system architecture would entail cleaner system easier debug dynamically modify customizable user need performing
They part operating system like AIX BeOS Hurd Mach macOS MINIX
Etc
Although micro kernel small combination required auxiliary code fact often larger monolithic kernel
Advocates monolithic kernel also point structure microkernel system operating system interact directly hardware creates cost term system efficiency
These type kernel normally provide minimal service defining memory address space communication IPC process management
The function running hardware process handled directly micro kernel
Proponents micro kernel point monolithic kernel disadvantage error kernel cause entire system crash
However microkernel kernel process crash still possible prevent crash system whole merely restarting service caused error
Other service provided kernel networking implemented program referred
Servers allow operating system modified simply starting stopping program
For machine without networking support instance networking server started
The task moving kernel move data various application server creates overhead detrimental efficiency micro kernel comparison monolithic kernel
Disadvantages microkernel exist however
Some The disadvantage micro kernel extremely context based
As example work well small single purpose critical system many process need run complication process management effectively mitigated
A microkernel allows implementation remaining part operating system normal application program written use different operating system top unchanged kernel
It also possible dynamically switch among operating system one active simultaneously
As computer kernel grows grows size vulnerability besides reducing security problem enlarging
This mitigated degree perfecting system virtual memory support
To reduce kernel footprint extensive editing performed carefully remove unneeded code difficult interdependency part kernel million line code
By early due various shortcoming monolithic kernel versus microkernels monolithic kernel considered obsolete virtually operating system researcher
As result design monolithic kernel rather microkernel topic famous debate
There merit side argument presented
designed code address space developer argue necessary increase performance system
Some developer also maintain monolithic system extremely efficient well written
The monolithic model tends efficient use shared kernel memory rather slower IPC system microkernel design typically based
The performance microkernels poor early
However study empirically measured performance microkernels analyze reason inefficiency
The explanation data left folklore assumption due increased frequency switch increased frequency increased frequency
In fact guessed reason poor performance microkernels might well actual inefficiency whole microkernel particular implemented microkernels particular concept
Therefore remained studied solution build efficient microkernel unlike previous attempt apply correct construction technique
On end architecture lead design monolithic kernel significant performance drawback time interaction different level protection
process manipulate data structure mode mode since requires message copying
By researcher abandoned belief careful tuning could reduce overhead dramatically recently newer microkernels optimized performance addressed problem
Hybrid kernel used commercial operating system NT NT NT NT XP Vista
us hybrid kernel called based upon code OSFMK
They similar micro kernel except include additional code increase performance
These kernel represent compromise implemented developer demonstrated pure micro kernel provide high performance
These type kernel extension micro kernel property monolithic kernel
Unlike monolithic kernel type kernel unable load module runtime
Hybrid kernel micro kernel code order code run quickly would
Hybrid kernel compromise monolithic microkernel design
This implies running service kernel space reduce performance overhead traditional microkernel still running kernel code device driver server user space
Many traditionally monolithic kernel least adding actively exploiting module capability
The well known kernel Linux kernel
The modular kernel essentially part built core kernel binary binary load memory demand
It important note code tainted module potential destabilize running kernel
Many people become confused point discussing micro kernel
It possible write driver microkernel completely separate memory space test going live
When kernel module loaded access monolithic portion memory space adding need therefore opening doorway possible pollution
A advantage modular Hybrid kernel Modules generally communicate kernel using module interface sort
The interface generalized although particular given operating system always possible use module
Often device driver may need flexibility module interface affords
Essentially two system call often safety check done monolithic kernel may done twice
Some disadvantage modular approach A nanokernel delegate virtually service including even basic one like make kernel memory requirement even smaller traditional microkernel
Exokernels approach operating system design
They differ type kernel functionality limited protection multiplexing raw hardware providing hardware abstraction top develop application
This separation hardware protection hardware management enables application developer determine make efficient use available hardware specific program
Exokernels extremely small
However accompanied library operating system see also providing application developer functionality conventional operating system
A major advantage system incorporate multiple library operating system exporting different example one high level development one control
Strictly speaking operating system thus kernel run computer
Programs directly loaded executed bare metal machine provided author program willing work without hardware abstraction operating system support
Most early computer operated way early reset reloaded execution different program
Eventually small ancillary program left memory run loaded
As developed formed basis became early operating system kernel
The approach still used today general newer computer use modern operating system kernel
In introduced system design philosophy small nucleus upon operating system different purpose could built orderly manner would called microkernel approach
In decade preceding computer grown enormously power point computer operator looking new way get people use spare time machine
One major development era whereby number user would get small slice computer time rate appeared connected slower machine
The development system led number problem
One user particularly university system developed seemed want system get time
For reason became major focus project
Another ongoing issue properly handling computing resource user spent time staring terminal thinking input instead actually using resource computer system give CPU time active user period
Finally system typically offered several layer deep partitioning expensive resource led major development system
The released among first certainly successful home computer feature advanced kernel architecture
The AmigaOS kernel executive component us microkernel design kernel component like direct access hardware
There memory protection kernel almost always running user mode
Only special action executed kernel mode application ask operating system execute code kernel mode
During design phase programmer decided model every believed purpose
For instance represented file known location data copied file printed
Other system provide similar functionality tended virtualize device lower level device file would instance concept
system file level allowed user manipulate entire system using existing utility concept dramatically simplifying operation
As extension paradigm Unix allows programmer manipulate file using series small program using concept allowed user complete operation stage feeding file chain tool
Although end result using smaller program way dramatically increased flexibility well ease development use allowing user modify workflow adding removing program chain
In Unix model consists two part first huge collection utility program drive operation kernel run program
Under Unix programming standpoint distinction two fairly thin kernel program running supervisor mode act program loader supervisor small utility program making rest system provide service program beyond kernel intervene
Over year computing model changed Unix treatment byte stream longer universally applicable
Although could treated file byte stream printed read seem true
posed another problem
Even network communication compared file access architecture dealt discrete chunk data whole file
As capability computer grew Unix became increasingly cluttered code
It also modularity Unix kernel extensively scalable
While kernel might seventy eighty kernel modern Unix successor like million line
Modern generally based monolithic kernel
Examples many well variant kernel
Apart alternative amateur developer maintain active populated hobby kernel mostly end sharing many feature Linux FreeBSD DragonflyBSD OpenBSD NetBSD kernel compatible

Apple moved nanokernel design Mac OS
Against modern originally named Mac OS X based us hybrid kernel called created combining kernel

Because dependence another operating system initial release Windows prior Windows considered confused
This product line continued evolve series adding addressing multitasking ended release
Microsoft also developed operating system similar interface intended business user
This line started release introduced general user release October completely different much sophisticated operating system
This line continues
The kernel considered hybrid kernel kernel contains task Window Manager IPC Managers layered subsystem model
supervisory program supervisor usually part control execution regulates operation similar function regulates flow work system
Historically term essentially associated line operating system starting
In operating system supervisor generally called kernel
In IBM abstracted supervisor hardware resulting enabled
capacity run multiple operating system machine totally independently
Hence first system called
Although developed microkernel microkernels developed specific aim
The mainly kernel created demonstrate microkernels necessarily slow
Newer implementation able run next process separate address space

An kernel plus application enable user get something done compiler text editor window manager etc
It seems original metaphor got u word kernel first place forgotten
The metaphor operating system seed
The kernel seed core operating system providing operating system service application program surrounded shell seed user see outside
Some people want tie kernel indeed shell specific
But truth lot variation across operating system
Not least variation constitutes shell range Solaris Netware Console Command Interpreter Workplace Shell Windows NT Explorer also lot variance one operating system another part kernel may may include disk example
It best remember
Well difference kernel OS
Kernel described heart OS manages core feature OS useful application utility added kernel complete package becomes OS
So easily said operating system consists kernel space user space
So say Linux kernel include application like utility windowing system graphical desktop system administrator command text editor compiler etc

In computing central component computer operating system bridge application actual data processing done hardware level
The kernel responsibility include managing system resource communication hardware software component
Usually basic component operating system kernel provide abstraction layer resource especially processor device application software must control perform function
It typically make facility available application process communication mechanism system call
Kernel resides memory space specially provided handling o even say OS handle Resources system Kernel one heart o maintain manage track o
The kernel might operating system might part operating system
In Linux kernel loaded executed first
Then start bit OS like init make system useful
This especially true environment
The kernel minimal functionality

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

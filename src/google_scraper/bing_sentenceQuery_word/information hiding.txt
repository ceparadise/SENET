In principle segregation likely change thus protecting part program extensive modification design decision changed
The protection involves providing stable protects remainder program implementation detail likely change
Written another way information hiding ability prevent certain aspect accessible using either programming language feature like private variable explicit exporting policy
The term often used interchangeably information hiding
Not agree distinction two though one may think information hiding principle encapsulation technique
A software module hide information encapsulating information module construct present interface
A common use information hiding hide physical storage layout data changed change restricted small subset total program
For example point represented program three variable later representation changed single variable size three module designed information hiding mind would protect remainder program change
In information hiding way type reduces software development risk shifting code uncertain implementation design decision onto
Clients interface perform operation purely implementation change client change
In book defined encapsulation process compartmentalizing element abstraction constitute structure behavior encapsulation serf separate contractual interface abstraction implementation
The purpose achieve potential change internal mechanism component improved without impact component component replaced different one support public interface
Encapsulation also protects integrity component preventing user setting internal data component invalid inconsistent state
Another benefit encapsulation reduces system complexity thus increase robustness limiting interdependency software component
In sense idea encapsulation general applied OOP example relational database encapsulated sense public interface example hide internal machinery data structure database management system
As encapsulation core principle good software architecture every level granularity
Encapsulating software behind interface allows construction object mimic behavior interaction object real world
For example simple digital alarm clock object use understand
They understand alarm clock use provided interface button screen without understand every part inside clock
Similarly clock replaced different model lay person could continue use way provided interface work
In concrete setting programming language notion used mean either information hiding mechanism bundling mechanism combination two
See detail
The concept information hiding first described
Before modularity discussed Richard Gauthier Stephen Pont book although used many commercial site many year previously especially without acquiring hiding tag similar reason well obvious reason
Information hiding serf effective criterion dividing piece equipment software hardware module functionality
For instance car complex piece equipment
In order make design manufacturing maintenance car reasonable complex piece equipment divided particular interface hiding design decision
By designing car fashion car manufacturer also offer various option still vehicle economical manufacture
For instance car manufacturer may luxury version car well standard version
The luxury version come powerful engine standard version
The designing two different car engine one luxury version one standard version provide interface engine
Both engine fit engine bay car version
Both engine fit transmission engine mount control
The difference engine powerful luxury version larger displacement fuel injection system programmed provide fuel air mixture larger displacement engine requires
In addition powerful engine luxury version may also offer option better radio CD player comfortable seat better suspension system wider tire different paint color
With change car standard version luxury version
The radio CD player module replaces standard radio also module luxury model
The comfortable seat installed seat mount standard type seat
Whether seat leather plastic offer lumbar support matter
The engineer design car dividing task piece work assigned team
Each team design particular standard interface allows team flexibility design component time ensuring component fit together
Motor vehicle manufacturer frequently use core structure several different model part measure
Such also provides example information hiding since floorpan built without knowing whether used sedan hatchback
As seen example information hiding provides flexibility
This flexibility allows programmer modify functionality computer program normal evolution computer program changed better fit need user
When computer program well designed decomposing source code solution module using principle information hiding evolutionary change much easier change typically local rather global change
Cars provide another example interface driver
They present standard interface pedal wheel shifter signal gauge etc
people trained licensed
Thus people learn drive car need learn completely different way driving every time drive new model
Granted manual automatic transmission difference whole car maintain unified interface

different encapsulation information hiding
I see
Encapsulation information hiding much related concept information hiding achieved using Encapsulation
bleh bleh bleh l Great nice blog keep sharing good descriprtion abstration recpect two concept
Great Article This wonderful blog

What exactly difference Ecapsulation Information Hiding
Well know making field private making setter getter field encapsulation mean
suppose class described
Now class IsThisEncapsulation example Encapsulation
Now would making field class private achieve informaton hiding
Could please give clear example help distinguish concept clearly
Well I know making field private making setter getter field encapsulation
However encapsulation mean
Encapsulation OOP concept object state class field behaviour method wrapped together
Java provides encapsulation using
Information Hiding mechanism restricting access object component
Your example case Information Hiding make private
Initially Hiding considered part Encapsulation definition Encapsulation would second definition motivated fact many OOP language hiding component automatic overridden thus information hiding defined separate notion prefer second definition
Reference From Abstraction encapsulation complementary concept abstraction focus observable behavior object encapsulation focus upon implementation give rise behavior encapsulation often achieved information hiding process hiding secret object contribute essential characteristic
Its interface definition chosen reveal little possible inner working
Parnas Abstraction used technique identifying information hidden
Confusion occur people fail distinguish hiding information technique abstraction used help identify information hidden
It refers building capsule case conceptual barrier around collection thing
et al As process encapsulation mean act enclosing one item within container
Encapsulation entity refers package enclosure hold contains encloses one item
If encapsulation thing information hiding one might make argument encapsulated also hidden
This obviously true
There subtle difference I like description Growing Software Guided Tests book written Steve Freeman Nat Pryce Which say Ensures behavior object affected API
It let u control much change one object impact part system ensuring unexpected dependency unrelated component
Conceals object implement functionality behind abstraction API
It let u work higher abstraction ignoring detail unrelated task hand
Encapsulation information hiding closely linked concept though precise definition vary depending talk
The concept information hiding first described suggested access information restricted reduce interconnectedness system
He proposed would facilitate splitting system module maintaining external interface allowing implementation detail changed without affecting client
The term encapsulation coined describe use procedure control access underlying data order reduce system complexity protect data dangerous modification
Subsequently described information hiding encapsulation abstraction synonymous term describe hiding detail system likely change
However distinction drawn information hiding encapsulation described encapsulation strict enforcement information hiding
Some author describe encapsulation mechanism especially programming language allowing information hiding
suggests degree piece code encapsulated depends amount code would broken changed
In sense private data method encapsulated fewer method accessed
In contrast public data method completely unencapsulated amount code accessed unknown
Conversely suggests encapsulation simply language mechanism allows data bundled method operate data
He claim encapsulation fundamentally nothing information hiding
However definition counter almost usage term academic literature year prior publication article
There example usage example far particularly notable
In conclusion information hiding idea information hidden design changed without affecting client
This allows increased flexibility robustness
Encapsulation may considered information hiding term often used describe practical implementation information hiding especially programming
As example information consider class The implementation class completely unencapsulated mean inflexible
easily add support individual cent future unsafe
account changed negative
However hide data behind formally defined interface method gain flexibility safety
We control state modified also change implementation without breaking client code The class better encapsulated hidden information underlying implementation
see literal meaning
Encapsulation putting thing bag

putting attribute method class achieves Encapsulation However certain extent also achieve information hiding encapsulation
access modifier contribute encapsulation information hiding
To Answer question Information hiding Is hiding essential part object expose way implemented internally exposing higher abstraction
For
In TV remote exposed key interact TV aware go inside
Encapsulation Encapsulation combining data method allowing internal data accessed public method
So yes class make variable age private achieve encapsulation By posting answer agree

What mean
I want make sure I definition correct I sound like idiot conversing
In IDE correct I wrong machine code
You program basically stepping program looking error
But exactly program
In VS I aware build program produce executable file debug folder
Any tech definition mean program
This necessarily bear human mean far MSBuild concerned code describes thusly suggests mean roughly compile plus associated auxiliary event get code artifact deployable result
Building mean many thing many people
The build contain many thing The build done hand automated hybrid two
A manual build build requires build command like compiler executed one one
An automated build package together individual build tool large build program ideally run single step
It mean process converting source artifact artifact
Many project involve lot source file
In principle manually compile one file use compiler compile source file temporary object file containing machine code
In practice far tedious manually compile every source file one time even tedious manually keep track source file need recompiled
So build entire project running automated build program typically called make
That program go list source file often stored yet another source file named makefile call compiler one many version make smart enough recompile file changed need recompiled
While compiling arguably important part build process often build run lot program compiler
Occasionally complete build spend time running program running compiler
For example many people find convenient single button compile source code latest version also run standard series test
So makefile also list whatever command needed run test become part build process

I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

The term build may refer process source code converted form run computer form
One important step software build compilation process source code file converted executable code
The process building software usually managed build tool
Builds created certain point development reached code deemed ready implementation either testing outright release
A build also known software build code build
The term build slightly different meaning depending whether used noun verb
A developer might build mean run build process might also refer end result build number differentiate talking colleague
A build simple extremely complex
A single developer often build right desktop within integrated development environment large team generally professional nothing supervise build process
In latter case extensive build tool used also aid testing metric function
A build usually version software format used software development company
When build finished often stored single package marketed version number although often possible find build number dig deep enough
Ideally theory incremental later version build feature fewer bug although always work practice

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

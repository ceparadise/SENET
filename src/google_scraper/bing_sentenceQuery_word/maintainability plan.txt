Reliability availability maintainability RAM three system attribute tremendous interest system engineer logistician user
Collectively affect economic cost system utility
Reliability maintainability availability RAM three system attribute great interest system engineer logistician user
Collectively affect utility cost product system
The origin contemporary reliability engineering traced World War II
The discipline first concern electronic mechanical component Ebeling
However current trend point dramatic rise number industrial military consumer product integrated computing function Because rapidly increasing integration computer product system used consumer industry government military reliability must consider hardware software
Maintainability model present interesting challenge
The time repair item sum time required evacuation diagnosis assembly resource part bay tool mechanic repair inspection return
Administrative delay holiday also affect repair time
Often minimum time complete zero resulting distribution used model maintainability threshold parameter
A threshold parameter defined minimum probable time repair
Estimation maintainability complicated queuing effect resulting time repair independent
This dependency frequently make analytical solution problem involving maintainability intractable promotes use simulation support analysis
This section set forth basic definition briefly describes probability distribution discus role RAM engineering system development operation
The final subsection list common reliability test method span development operation
defined probability system system element performing intended function stated condition without failure given period time ASQ
A precise definition must include detailed description function environment time scale constitutes failure
Each surprisingly difficult define precisely one might wish
defined probability system system element repaired defined environment within specified period time
Increased maintainability implies shorter repair time ASQ
probability repairable system system element operational given point time given set environmental condition
Availability depends reliability maintainability discussed detail later topic ASQ
A failure event inoperable state item part item would perform specified GEIA
The failure mechanism physical chemical electrical thermal process result failure GEIA
In computerized system software defect fault cause failure Laprie failure may preceded error internal item
The failure mode way consequence mechanism item fails GEIA Laprie
The severity failure mode magnitude impact Laprie
Reliability thought probability survival component time Its complement probability failure time If define random variable T time te failure R reliability F failure probability The failure probability cumulative distribution function CDF mathematical probability distribution
Continuous distribution used purpose include exponential Weibull generalized gamma
Discrete distribution Bernoulli Binomial Poisson used calculating expected number failure single probability success The continuous distribution used reliability also used maintainability although interpretation different probability failed component restored service prior time
However prediction maintainability may account process administrative delay travel time sparing staffing therefore complex
The probability distribution used reliability maintainability estimation referred model provide estimate true failure restoration item evaluation
Ideally value parameter used model would estimated life testing operating experience
However performing test collecting credible operating data item fielded costly
Therefore approximation use data similar system engineering judgment method sometimes used
As result estimate based limited data may imprecise
Testing method gather data discussed
RAM inherent product system attribute considered throughout development lifecycle
Reliability standard textbook author others proposed multiple development process model O Connor Kapur Ebeling DoD
The discussion section relies standard developed joint effort Electronic Industry Association Government adopted Department Defense GEIA defines process understanding user requirement constraint design reliability production reliability monitoring operation use discussed next section
Understanding user requirement involves eliciting information functional requirement constraint mass power consumption spatial footprint life cycle cost need correspondent RAM requirement
From emerge system requirement include specification reliability maintainability availability conditioned projected operating environment
RAM requirement definition challenging essential development success definition general functional requirement
System design based user requirement system design alternative formulated
Reliability engineering phase seek increase system robustness measure redundancy diversity test advanced diagnostics modularity enable rapid physical replacement
In addition may possible reduce failure rate measure use higher strength material increasing quality component moderating extreme environmental condition shortened maintenance inspection overhaul interval
Design analysis may include mechanical stress corrosion radiation analysis mechanical component thermal analysis mechanical electrical component Electromagnetic Interference EMI analysis measurement electrical component subsystem
In computer based system hardware mean time failure hundred thousand hour system design measure increase system reliability focused software
The obvious way improve software reliability improving quality disciplined development effort test
Methods scope software engineering scope section
However reliability availability also increased architectural redundancy independence diversity
Redundancy must accompanied measure ensure data consistency managed failure detection switchover
Within software architecture measure watchdog timer flow control data integrity check hashing cyclic redundancy check input output validity checking retries restarts increase reliability failure detection coverage Shooman
System RAM characteristic continuously evaluated design progress
Where failure rate known often case unique custom developed component assembly software developmental testing may undertaken ass reliability component
Evaluations based quantitative analysis ass numerical reliability availability system usually based reliability block diagram fault tree Markov model Petri net O Connor
Markov model Petri net particular value system use redundancy
Evaluations based qualitative analysis ass vulnerability single point failure failure containment recovery maintainability
The primary qualitative method failure mode effect criticality analysis FMECA Kececioglu
The development program Discrepancy Reporting DR Failure Reporting Corrective Action System FRACAS also used identify failure mode may anticipated FMECA identify common problem corrected improved design development process
Analyses related discipline design time also affect RAM
Human factor analysis necessary ensure operator maintainer interact system manner minimizes failure restoration time occur
There also strong link RAM cybersecurity computer based system
On one hand defensive measure reduce frequency failure due malicious event
On device firewall policy enforcement device serf also known directory server also become single point failure performance bottleneck reduce system reliability availability
Many production issue associated RAM related quality
The important ensuring repeatability uniformity production process complete unambiguous specification item supply chain
Other related design manufacturability storage transportation Kapur Eberlin
Large software intensive system information system affected issue related configuration management integration testing installation testing
Testing recording failure problem reporting corrective action system PRACAS FRACAS capture data failure improvement correct failure
Depending organizational consideration may separate system used design
After system fielded reliability availability ass whether system product met RAM objective identify unexpected failure mode record fix ass utilization maintenance resource ass operating environment
The FRACAS maintenance management database may used purpose
In order ass RAM necessary maintain accurate record failure also operating time duration outage
Systems report repair action outage incident may sufficient purpose
An organization integrated data system allows reliability data considered logistical data part personnel tool bay transportation evacuation queue cost allowing total awareness interplay logistical RAM issue
These issue turn must integrated management operational system allow organization reap benefit occur complete situational awareness respect RAM
Reliability Testing performed component subsystem system level throughout product system lifecycle
Examples hardware related category reliability testing include Ebeling O Connor Examples system level testing including hardware software O Connor Ebeling Stability test Stability test life test integrated hardware software system
The goal testing determine integrated system failure rate ass operational suitability
Test condition must include accurate simulation operating environment including workload mean identifying recording failure
Because potential impact cost schedule reliability testing coordinated overall system engineering effort
Test planning consideration include number test unit duration test environmental condition mean detecting failure
True RAM model system generally never known
Data given system assumed collected used select distribution model used fit parameter distribution
This process differs significantly one usually taught introductory statistic course
First normal distribution seldom used life distribution since defined negative time
Second importantly reliability data different classic experimental data
Reliability data often censored biased observational missing information covariates environmental condition
Data testing often expensive resulting small sample size
These problem reliability data require sophisticated strategy process mitigate
One consequence issue estimate based limited data imprecise
In large program RAM expert report system engineering organization
At project product conception top level goal defined RAM based operational need lifecycle cost projection warranty cost estimate
These lead RAM derived requirement allocation approved managed system engineering requirement management function
RAM testing coordinated product system testing testing organization test failure evaluated RAM function joint meeting Failure Review Board
In case RAM function may recommend design development process change result evaluation test result software discrepancy report proposal must adjudicated system engineering organization case acquiring customer cost increase involved
Once system fielded reliability availability tracked
Doing allows producer owner verify design met RAM objective identify unexpected failure mode record fix ass utilization maintenance resource ass operating environment
One tracking system generically known FRACAS system Failure Reporting Corrective Action System
Such system capture data failure improvement correct failure
This database separate warranty data base typically run financial function organization track cost
A FRACAS organization system designed following system engineering principle
In particular FRACAS system support later analysis analysis impose data requirement
Unfortunately lack careful consideration backward flow decision analysis model required data often lead inadequate data collection system missing essential information
Proper prior planning prevents poor performance
Of particular importance plan track data unit failed
Units whose precise time failure unknown referred censored unit
Inexperienced analyst frequently know analyze censored data omit censored unit result
This bias analysis
An organization integrated data system allows reliability data considered logistical data part personnel tool bay transportation evacuation queue cost allowing total awareness interplay logistical RAM issue
These issue turn must integrated management operational system allow organization reap benefit occur complete situational awareness respect RAM
Because importance reliability availability maintainability well related attribute hundred standard associated
Some general specific domain automotive aviation electric power distribution nuclear energy rail transportation software many others
Standards produced governmental agency professional association international standard body The following table list selected standard agency
Because difference domain many standard handle topic slightly different way selection appropriate requires consideration previous practice often documented contractual requirement domain specific consideration certification agency requirement end user requirement different acquisition producing organization product system characteristic
effect analysis FMEA availability maintainability safety RAMS Energy Plans Electronic Engine Controls Design Development Manufacturing Government Systems Government Systems Government Systems Government Revision A Becoming reliability engineer requires education probability statistic well specific engineering domain product system development operation
A number university throughout world department reliability engineering also address maintainability availability research group course reliability safety often within context another discipline computer science system engineering civil engineering mechanical engineering bioengineering
Because academic engineering program full reliability department engineer working reliability educated discipline acquire additional skill additional coursework working qualified engineer
A certification reliability engineering available American Society Quality ASQ
However minority engineer working discipline certification
The three basic metric RAM surprisingly Reliability Maintainability Availability
Reliability characterized term parameter mean percentile reliability distribution
However case exponential distribution used single value mean time failure MTTF system mean time failure MTBF restorable system used
The metric defined total operating time nfails number failure Maintainability often characterized term exponential distribution mean time repair similarly calculated Where total time noutages number outage
As noted accounting downtime requires definition specificity
Down time might counted corrective maintenance action may include corrective preventive maintenance action
Where lognormal rather exponential distribution used mean time still calculated log downtime variance must known order fully characterize maintainability
Availability calculated total operating time downtime alternative function MTBF MTTR Mean Time To Repair
As case maintainability availability may qualified whether includes unplanned failure repair inherent availability downtime due cause including administrative delay staffing outage spare inventory deficiency operational availability
Probabilistic metric describe system performance RAM
Quantiles mean mode distribution used model RAM also useful
Availability additional definition characterizing downtime counted system
For downtime associated corrective maintenance count system
For downtime associated corrective preventive maintenance count system
Finally count source downtime including logistical administrative system
Availability also calculated instantaneously averaged interval reported asymptotic value
calculated easily care must taken analyze whether system settle settle asymptotic value well long take system approach asymptotic value
measure effect system reliability small improvement component reliability
It defined partial derivative system reliability respect reliability component
product component reliability consequence component failure frequency component failure result system failure
Criticality guide prioritizing reliability improvement effort
Many metric calculated directly integral involved intractable
They usually estimated using simulation
There wide range model estimate predict reliability Meeker Escobar
Simple model exponential distribution useful back envelope calculation
System model used combine probability surrogate failure rate restoration time component level find system level probability evaluate system maintainability single point failure failure propagation
The three common reliability block diagram fault tree failure mode effect analysis
There sophisticated probability model used life data analysis
These best characterized failure rate behavior defined probability unit fails next small interval time given lived beginning interval divided length interval
Models considered fixed environmental condition
They also extended include effect environmental condition system life
Such extended model turn used accelerated life testing ALT system deliberately carefully overstressed induce failure quickly
The data extrapolated usual use condition
This often way obtain estimate life highly reliable product reasonable amount time Nelson
Also useful characteristic system associated propensity unit fail Nelson
As characteristic degrades estimate time failure occur
The initial developmental unit system often meet RAM specification
allow estimation resource particularly testing time necessary system mature meet goal Meeker Escobar
describe time necessary return failed repairable system service
They usually sum set model describing different aspect maintenance process diagnosis repair inspection reporting evacuation
These model often threshold parameter minimum time event occur
attempt describe flow logistics system quantify interaction maintenance activity resource available support activity
Queue delay particular major source time repairable system
A logistical support model allows one explore trade space resource availability
All model abstraction reality best approximation reality
To extent provide useful insight still valuable
The complicated model data necessary estimate precisely
The greater extrapolation required prediction greater imprecision
Extrapolation often unavoidable high reliability equipment typically long life amount time required observe failure may exceed test time
This requires strong assumption made future life absence masked failure mode assumption increase uncertainty prediction
The uncertainty introduced strong model assumption often quantified present unavoidable risk system engineer
There many way characterize reliability system including fault tree reliability block diagram failure mode effect analysis
A Kececioglu graphical representation failure mode system
It constructed using logical gate AND OR NOT K N gate predominating
Fault tree complete partial partial fault tree focus failure mode mode interest
They allow see dependency system nested system system element
Fault tree pioneered Bell Labs
A Failure Mode Effects Analysis table list possible failure mode system likelihood effect failure
A Failure Modes Effects Criticality Analysis score effect magnitude product consequence likelihood allowing ranking severity failure mode Kececioglu
A RBD graphical representation reliability dependence system component
It directed acyclic graph
Each path graph represents subset system component
As long component path operational system operational
Component life usually assumed independent RBD
Simple topology include series system parallel system system combination
RBDs often nested one RBD serving component higher level model
These hierarchical model allow analyst appropriate resolution detail still permitting abstraction
RBDs depict path lead success fault tree depict path lead failure
A table list possible failure mode system likelihood effect failure
A score effect magnitude product consequence likelihood allowing ranking severity failure mode Kececioglu
System model require even data fit well
Garbage garbage GIGO particularly applies case system model
The specialized analysis required RAM drive need specialized software

MITRE system engineer SEs expected understand purpose role Reliability Availability Maintainability RAM acquisition process occurs system development benefit employing
MITRE SEs also expected understand recommend RAM appropriate situation process tailored meet program need
They expected understand technical requirement RAM well strategy process encourage help end user stakeholder actively participate RAM process
They expected monitor evaluate contractor RAM technical effort acquisition program overall RAM process recommend change warranted
Reliability wellspring RAM system attribute availability maintainability
Reliability first practiced early day National Aeronautics Space Administration NASA Robert Lusser working Wernher von Braun rocketry program developed known Lusser Law
Lusser Law state reliability system equal product reliability component equates weakest link concept
The term reliability often used overarching concept includes availability maintainability
Reliability purest form concerned probability failure occurring specified time interval whereas availability measure something state mission capable ready tasked available
Maintainability parameter concerned system use restored failure also considering concept like preventive maintenance BIT required maintainer skill level support equipment
When dealing availability requirement maintainability requirement must also invoked level repair restoration state must included
Clearly logistics logistic support strategy also closely related dependent variable play availability requirement
This take form sparing strategy maintainer training maintenance manual identification required support equipment
The linkage RAM requirement dependency associated logistics support illustrates RAM requirement direct impact sustainment overall LCC
In simple term RAM requirement considered upper level overarching requirement specified overall system level
It often necessary decompose upper level requirement lower level quantitative requirement Mean Time Between Failure MTBF MTBCF Mean Time To Repair MTTR
These lower level requirement specified system level however allocated subsystem assembly
The common allocation made Line Replaceable Unit LRU unit lowest level repair field often called organic level maintenance
Much discussion focused hardware complex system used today integrated solution consisting hardware software
Because software performance affect system RAM performance requirement software must addressed overall RAM requirement system
The wear accumulated stress mechanism characterize hardware failure cause software failure
Instead software exhibit behavior operator perceive failure
It critical user program office test community contractor agree early constitutes software failure
For example software malfunction often recoverable reboot time reboot may bounded software failure declared
Another issue consider frequency occurrence even software reboot recovers within defined time window give indication software stability
User perception constitutes software failure surely influenced need reboot frequency glitch operating software
One approach assessing software fitness use comprehensive model determine current readiness software shipment meet customer requirement
Such model need address quantitative parameter process element
In addition method organize streamline existing quality reliability data simple metric visualization applicable across product release
A novel quantitative software readiness criterion model developed support objective effective decision making product shipment
The model socialized various forum introduced MITRE work program consideration use contractor software development process assessing maturity
The model offer Using approach development test data measure growth maturity software system along following five dimension Many government acquisition program put greater emphasis reliability
The Defense Science Board DSB performed study Developmental Test Evaluation DT E May published finding linked test suitability failure lack disciplined system engineering approach included reliability engineering
The Department Defense DoD initial proponent systematic policy change address finding similar emphasis seen Department Homeland Security DHS many government agency leverage DoD policy process execution acquisition program
As evidenced strongest government support increased focus reliability come DoD requires program integrate reliability engineering system engineering process institute reliability growth part design development phase
The scope reliability involvement expanded directing reliability addressed Analysis Alternatives AoA process map reliability impact system LCC outcome
The strongest policy directive come Chairman Joint Chiefs Staff CJCS sustainment Key Performance Parameter KPP supporting Key System Attributes KSAs mandated DoD program
Elevation RAM requirement KPP supporting KSAs bring greater focus oversight program meeting requirement prone reassessment reevaluation program modification
Acquisition program office employ RAM subject matter expert SMEs tend produce consistent RAM requirement better oversight contractor RAM process activity
The MITRE SE opportunity reach back bring MITRE bear strategically engaging RAM SMEs early program
The upper level RAM requirement consistent lower level RAM input variable typically design related called technical performance specification
A review user requirement flow requirement contractual specification document released Request For Proposal RFP package must completed
If requirement inconsistent unrealistic program placed risk RAM performance contract award
RAM specialty called answer mail crisis rather key participant acquisition process

Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo

How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head

Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late

Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I

I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job

And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path

IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get

Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy

Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year

Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get

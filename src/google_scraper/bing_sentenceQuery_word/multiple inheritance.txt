feature computer object characteristic feature one parent object
It distinct single inheritance object class may inherit one particular object class
Multiple inheritance sensitive issue many year opponent pointing increased complexity ambiguity situation diamond problem may ambiguous parent class particular feature inherited one parent class implement said feature
This addressed various way including using
Alternate method object composition based inheritance also proposed address ambiguity
In OOP describes relationship two class one class class class
The child inherits method attribute parent allowing shared functionality
For example one might create variable class feature eating reproducing etc
define child class inherits feature without explicitly program adding new feature like
Multiple inheritance allows programmer use one totally orthogonal hierarchy simultaneously allowing inherit access feature within class
Languages support multiple inheritance include Java SE via CLOS via The EuLisp Object System TELOS via use class via Incremental Tcl earlier version
SOM runtime support multiple inheritance programming language targeting SOM implement new SOM class inherited multiple base
Some language implement although provide functionality true multiple inheritance
us inherit specific method implementation
us inherit multiple method
The diamond problem sometimes referred deadly diamond death ambiguity arises two class B C inherit A class D inherits B If method A B C D override version method D inherit B C
For example context class may inherit class appearance handling class inherit class
Now method called object method class overridden method method eventually called
It called diamond problem shape class inheritance diagram situation
In case class A top B C separately beneath D join two together bottom form diamond shape
Languages different way dealing problem repeated inheritance
Languages allow class derive one base class diamond problem
The reason language one implementation method level inheritance chain regardless repetition placement method
Typically language allow class implement multiple called Java
These protocol define method provide concrete implementation
This strategy used Delphi
All Smalltalk allow class implement multiple protocol
Moreover language allow interface called protocol Swift
Interfaces like abstract base class specify method signature without implementing behavior
Pure interface one Java version permit implementation instance data interface
Nevertheless even several interface declare method signature soon method implemented defined anywhere inheritance chain override implementation method chain superclass
Hence given level inheritance chain one implementation method
Thus method implementation exhibit Diamond Problem even interface

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

Multiple inheritance feature programming language class object inherits characteristic property one parent class object
This contrary single inheritance property allows object class inherit one specific object class
Although certain benefit associated multiple inheritance increase ambiguity complexity designed implemented properly
Unlike single inheritance multiple inheritance symmetrical merging asymmetric extension inheritance perspective
When characteristic one set depend characteristic set multiple inheritance likely advantageous
In word multiple inheritance useful separation characteristic object orthogonal set possible
Multiple inheritance useful case adapter pattern
It allows one interface adapted another
Another benefit multiple inheritance associated observer pattern
In pattern call keep list notified change calling one function
Examples programming language support multiple inheritance Python Perl Eiffel Dylan Curl Eulisp Tcl
Java one prominent programming language support multiple inheritance
However drawback associated multiple inheritance
The feature complicates method dispatch also brings additional scrutiny application
Multiple inheritance would need awareness dependency especially related method selection
Moreover protocol using multiple inheritance would need documentation using single inheritance

Multiple Inheritance feature object oriented concept class inherit property one parent class
The problem occurs exist method signature super class subclass
On calling method compiler determine class method called even calling class method get priority
Output From code see calling method fun using Test object cause complication whether call fun fun method
From code see On calling method fun using Test object cause complication whether call fun Beta fun method
Therefore order avoid complication Java support multiple inheritance class
Multiple inheritance supported Java using class handling complexity cause due multiple inheritance complex
It creates problem various operation like casting constructor chaining etc reason scenario actually need multiple inheritance better omit keeping thing simple straightforward
Output If remove implementation default method TestClass get compiler error
See sample run
If diamond interface issue none middle interface provide implementation root interface
If provide implementation implementation accessed using super keyword

This article kept following
Note suggested another article merged one
August UTC See also I commented reference CSS example inheritance CSS behave inheritance possible actually inherit class modify
Instead get override prior definition
I sure full disagreement
CSS definitely cascade really inherit
I almost removed change I realized month since I actually cursed design CSS trying get true inheritance I could remember specific well enough clearly detail
Maybe I go try CSS I remember I hate much wish
Oct UTC Tell ya next time I work CSS run reason dislike belief object oriented I rush give full narrative
Right I ca remember
BTW I prefer CSS nothing I dislike
Oct UTC Well standard call inheritance property loosely inherited child element part computer science coverage topic
Obviously pure representation I thinking writng
But article broader OOP computer science instead confined OOP view concept
OOP purist maybe right viewpoint general overview whole concept
Mike please let rip compare contrast produce good coverage similarity difference use inheritance CS
Oct UTC This something worm may onto
I invite refer several month worth discussion already
It surprising emotionally entangled one get seemingly simple issue naming article
I agree whatever happening CSS certainly kind relationship I would prefer principle implied current article since already covering
infancy need ton work I probably qualified please feel free improve
As might gather discussion disagreement whether inheritance make sense outside OOP context
I think area computer science inheritance concept yet nothing programming
CSS one open debate whether really called inheritance refers I think least mention
Of course limit CSS think circumstance outside OOP form inheritance used would great
Nov UTC Mike thanks sort thing I thought end writing sort thing I writing I thinking programmer mode
It part I want OOP version CS article
The Wikipedia descriptive prescriptive describe us term
Hence word processing easy understand introduction CSS really common use OOP another common use
The article need remarked either adjust definition include us multiple definition cover class meaning
Then get compare contrast refer article detail topic define use term
At point really comprehensive coverage inheritance mean field
And Inheritance OOP really purist mean inheritance CSS meaning
Nov UTC This comment part Controversial Articles list References contain link outside Wikipedia Here history concept Here content Inheritance expressed keyword Java relationship notation
The concept reifies relationship
Thus proposition Socrates Man state Nov UTC It seems article heading straight road Inheritance exists programming
The opening sentence even state inheritance creates relationship
There whether article exist reasonable justification existence notion inheritance make sense outside context OOP I think try make article inheritance occurs way computer science
Jan UTC OK I gon na dive rewrite
No offense contributed current version stand strongly structured towards programming concept inheritance I think article relatively short something like disambiguation page since already brief discussion potential alternate meaning inheritance broadly area CSS word processor style implementation inheritance concept language
Some mention also disagreement true inheritance believe inheritance make sense outside OOP case article even exist like believe least mention case word inheritance used even though true inheritance whatever kind
Here go Feb UTC Attempts reading topic lead way redirects expression even mentioned article
I wish people trigger happy redirects without actual work topic making sure loss way
In fact original topic stand enlightening redirects replaced
Inheritance dual view thing
I would rather say partially overlap concept
Also dual view stuff explained quite poorly IMHO article
Having said I discovered two inheritance page OOP Computer science frankly I lost interest
Good luck
October UTC The introduction currently read However far I understand term inheritance also used within framework class exist independent entity
I think usage reflected definition
June UTC currently redirects since creation
Is specific reason
Otherwise I would turn redirect
June UTC From second paragraph Categorization powerful mechanism number information processing
This make sense error somewhere
As I quite sure writer trying say rather correcting I make note someone else correct
In section meant
February UTC Hello
I suppose example text would certainly reinforce idea nicely
This one seems miss example common computer science article
July UTC Aijaz inheritance inheritance inheritance inheritance inheritance

learn share knowledge build career
I writing documentation language I wonder kind class would good example inheritance
Some common example Currently favorite I like Employee exactly look like fun
I found really obvious attribute bike
Same bicycle
Too abstract
The main problem class need even abstract attribute method
Does anyone better example simple class hierarchy
This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason The Animal class classic example class inheritance number reason
First obvious way extend underlying animal class
You likely start Mammal Bird Crustacean etc
Some class Mammal extend Animal adding attribute fairly obvious etc
Other problematic issue quite common developing class hierarchy quite obvious illustrate animal inheritance thing purpose explanation
Birds fly right
Well bird
So represent flying
There course classic solution wealth discussion information online solve problem tradeoff solution introduces
Thus I would highly recommend using Animal example richness available information example
I like hierarchy
The idea anything use stream without usually caring kind stream individual subclass handle storage differently

If interested interface great one iterate collection without caring underlying data structure
Auto Parts interesting example might I agree Jon Skeet stream example
Perhaps perfect one advantage example Bicycles person animal shape weapon would modelled inheritance real project
shape particular downright dangerous
That pet peeve inheritance
It often taught something used express hierarchy find
An employee person right
So Employee class inherit Person class
But person also LivingCreature better one class
And LivingCreature also Organism another class
And Organism feel free continue
I think nice someone somewhere actually taught inheritance explaining used force hierarchy whether beneficial
Streams device ChrisW example advantage make
You want able treat stream whether connected memory buffer file network socket
And hardware device lot behavior common could plausibly factored Device base class
Many people use Shapes example fact dangerous one
The problem arises intuitively decide square subclass rectangle
When come behavior square limited rectangle breaking substitutability
For example could ask rectangle object change height
If square subclass rectangle mean able ask square
However changing height square would mean square anymore
Of course could increase width accordingly would expect ask object declared type rectangle actually square underneath change height
It called aware serious OO development
Squares course sub rectangle instead sub
This difference approach
Like Jon I prefer Streams example
It difficult explain even cleary avoiding
If video game could something like What hierarchy algebraic expression
It excellent example us inheritance composition Then provide motivating example like Which would yield I think Shape good abstract class
There shape
The shape typically area shape volume
Both location mass center
Some suggestion Being game admirer I would love share I always fond But top three quote would fine
MountainBike sound exciting
You similar thing car course
I suggest
Nobody really model animal using software model device
I use show Chess piece
The base class general ChessPiece King Rook Bishop etc inherits
What I like example I like vehicle example allows relatively clean extension include interface discussion IAutomaticGearbox anyone
What et
Inheritance complex
Let start simplest behavior inheritance
Here inheriting behavior state
Both Person Animal Animate object exhibit IsAlive behavior
To use example I wrote using syntax problem understanding say
The best example came across read many book one us Shape
The best thing easily explain concept including tough one related OOPs like Class Object Inheritance Abstraction Encapsulation Polymorphism etc programmer irrelevant experience
Example Dog Animal Living thing Object A Dog Animal Living thing turn Object
You find good example class inheritance
Provides way encapsulate group individual factory common theme without specifying concrete class It behavioral design pattern defines program skeleton algorithm operation deferring step subclass
It design pattern allows behavior added individual object either statically dynamically without affecting behavior object class Refer post real world example Webshop could good option well
I like idea using Printers example
Say working HP Brother Lexmark entity need come program capable generating driver specific module variety operating system
After demonstrating inheritance move towards abstraction method
The init method Printer class good candidate abstraction
Subclasses need implement initialization process
You also extend example start demonstrating proper usage Interfaces Composition
What difference concept
Some printer may WiFi Bluetooth capability
Or Some InkJet printer may scanning capability feeder etc
How would implement
I think using printer closely related computer computer science general
You use example even demonstrate example deal networking embedded system PC SmartPhones IoT
The best one I always used Shapes
You etc
Methods also easy guess
Hierarchy Shapes I completely understand concern regarding relationship Rectangles Squares regarding Liskov substitution principle
However way preserve principle still Square subclass Rectangle
For example Python assume following We define Square following way This way always use Square instance whenever Rectangle instance needed thus preserving Liskov
Now experience also use Inheritance enforce policy usually restrictive
For example assume Shape class color property corresponding setter setColor
Assume want create RedShape class
How prevent client code changing color
Answer setColor method overriding
We redefined setColor RedShape
The setColor RedShape override one Shape client code change color RedShape instance
In way created restrictive subclass ability changing color violate substitution principle
This model useful base class generic abstract create specialized class limit feature available base class
You create chain subclass increasingly enabling feature available base class create class offer different combination feature available base class
Before I get flamed let reiterate usage pragmatic model take advantage mechanism inheritance polymorphism
It far removed romantic notion inheritance creating new class enhancing refining existing one

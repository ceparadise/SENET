This question already answer Specifically I seen used context text filtering
As predicate filter criterion
Is accurate
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
It term commonly used field Mathematical Logic
From In mathematics predicate either amount characteristic function indicator function relation
A function P true false called predicate X
When P predicate X sometimes say P property
predicate filter criterion A predicate part sentence contains verb tell something subject
For instance sentence Mike eating subject predicate eating
In context computer science interested stating fact rather testing condition purpose deciding whether something
The member instance predicate
It return assertion case eating
The predicate used decide whether feed person
Predicates often found form callback general use term function return bool based evaluation truth assertion
For sorting might want member function predicate
If come u sorting algorithm swap two fruit
There also term predicate
In English use like Graduation predicated upon attainment passing grade
It mean one thing depends another
In computer science use form word describe conditional execution
For instance CUDA programming assembly instruction whose execution predicate KATE prior result
That set predicate CAT flag true cause instruction executed false cause instruction treated NOP
Thus execution instruction predicated upon indicated predicate flag
The us similar
Hope help
The word come logic
A predicate boolean question input
IsNull predicate question
Also wikipedia link
A predicate statement something either true false
Proposition Predicate Use quantifier transform predicate proposition Just simplify thing
predicate function return true false value
used filter criterion meaning let consider array number predicate return true number false wise
filter function return new array based predicate filter criterion
filtered array based value predicate Predicate function take one element input parameter return either true false
Predicates used higher order function applied given function transformer list element return list result
Transformer function applies element produce one new element

In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Software In use
You also need editor development environment writing debugging program
In using programming environment specially designed Python programming included Python distribution
These program available installation personal computer see
A programming language tool use construct sequence instruction tell computer want
There hundred programming language world
Over course career I taught programming class using least six different language
There best language though I could nominate candidate worst
Different language better worse different kind application
MATLAB example great language manipulating vector matrix
C good language writing program control data network
In course use Python
Python relatively recent addition universe language still growing popularity
I want emphasize course Python
You certainly learn Python good thing
What much important however learn write program solve problem given set basic primitive way combining complex element abstract primitive
This skill transferred many language
You install software personal computer operating system Windows MacOS X
For Windows need OS X need version Python work version NOT compatible
Below direct link common Python installers Download install For OS X Yosemite earlier download install
For OS X El Capitan later download install Python OS Anaconda come numpy matplotlib preinstalled along many python library may ignore installation instruction library Pset
On Python homepage latest version available download actually
Do install
This version backwards compatible code writing course example type print test instead print test
Instead sure download version listed
IDLE standard Python development environment
Its name acronym ntegrated eve opment nvironment
It work well Unix Windows platform
It Python shell window give access Python interactive mode
It also file editor let create edit existing Python source file
During following discussion IDLE feature instead passively reading along start IDLE try replicate action
You type Python code directly shell prompt
Whenever enter complete code fragment executed
For instance typing pressing Enter cause following displayed IDLE also used calculator Addition subtraction multiplication operator built Python language
This mean use right away
If want use square root calculation need module
Do worry mean right cover later course
Below example square root calculation Math module allows number useful operation Note need execute import command start IDLE

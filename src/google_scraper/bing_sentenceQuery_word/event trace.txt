In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
When testing complex example sometimes necessary test number condition time
A also called used record outcome test

Two kind logging available Planning Server event log trace log
Event logging Planning Server major event written Windows Event Viewer
By default event logging turned
Information provided event log entry usually describes basic event briefly
Event log entry indicate success failure major Planning Server functionality major degradation functionality
Administrators may notified issue Windows Event Viewer time use trace log investigate issue
See Windows Server documentation information configure Windows Event Log
You reduce denial service attack example event log configuration
The following Windows Event Viewer log level available Planning Server
Event error serious error IT administrator notified immediately
Event error used communicate significant tolerable intolerable failure system cause loss failure important functionality

Event warning used communicate tolerable failure system immediately significant could become critical addressed
A warning indicates condition could cause fatal error requires administrator determine whether error

Event information message communicate significant successful progress state system
At event level message basic

Not financial auditing
Audit failure intended track logon failure issue failure access resource
Example valid user
Planning Server write Windows Event Viewer one additional log level
Not financial auditing
Audit success indicates successful transaction user successfully logging onto system
These entry include name computer running Planning Server user accessed successfully
They also include name IP address computer running Planning Server client request originated
By default trace logging
It must enabled member Global Administrator role
Trace log specific detailed event log
Trace log level include Windows Event Viewer level described earlier plus following list
Trace error occur within Planning Server indicate user error operation error application error might prevent Planning Server functioning correctly
Trace error fixed Planning Server administrator pose threat others user system data center IT environment
Example Failure update account dimension

Trace warning potential threat Planning Server functionality affect user system data center
Like event log warning trace warning require administrator determine whether warning condition error
Example Insufficient permission

These entry record progress significant event related Planning Server
Example Created new dimension XYZ

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In computer science technical writing especially software engineering difference fault error defect
I want quote To quote Typically word used refers defined
However different culture standard may use somewhat different meaning term led attempt define
Partial definition taken standard Error computed result correct Fault incorrect step process data definition computer Failure incorrect result Mistake human action produce incorrect Based understanding definition error result fault failure
Could someone explain clearly
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
This question came site academic enrolled higher education
According A system event occurs delivered service deviate correct service
A system may fail either comply specification specification adequately describe function
An part system state may cause subsequent failure failure occurs error reach service interface alters service
A adjudged hypothesized cause error
I understand another name fault
confusing represent fault failure depending context
With reference definition used linked article error result fault potentially cause error outside tolerance system
Most system dealing real data degree error designed tolerate

system designed around concept
In essence must able continue working level satisfaction presence fault
Fault tolerance property individual machine may also characterise rule interact
For example TCP designed allow reliable communication even presence communication link imperfect overloaded
It requiring endpoint communication packet loss duplication reordering corruption condition damage data integrity reduce throughput proportional amount
Recovery error system characterised either
When system detects made error recovery take system state time corrects able move forward
recovery reverts system state back earlier correct version example using move forward
recovery requires operation checkpoint detected erroneous state made
Some system make use recovery different error different part one error
Most designed handle several possible failure including fault failure failure temporary permanent failure error interface error hardware software including failure operator error erroneous keystroke bad command sequence installing unexpected software physical damage flaw introduced system outside source
Hardware common application system designed prevent failure due hardware component
Most basically provided particularly
Typically component multiple backup separated smaller segment act contain fault extra redundancy built physical connector power supply fan etc
There special software instrumentation package designed detect failure fault masking way ignore fault seamlessly preparing backup component execute something soon instruction sent using sort voting protocol main backup give result flawed output ignored
Software based around nullifying programming error using redundancy static emergency subprogram fill program crash
There many way conduct depending application available hardware
The first known computer built
Its basic design connected via relay voting method detection
Several machine developed along line mostly military use
Eventually separated three distinct category machine would last long time without maintenance one used computer dependable required constant monitoring used monitor control experiment finally computer high amount runtime would heavy use many supercomputer used monitoring
Most development LLNM Long Life No Maintenance computing done NASA preparation research aspect
NASA first machine went second attempt JSTAR computer used
This computer backup memory array use memory recovery method thus called JPL computer
It could detect error fix bring redundant module needed
The computer still working today
computer pioneered mostly manufacturer company USA
These needed computer massive amount uptime would enough fault allow continued operation relying fact computer output would constantly monitored human detect fault
Again IBM developed first computer kind NASA guidance rocket later built
The redundancy
In general early effort design focused mainly internal diagnosis fault would indicate something failing worker could replace
SAPO instance method faulty memory drum would emit noise failure
Later effort showed fully effective system diagnosing isolating fault implementing redundant backup alerting need repair
This known redundancy fault cause automatic fail safe warning operator still common form level one design use today
Voting another initial method discussed multiple redundant backup operating constantly checking result outcome example four component reported answer one component reported answer four would vote fifth component faulty taken service
This called M N majority voting
Historically motion always move M N due fact complexity system difficulty ensuring transitive state disrupt operation
among first company specializing design computer system
The important requirement design computer system making sure actually meet requirement reliability
This done using various failure model simulate various failure analyzing well system reacts
These complex involving probability curve specific fault rate curve error rate like
The commonly used model HARP SAVE SHARPE USA SURF LASS Europe
Research kind tolerance needed critical system involves large amount interdisciplinary work
The complex system carefully possible interaction considered prepared
Considering importance system transport military field topic touch research wide include obvious subject reliability arcane element model formal exclusionary logic remote
technique enables continue executing despite
The technique handle attempt read invalid memory returning manufactured value program turn make use manufactured value ignores former value tried access
This great contrast inform program error abort program
In computing attempt made inform program error occurred
The approach performance cost technique rewrite code insert dynamic check address validity execution time increase
Recovery shepherding lightweight technique enable software program recover otherwise fatal error null pointer dereference divide zero
Comparing failure oblivious computing technique recovery shepherding work compiled program binary directly need recompile program
It us framework
It attache application process error occurs repair execution track repair effect execution continues contains repair effect within application process detaches process repair effect flushed process state
It interfere normal execution program therefore incurs negligible overhead
For systematically collected real world error prototype implementation enables application continue execute provide acceptable output service user input

Recently I found computer noisy make many noise
Perhaps emits wave together harmful radiation
I know I dislike much
I switched power button plug
Later I switched power button computer computer one light abnormally
Normally two light operating properly
Of course could used moment
Nothing screen
The connection monitor machine seemed order I think
I waited several minute ran
It needed warm
What matter
Emmm checked fan
Maybe faulty causing CPU motherboard heat Running diagnostics
CD came machine find stuff manufacturer site least usually might bad idea see something fundamentally wrong
Hmmm kind warm problem usually something say motherboard battery something kind
fan loose broken HDD hard drive disk sometimes heard probably simple problem like HDD must ignore check fan loose screw something opening case
often happen noticed performance issue lot heat something
Perhaps emits wave together harmful radiation
I know I dislike much
I switched power button plug
Later I switched power button computer computer one light abnormally
Normally two light operating properly
Of course could used moment
Nothing screen
The connection monitor machine seemed order I think
I waited several minute ran
It needed warm
What matter
Do hear beep turn light messed hard drive read light power light
Normally base two light one green light one red light
In case show one red light CD Rom Driver continuously light open rom I press
How going My Rom
That might tricky reason oh one sec first post saying firstly heard dodgy noise THEN screen totaly blank cant see anything
totaly black blank screen

This person Why implementation different distributed consensus system like
In part answer replied For one designed account arbitrary failure
If participant fails telling different peer different thing consensus fails
In context blockchain would equivalent malicious consensus participant lying
Another wrote As others mentioned Blockchain Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Raft consensus based system
My question Actually difference intricate
A problem might property blockchains well specified term used wide variety thing going far simple database marketing
So let see
When designing fault tolerant system multiple property take account
These include Should system designed withstand node stopping anything
message also consider node exhibit arbitrary behaviour
Should system provide certainty state final revertible okay irreversibility high probability
Is known advance node participating protocol

reliable database used google defined number node known node
In Bitcoin unclear even many miner participating consensus algorithm
There thing important one
I regularly contacted people want use blockchain technology conversation always come figuring requirement regarding three property I recommend system
For well known one property When choosing system try take easiest one possible stronger model normally come large penalty latency throughput transaction
Crash failure easier byzantine failure
This easy show byzantine failure include crash failure
Most algorithm include kind voting
Having majority sufficient crash failure make decision byzantine failing node might send different vote different receiver
This might lead two honest node seeing different result overall vote getting sync
Open membership much difficult closed membership sibyl attack attacker generates many identity need counteracted something like
This main new thing Bitcoin invented created blockchain hype
A chain block transaction existed batched commits transaction standard thing least year Bitcoin
Applying algorithm I listed The overhead RAFT small PBFT Zyzzyva already significant amount communication overhead O message large number signature
Systems like Bitcoin Ethereum latency order minute hour depending required level security
By posting answer agree

A close look fault help geologist understand tectonic plate moved relative one another
Types movement crustal block occur along fault earthquake University Otago Richard Sibson
Where crust pulled apart occurs overlying block move respect lower foot wall block

Where crust compressed occurs block move footwall block reverse slip gently inclined plane referred thrust faulting

Crustal block may also move sideways past usually along fault
This movement described sinistral far side move left dextral far side move right

An involves various combination basic movement Wairarapa Fault rupture included reverse dextral movement
COM pg

Faults short metre long
The fault rupture earthquake always straight continuous line
Sometimes short offset part fault even major fault large bend

A contiguous block described single entry
It smallest unit data memory management virtual memory
Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation
Starting processor support MiB page called MiB page using addition standard KiB page newer processor newer processor later processor use GiB page
support many eight different page size KiB MiB architecture similar feature
Larger page despite available processor used contemporary common use except application application typically found large server operating system
Commonly use requires elevated privilege cooperation application making large allocation usually setting flag ask operating system huge page manual administrator configuration operating system commonly sometimes design page disk
However support multiple page size
Each individual process provide hint operating system automatically use largest page size possible given region address space
supported huge page several architecture since series via filesystem without hugetlbfs since
newer support huge page name page
support large page internally expose application
beginning version support large page
FreeBSD feature superpages
Note recently Linux application needed modified order use huge page
The kernel introduced support transparent use huge page
On Linux kernel supporting transparent huge page well FreeBSD Solaris application take advantage huge page automatically without need modification

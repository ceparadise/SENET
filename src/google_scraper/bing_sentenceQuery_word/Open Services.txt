Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right
IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year
Random Awesomeness said discourage people KIDS especially woman want computer please give reason people computer science
Wolfee GameZ said Yea boi game design would good choice knowing code knowing language
Would also help look animation easier opinion
Those two major thing used game
yeye John Doe said Hey everyone Thanks comment really helped
I college student getting basic way
I always loved computer I pretty good user level
I know HTML access command stuff I never formal education tried learn another coding language I never failed math generally making Bs As strongest subject
Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get
Any advice appreciated thank much
Chris said I trying pursue computer science degree I get gaming industry
I also thinking something creative writing well
Muhammad Ibrahim said After I graduated computer science department Bachelor degree Then I choose specialize PROGRAMMING Masters degree Sir could I restudy PROGRAMMING PHD
Although computer Science course many possible
Vandana kumari said Sir I Indian pursueing diploma Computer science I want take admission Tech
Sir I want acquire knowledge computer sir please direct I learn

To layperson computer science information technology may seem like thing
In actuality three field typically associated study computer college level
Computer engineering computer science discipline within realm study
However specialty focus specific aspect field career within three area vary greatly
Computer scientist fact scientist
They focused theory computational application
That mean understand behind computer program
Using algorithm advanced mathematics computer scientist invent new way manipulate transfer information
Computer scientist generally concerned software operating system implementation
Like Neo The Matrix computer scientist see make sense code
Computer science student learn fundamental different programming language linear discrete mathematics software design development
Computer scientist study machine understand various computer process operate way
Simply put computer scientist talk computer
The field based language computer
Computer scientist understand computer work create program operating system want
Computer science rapidly growing field expected see large increase employment opportunity
High salary generally associated computer science career
If pursuing computer science degree following career path open To put bluntly computer engineer make computer part work together
Computer engineer responsible research design development computer equipment like circuit board microchip router video card etc
Some university may treat discipline electrical engineering
It beneficial computer engineer grasp computer science
Computer engineer often deal integration meaning design build processor hardware support given program
As technology advance device become smaller smaller main goal computer engineer create microchip microprocessor work economically efficiently
Computer engineering student study concept computer science engineering mathematics
By combining three field computer engineer able solve hardware problem create machine handle many task computer perform
There lot diversity job title computer engineering world
Diversity job come various industry employ computer engineer
You find employment rate computer engineer work Information technology IT may adopt moniker information system system administration

Successful IT candidate posse strong critical thinking skill IT professional tasked resourcefully applying tool disposal
At every level shop multinational corporation business need IT
Over next decade career opportunity IT expected grow faster average
Depending level education degree IT provide comfortable paycheck
To sum maybe oversimplify bit computer engineer design build computer
Computer scientist design develop computer program software application
IT professional use troubleshoot program software application
These three profession work together make sure hardware software user interface UI come together smoothly computer carry task business individual need
It might help imagine like Computer engineer architect construction worker
They design build house
Computer scientist electrician plumber installation specialist put light running water appliance house
IT professional live house use appliance effectively efficiently desired effect
There overlap within three field
Essentially exist subsection discipline performing complementary different task fit together like gear
Hopefully distinction three professional area clear

Active debate economics reliability various way providing open access continues among researcher academic librarian university administrator funding agency government official commercial editorial staff publisher open access gradually gain acceptance
The term open access first formulated three public statement February June October initial concept open access refers unrestricted online access scholarly research primarily intended scholarly journal article
The Budapest statement defined open access follows There many degree kind wider easier access literature
By access literature mean free availability public internet permitting user read download copy distribute print search link full text article crawl indexing pas data software use lawful purpose without financial legal technical barrier inseparable gaining access internet
The constraint reproduction distribution role copyright domain give author control integrity work right properly acknowledged cited
The Bethesda Berlin statement add work open access user must able copy use distribute transmit display work publicly make distribute derivative work digital medium responsible purpose subject proper attribution authorship
Despite statement emerging idea practise providing free online access journal article began least decade term open access formally coined
Computer scientist since physicist since
The generalize practice posted
In order reflect actual practice providing open access distinction gratis open access libre open access added two original definition
Gratis open access refers free online access libre open access refers free online access plus additional right
The Budapest Bethesda Berlin definition corresponded libre OA
The right libre OA often specified various specific almost require authorship original author
Open access mostly green gratis began sought provided worldwide researcher possibility opened advent
The momentum increased growing movement academic journal publishing reform gold libre OA
Electronic publishing created new benefit compared paper publishing beyond contributed causing problem traditional publishing model
The premise behind open access publishing viable funding model maintain traditional standard quality also making following change The open access movement motivated problem social inequality caused restricting access academic research favor large wealthy institution financial mean purchase access many journal well economic challenge perceived unsustainability academic publishing
The intended audience research article usually researcher
Open access help researcher reader opening access article library subscribe
One great beneficiary open access may user currently find difficult pay subscription required access recent journal
Some scheme exist providing subscription scientific publication affiliated institution developing country little cost
All researcher benefit open access library afford subscribe every afford small fraction known
Open access extends reach research beyond immediate academic circle
An open access article read anyone field another field interested
Indeed study revealed roughly twice likely read relevant article freely available
The main reason author make article openly accessible maximize
A study first reported open access advantage growing number study confirmed varying degree methodological rigor open access article likely used cited one behind subscription barrier
For example study found article published immediate open access three time likely cited access paper also cited article
This result challenged artifact author paying publish higher quality article hybrid open access journal whereas study found open access citation advantage equally big whether mandated
Scholars paid research funders university research published article report work done rather item commercial gain
The article used cited applied built upon better research well researcher career
Open access reduce publication delay obstacle led research field physic adopt widespread preprint access
Some professional organization encouraged use open access communicated member Open access mathematical literature important goal encouraged make available electronically much work feasible enlarge reservoir freely available primary mathematical material particularly helping scientist working without adequate library access
agency university want ensure research fund support various way greatest possible research impact
As mean achieving research funders beginning expect open access research support
Many including seven UK Research Councils already adopted green open access mandate others way see
A growing number university providing institutional repository researcher deposit published article
Some open access advocate believe institutional repository play important role responding open access mandate funders
EnablingOpenScholarship EPS provides university OA

These librarian believe open access promise remove undermine library effort provide access scholarly record well helping address
Many library association either signed major open access declaration created
For example endorsed Resolution Open Access June
Librarians also lead education outreach initiative faculty administrator others benefit open access
For example developed Scholarly Communications Toolkit
The documented need increased access scholarly information leading founder SPARC
At university library manages institutional repository provides free access scholarly work university faculty

An increasing number library provide hosting service open access journal
A survey Association Research Libraries found surveyed library either planning become involved near future
In open access activist posthumously awarded American Library Association outspoken advocate public participation government unrestricted access scholarly article
In March entire editorial board resigned en masse citing dispute journal publisher
One board member wrote crisis conscience publishing journal open access death Aaron Swartz
The pioneer open access movement France one first librarian advocate approach open access worldwide Hélène Bosc
Her work described retrospective
Open access scholarly research argued important public number reason
One argument public access scholarly literature research paid taxpayer therefore right access result funded
This one primary reason creation advocacy group The Alliance Taxpayer Access US
Examples people might wish read scholarly literature include individual medical condition family member individual serious hobbyist scholar may interested specialized scientific literature

Additionally professional many field may interested continuing education research literature field many business academic institution afford purchase article subscription much research literature published toll access model
Even read scholarly article benefit indirectly open access
For example patient benefit doctor professional access latest research
As argued open access advocate open access speed research progress productivity knowledge translation
Every researcher world read article whose library afford subscribe particular journal appears
Faster discovery benefit everyone
High school student gain information literacy skill critical knowledge age
Critics various open access initiative claim little evidence significant amount scientific literature currently unavailable would benefit
While library subscription every journal might benefit virtually published research acquired via
Note interlibrary loan may take day week depending loaning library whether scan email mail article
Open access online contrast faster often immediate making suitable interlibrary loan research
In developing nation open access archiving publishing acquires unique importance
Scientists health care professional institution developing nation often capital necessary access scholarly literature although scheme exist give access little cost
Among important Health InterNetwork Access Research Initiative sponsored
HINARI however also restriction
For example individual researcher may register user unless institution access several country one might expect access access even access
South Africa
Many open access project involve international collaboration
For example Scientific Electronic Library Online comprehensive approach full open access journal publishing involving number country
dedicated helping publisher developing country collaboration people UK Canada Brazil Bioline International Software used around world
RePEc collaborative effort volunteer country
The developed publishing software OJS use around world example group one active development group Portuguese
This international perspective resulted advocacy development necessary open access relevant information
There various way open access provided two common method usually categorised either gold green open access
One option author wish make work openly accessible publish open access journal gold open access
There many business model open access journal
Open access provided traditional publisher may publish open access well journal open access publisher PLOS publish open access journal
An open access journal may may charge open access publishing necessarily mean author pay
Traditionally many academic journal levied page charge long open access became possibility
When open access journal charge processing fee author employer research funder typically pay fee individual author many journal waive fee case financial hardship author country
Some journal institutional subsidy
Examples open access publisher include
Roughly gold open access journal author fee cover cost publishing
PLoS fee vary instead reader subscription fee
Advertising revenue funding foundation institution also used provide funding
also known green open access refers practice depositing article
Green open access journal publisher endorse immediate open access author
Open access first formally proposed
However already done computer scientist local archive later harvested
What deposited either either author refereed revised final draft publisher version record
To find publisher journal given green light author author check Publisher Copyright Policies list web site

Like green open access article gold open access journal article distributed via due low distribution cost increasing reach speed increasing importance scholarly communication
sometimes used aspect open access provision open access publishing
Access online content requires Internet access distributional consideration present physical sometimes financial barrier access
Proponents open access argue Internet access barrier relatively low many circumstance effort made subsidize universal Internet access whereas present relatively high additional barrier Internet access
The list number open access journal browsing searching
Open access article also often found using general specialized scholarly scientific literature
Many university research institution research funders adopted mandate requiring researcher provide open access research article open access repository
Some publisher publisher association lobbied introducing mandate
The idea mandating mooted least early
Since effort focused open access mandating funders research government research funding agency university
The ROARMAP searchable international database charting growth
As December mandate registered university including Harvard MIT Stanford University College London University Edinburgh research funders worldwide
The often used open access journal shift burden payment reader author funders creates new set concern
One concern publisher make profit accepting paper incentive accept anything submitted rather selecting rejecting article based quality
This could remedied however charging rather acceptance
Another concern institutional budget may need adjusted order provide funding article processing charge required publish many open access journal
published
It argued may reduce ability publish research result due lack sufficient fund leading research becoming part public record
Unless discount available author country low income external funding provided cover cost article processing charge could exclude author developing country le research field publishing open access journal
However traditional model prohibitive cost access journal subscription already place heavy burden research community green open access eventually make subscription unsustainable cancelled subscription saving pay publishing cost without need divert extra money research
Moreover many open access publisher offer discount publishing fee waiver author developing country suffering financial hardship
access publication provides low cost alternative model
Another concern redirection money major funding agency National Institutes Health direct support research support open access publication
Robert Terry Senior Policy Advisor Wellcome Trust said feel research budget change creation knowledge dissemination knowledge
Research institution could cover cost open access converting model institution annual tool access subscription saving available cover annual open access publication cost
A study annual turnover academic publisher amount approximately EUR billion
It argued money come predominantly publicly funded scientific library purchase subscription license order provide access scientific journal member
The study presented Max Planck Digital Library found subscription budget would sufficient fund open access publication charge
Even advent Internet various model proposed increase access academic research
One early proponent model physicist
To help stem flood publication jokingly suggested beginning career issued voucher pay paper
Closer present still ahead time
This attempt share information good brainchild formerly The Library Corporation
Both Brower Common Knowledge recognised Library Microcomputer Hall Fame
One earliest publication published Gujarati recognised intellectual blueprint India freedom movement
The book translated English next year copyright legend read No Rights Reserved
The modern open access movement trace history least back LI placing anything journal public domain
As LI merged form wrote Patrick Straram All material published Situationist International principle usable everyone even without acknowledgement without preoccupation literary property
This facilitate
It became much prominent advent
With spread ability copy distribute electronic data cost argument open access gained new importance
The fixed cost producing article separable minimal marginal cost online distribution
Probably earliest book publisher provide open access publisher arm
They provided free online edition book alongside priced printed edition since assert online edition promote sale print edition
As June book online browsing searching reading
While made first major biomedical journal freely available web
Varki wrote The vexing issue day appropriately charge user electronic access
The nonprofit nature JCI allows consideration truly novel solution charge anyone
An explosion interest activity open access journal occurred since largely due widespread availability access
It possible publish scholarly article make instantly accessible anywhere world computer Internet connection
The fixed cost producing article separable minimal marginal cost online distribution
These new possibility emerged time traditional scholarly journal system crisis
The number journal article produced increasing steady rate however average cost per journal rising rate far decade budget academic library remained fairly static
The result decreased access ironically technology made almost unlimited access real possibility first time
Libraries librarian played important part open access movement initially alerting faculty administrator serial crisis
The Association Research Libraries developed SPARC alliance academic research library organization address crisis develop promote alternative open access
The first journal eventually called open access journal began appearing late early
These journal typically used infrastructure volunteer labor developed without intent generate profit
Examples include
The first free scientific online archive started initially preprint service physicist initiated
become norm physic physic physic rate
The prior existence preprint culture physic one major reason arXiv successful
arXiv includes paper related discipline including computer science mathematics nonlinear science quantitative biology quantitative finance statistic
However computer scientist mostly website even longer physicist
arXiv includes postprints well preprints
The two major physic publisher Publishing reported arXiv effect journal subscription physic even though article freely available usually publication physicist value journal continue support
Computer scientist site website since even earlier physicist revealed began harvesting paper late
Citeseer computer science archive harvest distributed computer science website contains almost twice many paper arXiv
The extend discipline arose eventually generic software
In NLM made comprehensive index medical literature planet freely available form
Usage database increased tenfold became free strongly suggesting prior limit usage impacted lack access
While index main focus open access movement Medline important opened whole new form use public professional
The one first open access journal medicine created publishing first issue

We discus open source software basic behind Open Source Initiative OSI Free Software Licensing
refers program software form program programmer writes program particular programming language available general public use modification original design free charge
Open source code typically created collaborative effort programmer improve upon code share change within community
The rationale movement larger group concerned proprietary ownership financial gain produce useful product everyone use
The concept relies peer review find eliminate program code process commercially developed packaged employ
The basic behind Open Source Initiative programmer read redistribute modify source code piece software evolves
Open source sprouted technological community response proprietary software owned corporation
Proprietary software privately owned controlled
In computer industry proprietary considered opposite open
A proprietary design technique one owned company
It also implies company divulged specification would allow company duplicate product
Open Source certification standard issued OSI indicates source code computer program made available free charge general public
OSI dictate order considered OSI Certified product must meet following criterion Open source software normally distributed source code open source license
The Open Source Initiative set following distribution term software must comply Open source mean access source code
The distribution term software must comply following criterion The license shall restrict party selling giving away software component aggregate software distribution containing program several different source
The license shall require royalty fee sale
The program must include source code must allow distribution source code well compiled form
Where form product distributed source code must mean obtaining source code reasonable reproduction cost preferably downloading via Internet without charge
The source code must preferred form programmer would modify program
Deliberately obfuscated source code allowed
Intermediate form output preprocessor translator allowed The license must allow modification derived work must allow distributed term license original software
The license may restrict distributed modified form license allows distribution patch file source code purpose modifying program build time
The license must explicitly permit distribution software built modified source code
The license may require derived work carry different name version number original software
The license must discriminate person group person
The license must restrict anyone making use program specific field endeavor
For example may restrict program used business used genetic research
The right attached program must apply program redistributed without need execution additional license party
The right attached program must depend program part particular software distribution
If program extracted distribution used distributed within term program license party program redistributed right granted conjunction original software distribution
The license must place restriction software distributed along licensed software
For example license must insist program distributed medium must software
No provision license may predicated individual technology style interface
All open source software distributed licensing agreement
Some may use free software license copyleft GPL compatible
The GNU GPL license free software license copyleft license GNU Lesser General Public License free software license strong copyleft license
There many different type license free software
GNU GPL compatible
The Open Source Initiative approves open source license successfully gone approval process comply Open Source Definition
There currently well fifty license approved OSI
For example GNU General Public License GPL one license accompanies open source software detail software accompany source code freely copied distributed modified
The widespread use GPL reference GNU GPL commonly abbreviated simply GPL understood term refers GNU GPL
One basic tenet GPL anyone acquires material must make available anyone else licensing agreement
The GPL cover activity copying distributing modifying source code
Other open source license include following A software programmer really reason contributing open source project
Some may looking fun challenge others looking improve skill build programming ability may want belong group project
In many instance opportunity make money open source project funded government corporate sponsor
Unlike commercial project open source project allow programmer name known benefit programmer name portfolio lead future job funded open source commercial project
The hype benefit open source gone unnoticed commercial world corporation jumped open source bandwagon
Since commercial software sold profit one may wonder company would interested open source project
In many case company able profit selling tool module paid consulting service technical support program

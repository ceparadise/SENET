Deployment context network administration refers process setting new computer system point ready productive work live environment
Deploy refer type installation
For example could setting new LAN building server installing software etc
The key point matter much planning done actual rolling new product new project truley succeeds fails
Everything look good paper live environment real user true test system

activity make available use
The general deployment process consists several interrelated activity possible transition
These activity occur side side
Because every software system unique precise within activity hardly defined
Therefore deployment interpreted customized according specific requirement characteristic
A brief description activity presented later
When computer extremely large expensive bulky software often bundled together hardware manufacturer
If needed installed existing computer might require expensive visit
For complex installation today still sometimes case
However development software new age came new form software distribution first later
This meant software deployment could left customer
However also increasingly recognised time configurability software customer important ideally interface rather example requiring customer edit registry entry Windows
In software deployment deployment closely related cousin new software release necessity expensive infrequent bulky affair
It arguable therefore spread internet made possible
Indeed advent meant software could deployed large number customer minute internet
This also meant typically deployment schedule determined software supplier customer
Such flexibility led rise viable option especially le risky
The complexity variability software product fostered emergence specialized role coordinating engineering deployment process
For desktop system frequently also become software deployers install software package machine
The deployment involves many role role typically change application progress test production environment
Typical role involved software deployment enterprise application may include

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I My colleague talked deploying server
I new computer world I understand mean
Could explain please deploying server
Best regard Ragims Questions Server Fault expected relate server networking related infrastructure administration within scope
Consider editing question leaving comment improvement believe question reworded fit within scope
Read
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
As Network Specialist typical task I expect involved deploying new server would I sure people recommend lot item list You think synonym
To deploy software server installing software server
To deploy server might either actually unpacking server box mount server rack installing OS
Deploying server mean different thing typically mean put production providing service needed made available use

go production application Deploying server basically mean copying file set file another machine another folder depending server running local another machine
It simple
More context would needed provide better answer

I small developer solution I created run IIS someone desktop computer small office environment
When I develop solution VWD Express I laptop file literally wwwroot folder computer designated web server small office manager
When I finished I setup IIS point wwwroot add computer server name everyone intranet exception list bam I done
So point deployment come
Looking forward guidance
The definition deployment change depending several factor
Including version studio using whether building web site web application
In purest form act copying file location run
Deploying web site usually copying file
Deploying web application usually involves compiling code behind assembly copying aspx page assembly actual code
However build deployment script go include thing like setting IIS running test assemblines etc
Also script might include publishing current dependency site like web service might include pushing time
In world deployment usually mean migrating code one environment another
This mean compiling DLLs custom code written used website
may Domain Objects class library code behind site us well configuring various file proper database used hostnames may set thing handled various script
For example going development test environment UAT production environment deployment example
may something else learn another use term deployment
Software deployment activity make software system available use
Deployment website mean build website precompile upload precompiled file server also deployment process include configuring IIS DB connection exist
But also copying file server without precompile work
From MSDN us bytecode go wiki Common Language Runtime
If upload file monitored IIS recompiled fresh bytecode time change
It probably better idea deploy compiled bytecode version since one version source outside source control anyone try find security hole lot harder
See ever developing web site web application run IIS
usually developing run web sit default development server useful application would finalize Error free ready produce appropriate put
tat user want access web site browser development server VS SDK
deploy web site IIS browser access web site trough URL user
per mention us bytecode
ever browser request IIS page IIS recompiled code fresh bytecode time
hence deploy code pre compile code store IIS
return without converting
put deploy code IIS see Your title say however I think help provide background
Deployments done essentially software whose production separate development software
In context past deployment necessarily involve compiling
In past application software programmer would usually compile software compiled software would provided
The source code would get copied production library executable file would copied separately
Deployment also called promotion many year ago I developed simple promotion system
Software developed use business organization separate development test environment production environment deployment process development environment production environment
Ideally would also staging environment I know possible

In writing Test case I know first identify Test point Test Condition
What Test Item Test Condition identify
Please explain example
Test item The individual element tested
There basically many test item test object actually tested
No need quote example since quite
Test condition An item event component system could verified one test case
function transaction feature quality attribute structural element
For example field signup form test condition could like It start It contain utmost two digit character first input character
Test condition condition Process follow test application
Ex You Have Login Form
Test Condition User Name Password valid Then application move forward
The one test condition basic Condition test process get pas
Test Item test item indicates item need test software application need test
Example Suppose starting test eCommerce site initially need test item required need validate customer registration form process main item Test Item The individual element tested
There usually one test object many test item
Test Condition An item event component system could verified one test case function transaction feature quality attribute structural element
For example Test Object Login form Test Item Login authentication Test Condition username password blank username blank password invalid Is helpful
In context IEEE test plan test item refers code package tested
According textbook test item software item object testing
A software item one item source code object code job control code control data
First take username password valid Username Password accept min character Username field accept Alphanumerics password accept alphanumerics special symbol also
Username password accept empty value
Take user name valid Password field display Validation
Take User Name Empty Password field valid display validation
username password field invalid like accepted
User Name Password Fields accept invalid detail like accepted
password accept character
Username password field accept valid data like character

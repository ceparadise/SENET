A product roadmap visual summary map vision direction product offering time
A product roadmap communicates behind building
It guiding strategic document well plan executing strategy
Ideally roadmap convey strategic direction product
And also tie back strategy company
Within framework course general order building
The product roadmap several ultimate goal Clearly articulating product vision strategy make easier secure executive ensure everyone working toward common goal
Note roadmaps limited product
These objective similar type roadmaps IT roadmaps
Before prevalence agile development method product roadmap underwent much le fluctuation product lifetime
In fact depending organization roadmap timeframe might locked month longer
In age agile development however roadmap become much living document far shorter timeframes frequent adjustment accommodate changing priority market opportunity
Before set build roadmap need identify audience tailor content focus presentation need
In roadmap example want emphasize product vision focus alignment business goal
With roadmap engineer however want focus specific feature
Here four example roadmap constituency primary function roadmap serf
For audience executive stakeholder larger leadership team aim secure product vision maintain support enthusiasm throughout development cycle
These roadmaps focus therefore strategic concept driving growth new market penetration customer satisfaction market position
These roadmaps often focus feature release sprint milestone
They typically granular scope shorter duration roadmaps
For using agile development method roadmaps often epic feature level
However product goal theme still component roadmaps
Include much transparency possible engineering roadmaps
Even though developer focused le product vision revenue potential smart practice include relevant milestone requirement department facing developer understand specific deadline requirement
Your sale team want know product help sell focus combination feature customer benefit
Focus product benefit rep directly well user benefit communicate customer prospect
Whenever possible group similar theme sale rep discus prospect
Use caution sharing internal roadmaps Sales
It uncommon sale rep share internal roadmaps customer way closing deal generating interest keeping lead warm
To avoid sale team commit product specific release date good idea exclude release launch date roadmaps share Sales
When designing product roadmap customer prospect focus entirely product benefit
Because external document customer roadmaps visual attractive easy understand
It best practice include release launch date roadmaps
Just sale rep sharing internal roadmap prospect commit team prematurely release date external roadmaps lock risk
Unless certain product availability date smart practice avoid including date roadmap

A match goal specific solution help meet goal
It plan applies new product process emerging technology
Developing roadmap three major us
It help reach consensus set need technology required satisfy need provides mechanism help forecast technology development provides framework help plan coordinate technology development
The technology roadmapping process conduct three phase see figure preliminary activity development roadmap activity phase
Because process big one model phase modeled separately
In model different role made everything done group
The first phase preliminary phase see figure consists step In phase key decision maker must identify problem technology roadmapping help solving problem
In step must become clear condition must identified met take action meet
These condition include example All condition satisfied party take necessary action continue next step
The participant zero condition
It applies condition attribute met
Committed leadership needed time effort involved creating technology roadmap
Additionally come one participant one provides leadership sponsorship
This mean line organization must drive process use roadmap make decision
In step context roadmap specified
In company exist must clear roadmap support vision
If vision exist one developed clearly stated
When done boundary roadmap specified
Furthermore level detail set
The scope divided technology scope participation scope
In table different preliminary activity phase seen
All concept end product marked
These concept actual adjusted
The second phase development technology roadmap phase see figure
consists step
Identify product focus roadmap
Identify critical system requirement target
Specify major technology area
Specify technology driver target
Identify technology alternative timeline
Recommend technology alternative pursued In step common product need identified agreed participant
This important get acceptance group process
In case uncertainty product need used determine common product need
In figure participant possibly planning provide common product need
Once decided must roadmapped critical identified provide overall framework technology roadmap
The requirement target attribute figure like reliability cost
These area help achieve critical system requirement
For technology area several found
Example technology area market assessment crosscutting technology component development system development
In step critical system requirement second step transformed technology driver target specific technology area
These driver critical variable select technology alternative
Drivers depend technology area relate technology address critical system requirement
At point technology driver target specified technology alternative satisfy target specified
For alternative timeline estimated mature respect technology driver target
The time factor adapted suitable particular situation
The time horizon related sector usually short
Other distinction made scale interval
Because alternative may differ cost timeline selection must made alternative
These alternative pursue figure
In step lot must made different alternative different target example performance cost even target target
At point technology roadmap finished
In figure seen technology roadmap report consists part The report also include additional information
In table different development phase seen
This moment roadmap must critiqued validated hopefully accepted group involved implementation
This requires plan developed using technology roadmap
Next must periodical review update point need participant technology evolve
Given potential complexity organisational inertia surrounding creation roadmaps researcher University Cambridge focused developing approach roadmapping
This approach called created late primarily help organisation take first step roadmapping minimal resource time commitment
It influential propagation uptake roadmapping internationally including translation workbook Chinese traditional modern German Japanese Spanish
The approach well counterpart innovation strategy roadmapping flexible scalable therefore easily customised efficient application
The process technology roadmapping fit corporate technology planning context
Three critical element connected need product technology
Creating technology roadmap requires certain knowledge skill
Some participant must know purpose technology roadmapping
Next interpersonal skill required since process includes lot discussion finding common need
If number participant really large might need facilitator
This common type technology roadmap linking insertion technology product
This type directed implementation strategy related project planning
Figure show relationship technology development phase programme phase milestone

The purpose product roadmap communicate direction progress internal team external stakeholder
It show initiative planned step get
It include every feature product backlog list specific engineering bug
The roadmap product management document live separately
Creating product roadmap continuous process throughout lifecycle product
Requirements feature generated lot folk including customer partner sale support management engineering operation product management
It team determine priority make sure roadmap aligned business goal
A product roadmap plan match business goal specific technology solution help meet goal
Roadmapping exercise building product roadmap
Roadmaps apply new product service existing offering
Roadmaps created different way showcase different information including To build product roadmap must know key business goal initiative going invest get
Then decide feature best aligned goal
This mean need objective methodology
Here step determine feature add roadmap based biggest impact business Product manager must establish approach true north product headed
This vision defines outlook product headed team build
And amazing vision customer mind
A strong supported detail customer customer need plan
It capture essence want achieve crucial information team must understand develop maintain winning product
Select feature highlight choose whether present internal external data
The external release date different internal release date
It also rounded broader timeframe le precise
show release quarter
For customer view show theme release key feature interested
Internal stakeholder want understand strategic importance conveyed goal initiative
You also create view specific customer allowing audience see roadmaps relevant specific business objective
As likely attended many meeting everyone argued customer request get prioritized
Customer request always ranked strategy
Scoring idea take subjectivity customer request
Each product unique scorecard comprised metric reflect strategy make sense feature level
You fully customize metric scale weighting complexity used add quantification feature
Build scorecard relation product vision
This ensures scorecard reflects matter product line business
Once create implement Scorecard objective way roadmap

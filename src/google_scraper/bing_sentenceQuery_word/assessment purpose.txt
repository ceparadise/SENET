Created GLOSSARY OF EDUCATION REFORM comprehensive online resource describes widely used term concept strategy journalist parent community member
In education term refers wide variety method tool educator use evaluate measure document academic readiness learning progress skill acquisition educational need student
While assessment often equated traditional developed testing company administered large population use diverse array assessment tool method measure everything readiness kindergarten student comprehension advanced physic
Just academic lesson different function assessment typically designed measure specific element level knowledge student already concept skill teacher planning teach ability comprehend analyze different type text reading
Assessments also used identify individual student weakness strength educator provide specialized educational programming social service
In addition assessment developed wide array group individual including teacher district administrator university private company state department education group include combination individual institution
While assessment take wide variety form education following description provide representative overview major form educational assessment
Assessments used wide variety purpose school Formative assessment commonly said learning educator use result modify improve teaching technique instructional period summative assessment said learning evaluate academic achievement conclusion instructional period
Or assessment expert Paul Black put When cook taste soup formative assessment
When customer taste soup summative Assessments also designed variety way different purpose The purpose assessment generally drive way designed many way assessment used
A standardized assessment assessment example form assessment standardized test
A portfolio student work used formative summative form assessment
assessment may also created team teacher commonly used single course grade level school assessment almost never Screening assessment may produced university conducted research specific area child development skill attribute student entering kindergarten increase likelihood successful pattern behavior strength challenge suggest child particular learning disability
In short assessment usually created highly specialized purpose
While educational assessment test around since day schoolhouse increasingly assumed central role effort improve effectiveness public school teaching
score example arguably dominant measure educational achievement United States also commonly reported indicator school teacher performance
As school become increasingly equipped computer tablet wireless internet access growing proportion assessment administered school either online test assessment still common widely used school
New technology software application also changing nature use assessment innumerable way given system typically offer array feature traditional test assignment
For example system may allow student log take assessment time may make performance result available student teacher immediately assessment completed historically might taken hour day week teacher review score grade assessment class
In addition digital online assessment typically include feature analytics give educator detailed information student performance
For example teacher may able see long took student answer particular question many time student failed answer question correctly getting right answer
Many advocate digital online assessment tend argue system used properly could help teacher many digital online system provide far detailed information academic performance student educator use information modify educational program instructional approach way address distinct learning need interest aspiration cultural background individual student
In addition many standardized test administered online though state typically allow student take test computer unavailable student prefer option student technological skill literacy required perform well online assessment
Given assessment come many form serve many diverse function thorough discussion purpose use assessment could fill lengthy book
The following description however provide brief illustrative overview major way assessment used attempt improve school teaching In education widespread agreement assessment integral part effective educational system program
Educators parent elected official policy maker employer public want know whether student learning successfully progressing academically school
The complex wide ranging frequently center assessment used including frequently administered whether assessment beneficial harmful student teaching process

Narrator The burgeoning realm game simulation become industry
Employing technology many world best mind creating product bedazzle engage player age everything killing bad guy performing surgery
Narrator If tilt skull little bit see others Douglas There little doubt anyone mind putting people environment experience thing need learn make mistake without risk try new thing
The engagement come type environment better way learn sitting classroom throwing information
Narrator Clients Military spend million train personnel simulated environment like virtual residency called Pulse
Douglas The first version Pulse built model Bethesda Naval Medical Intensive Care Unit
You work care giver doctor nurse see thing would seeing real world
You shine light pupil based physiological condition patient eye dilate appropriately
You check ear touch feel listen virtual world diagnosis want replicate real experience doctor nurse would real world
Narrator These day engaging simulation game found anywhere critical thinking happens
Anywhere except classroom
Teacher X
Kurt Our school trouble response thing like cellphone new technology ban say Well ca bring school
And game I think really cutting edge probably anything good letting people start novice become expert
Student See
Student Oh yeah
David We live industrial economy anymore
We live knowledge economy think education fundamentally different way
We ca focusing basic fact basic skill
We think way thinking going matter traditional school right
Kurt On Wii
Narrator Kurt Squire David Williamson Shaffer research educational game University Wisconsin
In one study Squire gauged impact game Civilization group fourth fifth sixth grader
Kurt A lot kid come hating school particular really hating social study
And start playing game fun seeing ca get involved game
It really quite complex
There lot historical vocabulary lot map lot terminology
They start think model simulation history think
So start thinking technology geography influence way civilization grow fade
From find usually start producing game work gone straight A social study area
And year old kid
If look one biggest crisis right school underachieving boy become labeled
starting social problem fighting
And teacher really running What kid
And think game really powerful way tap interest channel towards something positive
The kid certainly love
Teacher It already
We got two hour work exam
What I want try version Donkey Kong animation
Narrator McKinley Technology High School Washington embraced brave new virtual world
Teacher Any question
Narrator Plagued declining enrollment campus violence school shut reopened six year later tech magnet latest hardware revamped curriculum focusing biotechnology digital medium
Teacher And actually controlling camera good
Switch looking camera
Daniel We want student consumer simulation technology designer simulation technology determining structure story told
For one able creative personalize
Student You need move camera
Student I saying locked
Student But still need move camera
Daniel By enabling technical skill able express individualization creative skill
Ciarra Basically I I made stadium stage chair everything
Even though see whole bunch chair around actually take long
That actually easiest part
Daniel By bringing student technology together able insure kid see connection beyond standard written text math problem see math feed videogame design algebra physic geometry part must considered trying design engaging interactive experience
Student So basically American Red Cross Fire Safety game couple student McKinley created summer
We spent six week
There three four different room bedroom bathroom family room
The purpose game go ass fire hazard
And happens see hazard click zoom give little excerpt fire hazard like Do overload plug thing like
Ciarra Just energy McKinley different
It make want learn
They teach u programming animation modeling Maya thing like really exciting
Narrator McKinley student also asked test game simulation like virtual lab developed distributed free Howard Hughes Medical Institute
Dennis There question virtual lab example Bacterial
lab involves obtaining
sequence using identify unknown microbe
That kind experiment hard high school setting allow teacher expose student thing would able otherwise
The thing animation medium good revealing hidden world simply tangible people way tell people exciting interesting always better show
Eitan And actually body deal sort bacterial infection clear know minus really cool graphic
Narrator Another game McKinley student helped incubate Immune Attack multimillion dollar project underwritten Federation American Scientists
Eitan In game reactivate somebody defunct immune system teach cope bacterial viral infection
Student That macrophage
Etian Yep macrophage right
Every month new build interested getting feedback student work
What complicated
What clear
How improve game
And recently taken two McKinley high school senior intern FAS actually helping develop game mutually beneficial relationship working McKinley High School
Narrator Whether debugging simulation scientist test driving latest commercial game kid seem task
And little guidance become expert designer
Eric What guy
Ben Again knock back roll
Eric Okay
Narrator When cancer patient Ben Duskin approached Foundation unusual request
Eric His wish make video game player fight cancer cell could send back kid still treatment center
This finished chemo
And Ben position know uniquely would help primary motive distract entertain
Narrator Enlisting aid Software Engineer Eric Johnston Ben designed game engaging enlightening
Eric One thing I think fantastic idea Ben take side effect cancer cell side effect represented game monster monster one
So giant chicken chicken pox robot fling barf vomit monster
By making monster large attack grow smaller smaller le scary part making game engaging
Right got billiard ball shooting u
For parent sibling really provided look kid point view treatment process look
Ben Whoa
Eric Oh yeah I added
David We technology help kid learn new way essentially build model education future might look like
And hope parent teacher school board member kid politician u look happens environment say Wow ca school like
Teacher You going three choice want work class
Narrator Seeing potential transform public education Federation American Scientists called major federal effort fund serious game
Henry The potential huge seems national shame putting money table find right
I mean payoff spectacular
You think using technology could actually completely turn productivity education get people otherwise uninterested underserved system fully engaged ca afford leave anybody behind
Student Land like geography
Student That geography
Douglas I think advance technology day going allow gaming simulation community create simulation anything deploy Internet every desktop best teacher world available every student
Kurt Good game really compelling player point people worried addiction thing
And know ironic imagine world addiction school
You know someone would walk say I addicted learning I need
Students Whoo

Not time spend video game I amazed simulation extent game teach thing
Even though I familiar video game I totally agree understand overload much information one time
Students get frustrated overload new information
The video simulated video game I found facinating fact student encouraged design game test game even intern huge corporation incredible
The fact game tapped student interest able channel positively excited learning encouraging
Both book video discussed motivation game
The video really proved game leisure entertainment motivate learning
It exciting
There lot point video I agree also went along book
Both mentioned game involve critical thinking skill important
Many thing world use skill something hard teach child
So making interesting engaging game help
The video book also mention game simulation good seeing thing tangible
I feel one thing make game interesting
Being able go world difficult experience great
There one point book made stronger argument still enough evidence prove game simulation help improve learning
From video made seem game really help learning way future
But research book provided seems like many factor making game great teachable
I agree David
You make really good point use simulation purpose video
It seems like great program McKinley interesting look inside technology high school
Where high school fit
Kurt Squire mentioned use game Civilization led student understanding technology geography influence way civilization grows
But research Clark Mayer reviewed written I wonder student actually made connection really learned They learned play game
I say I also little worried David Williamson saying ca focusing basic fact basic skill
I would impressed simulation learning student could say geography influence growth civilization could find China map Asia
This video helpful
As teacher must latesr technology
David I reading comment response little late way
I agree much interest learning getting around simulation screen learning real world knowledge
However benefit virtual reality
I experienced fifth teen year ago multiplex theater virtual equipment brought put head gear blown away feeling alternate reality arm lifted felt like arm wow
What I cant understand known technology used education
The use could like going inside classic book experience everything character would experience field music band Beetles symphonic orchestra could play along musician take solo jazz band real virtual time
Paulette The greatest problem public school education still teaching first half century
All new technology barely entered school system student left behing Japanese Korean student taught computer kindergarten
Will create probems
Of course mean give student opportunity learn create solve problem technology create
School administrator embrassed technology visionary year ago started taking
Certainly public school
Public school failure come bad teacher bad kid come lack vision innovation
Ida Lanza San Pedro HS LAUSD California left behind kindergarten embraced I need spell check I post
If like video start collaborating educator experiment gaming classroom
Join conversation
Hope see
I agree game like Civilization Sim City used teach student thing like Civics History

systematic process using empirical data refine program improve student learning
Assessment data obtained directly examining student work ass achievement learning outcome based data one make inference learning
Assessment often used interchangeably test limited test
Assessment focus individual learner learning community class workshop organized group learner course academic program institution educational system whole also known
The word came use educational context Second World War
As continuous process assessment establishes measurable clear student learning outcome learning provisioning sufficient amount learning opportunity achieve outcome implementing systematic way gathering analyzing interpreting evidence determine well student learning match expectation using collected information inform improvement student learning
The final purpose assessment practice education depends practitioner researcher assumption belief nature human mind origin knowledge process learning
The term generally used refer activity teacher use help student learn gauge student progress
Assessment divided sake convenience using following categorization Assessment often divided initial formative summative category purpose considering different objective assessment practice
Jay McTighe Ken proposed seven practice effective learning
One showing criterion evaluation test
Another importance know skill level student giving instruction
Giving lot feedback encouraging practice
Educational researcher Robert Stake explains difference formative summative assessment following analogy When cook taste soup formative
When guest taste soup summative
Summative formative assessment often referred learning context respectively
Assessment learning generally summative nature intended measure learning outcome report outcome student parent administrator
Assessment learning generally occurs conclusion class course semester academic year
Assessment learning generally formative nature used teacher consider approach teaching next step individual learner class
A common form formative assessment
Diagnostic assessment measure student current knowledge skill purpose identifying suitable program learning
form diagnostic assessment involves student assessing
asks assessed consider hypothetical future situation
similar summative assessment focus achievement
It often aligned movement
Though ideally significantly different traditional multiple choice test commonly associated use response standard question scored human scorer scale meeting falling exceeding performance standard rather ranked curve
A task identified student asked create produce something often setting involve application knowledge skill
Proficiency demonstrated providing extended response
Performance format differentiated product performance
The performance may result product painting portfolio paper exhibition may consist performance speech athletic skill musical recital reading
Assessment either summative formative often categorized either objective subjective
Objective assessment form questioning single correct answer
Subjective assessment form questioning may one correct answer one way expressing correct answer
There various type objective subjective question
Objective question type include answer matching question
Subjective question include question essay
Objective assessment well suited increasingly popular computerized format
Some argued distinction objective subjective assessment neither useful accurate reality thing objective assessment
In fact assessment created inherent bias built decision relevant subject matter content well cultural class ethnic gender bias
Test result compared established criterion performance student previous performance Assessment either
Formal assessment usually implies written document test quiz paper
A formal assessment given numerical score grade based student performance whereas informal assessment contribute student final grade
An informal assessment usually occurs casual manner may include observation inventory checklist rating scale performance portfolio assessment participation peer discussion
Internal assessment set marked school
teacher
Students get mark feedback regarding assessment
External assessment set governing body marked personnel
Some external assessment give much limited feedback marking
However test Australia NAPLAN criterion addressed student given detailed feedback order teacher address compare student learning achievement also plan future
In general assessment considered high level
Approaches reliability validity vary however
relates consistency assessment
A reliable assessment one consistently achieves result similar cohort student
Various factor affect ambiguous question many option within question paper vague marking instruction poorly trained marker
Traditionally reliability assessment based following The reliability measurement x also defined quantitatively reliability observed test score x variability true candidate innate performance measured test score respectively
range completely unreliable completely reliable
assessment one measure intended measure
For example would valid ass driving skill written test alone
A valid way assessing driving skill would combination test help determine driver know written test driving knowledge driver able performance assessment actual driving
Teachers frequently complain examination properly ass upon examination based effectively questioning validity exam
Validity assessment generally gauged examination evidence following category A good assessment validity reliability plus quality attribute noted specific context purpose
In practice assessment rarely totally valid totally reliable
A ruler marked wrongly always give wrong measurement
It reliable valid
Asking random individual tell time without looking clock watch sometimes used example assessment valid reliable
The answer vary individual average answer probably close actual time
In many field medical research educational testing psychology often reliability validity
A history test written high validity many essay question
It good measure mastery subject difficult score completely accurately
A history test written high reliability entirely multiple choice
It good measuring knowledge history easily scored great precision
We may generalize
The reliable estimate purport measure le certain actually measuring aspect attainment
It well distinguish validity predictive validity
The former used widely education predicts score student would get similar test different question
The latter used widely workplace predicts performance
Thus test knowledge driving rule appropriate predictively valid test would ass whether potential driver could follow rule
In field particular published three set standard evaluation
The Personnel Evaluation Standards published edition published published
Each publication present elaborates set standard use variety educational setting
The standard provide guideline designing implementing assessing improving identified form evaluation
Each standard placed one four fundamental category promote educational evaluation proper useful feasible accurate
In set standard validity reliability consideration covered accuracy topic
For example student accuracy standard help ensure student evaluation provide sound accurate credible information student learning performance
The following table summarizes main behind almost theoretical research work instructional practice education one course practice assessment
These different framework given rise interesting debate among scholar
epistemology Concerns best apply assessment practice across public school system largely focused question use testing standardized test often used gauge student progress teacher quality statewide educational success
For researcher practitioner question whether test administered general consensus administered useful way test offer useful information student progress curriculum implementation well offering formative us learner
The real issue whether testing practice currently implemented provide service educator student
In mandate standardized testing nationwide
These test align state curriculum link teacher student district state accountability result test
Proponents NCLB argue offer tangible method gauging educational success holding teacher school accountable failing score closing across class ethnicity
Opponents standardized testing dispute claim arguing holding educator accountable test result lead practice
Additionally many argue focus standardized testing encourages teacher equip student narrow set skill enhance test performance without actually fostering deeper understanding subject matter key principle within knowledge domain
The assessment caused controversy use used deny diploma student attended high school four year demonstrate learned required material writing exam
Opponents say student put four year denied high school diploma merely repeatedly failing test even knowing required material
test blamed causing sickness student teacher teacher choosing narrow curriculum towards teacher belief tested
In exercise designed make child comfortable testing newspaper published picture feed fear
The published image purportedly response student asked draw picture thought state assessment
Other critic Washington State University question use test item far beyond standard cognitive level student age
Compared portfolio assessment simple test much le expensive le prone disagreement scorer scored quickly enough returned end school year
student take test condition often use test reason
Orlich criticizes use expensive holistically graded test rather inexpensive bubble test measure quality system individual large number student
Other prominent critic testing include
The use banned state educational decision rank student best worst criticized bias minority
Most education official support individual student score depends solely whether answered question correctly regardless whether neighbor better worse making decision
It widely noted emergence technology mindset learning increasingly collaborative knowledge increasingly distributed across many member learning community
Traditional assessment practice however focus large part individual fail account learning context
As researcher field assessment consider cultural shift arise emergence need find new method applying assessment learner
democratic education school perform offer assessment evaluation transcript recommendation asserting rate people school judge comparing student standard set violation student
Students decide measure progress learner process real lifelong learning proper educational assessment century adduce
According Sudbury school policy cause harm student move life outside school
However admit make process difficult hardship part student learning make way set standard meet goal
The policy help create atmosphere free competition among student battle adult approval encourages positive cooperative environment amongst student body
The final stage Sudbury education student choose take graduation thesis
Each student writes topic prepared adulthood entering community large
This thesis submitted Assembly review
The final stage thesis process oral defense given student open floor question challenge comment Assembly member
At end Assembly vote secret ballot whether award diploma
A major concern use educational assessment overall validity accuracy fairness come assessing English language learner ELL
The majority assessment within United States normative standard based culture adequately represent ELL population
Consequently would many case inaccurate inappropriate draw conclusion ELL student normative score
Research show majority school appropriately modify assessment order accommodate student unique cultural background
This resulted ELL student special education causing disproportionately represented special education program
Although may see inappropriate placement special education supportive helpful research shown inappropriately placed student actually regressed progress
It often necessary utilize service translator order administer assessment ELL student native language however several issue translating assessment item
One issue translation frequently suggest correct expected response changing difficulty assessment item
Additionally translation assessment item sometimes distort original meaning item
Finally many translator qualified properly trained work ELL student assessment situation
All factor compromise validity fairness assessment making result reliable
Nonverbal assessment shown le discriminatory ELL student however still present cultural bias within assessment item
When considering ELL student special education assessment team integrate interpret information collected order ensure non biased conclusion
The decision based multidimensional source data including teacher parent interview well classroom observation
Decisions take student unique cultural linguistic experiential background consideration strictly based assessment result

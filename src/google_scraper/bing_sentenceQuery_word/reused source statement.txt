In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

We intend book introduction computer science focus creating problem solution C programming language
We jump quickly
You get lost detail miss idea much larger breadth computer science
Computer Science study practice information processing
This take many form
Many form appear electronic computer information processing take place many context In early day electronic computer information largely numerical calculating mathematical function
Later analyzing textual information become much important instance What tell severity current flu outbreak analyzing phrasing Google search
Images analyzed What satellite image tell distribution drought
Sounds convert verbal speech accurately written sentence
DNA hold information body process protein
Our brain chemical electronic signal process information
There rich interplay cognitive scientist computer scientist modeling problem solving brain computer sometimes better understand brain sometimes better solve problem electronic computer
Economic system becoming better understood term flow information
The computation processing familiar computer gene brain chemical whole society economy adapts
Algorithms heart traditional problem solving
An clearly expressed sequence step leading result finite amount time
A recipe baking pound cake algorithm
Such algorithm useful concept use later computer programming A named recipe may include instruction Beat The recipe probably say name simpler sequence step algorithm like Parameters The egg beating instruction work general number egg
To use instruction pound cake must supply specific value use make general instruction become clear
The pound cake recipe us egg beating instruction us number actual data
Repetition The instruction cracking egg repeatedly every egg
The instruction stated told long go egg step
Step say stop repeating step
A recipe represents data word get processed human reader
Machines used different representation
One earliest adding machine Pascaline represented number angle rotation interlocked gear
An abacus us position group sliding bead represent digit
The Jacquard loom used card row hole punched indicating warp thread raised lowered cross thread woven
In modern electronic computer basic bit data actually called held switch often form higher voltage grounded state
The symbolic representation often
This symbolism come representation integer also called It place value system place numeral represents power two binary viewed decimal system
Computer hardware handle limited number bit time memory space limited usually integer stored limited space like bit
We illustrate smallest bit called
Since bit two possible state bit possible state
Directly considered binary numeral represent
We also want represent negative number half available code
An signed integer notation represents unsigned number
These code leading
A negative number range represented would unsigned notation
These code leading
For example represented like unsigned binary
Limited precision approximation real number stored something like scientific notation except binary roughly sign mantissa exponent Both e fixed number bit limited option mantissa restricts number limited option exponent restricts
Data limit different sized numeric code
Once number sort kind data encoded Characters like keyboard numerical code associated one
For example unicode letter A
Images often represented sequence colored pixel
Since human eye sensitive three specific color red green blue pixel represented numerical intensity three color
Besides data instruction need representation agent interpret
In earliest electronic computer switch relay later vacuum tube machine new set needed
It great advance instruction also became symbolic represented binary code computer could recognize act
This code called
With machine language instruction became form data could stored computer memory
We distinguish program run stored program
The hardware determines form capacity machine language machine different hardware architecture likely distinct machine language
Biologists fair idea protein sequence data encoded DNA still working DNA instruction encoded controlling protein made
In book writing instruction shown sequence
Some earliest program help programmer work tool early one program took easier understand instruction automatically translated machine language
An example assembler instruction would like move value storage location identified name X
Machine instruction elementary programming still tedious code could reused machine different architecture
The next big step past assembler advent language instruction like normal mathematical English expression
Examples Fortran Cobol
A Fortran statement calculating slope like might require seven machine code instruction
To use Fortran program required three step write onto punch card originally compile machine code execute machine code
The compiler would still architecture specific compiler architecture would need written number program could compiled run
A later variant executing language
An interpreter translates language machine code immediately executes storing machine code later use every time statement code executed translation need redone
Interpreters also
Some later language like Java C use hybrid approach A compiler run machine work translating language program language called
This machine language real machine bytecode simple enough writing interpreter easy
Again interpreter bytecode must
In approach Program source COMPILER bytecode INTERPRETER execution The easiest way check understanding small new piece C write highly specified small program sure test new idea
That totally unlike real world programming
Here realistic sequence Note important part process centered coding communicating clearly possibly client
Communication skill critical
Most introduction far key concept underlie basic programming
Most part far electronic computer could written decade ago
Much emerged since We conclude brief discussion organizing principle computer science
How design hardware software system
What new programming language expressive lead fewer error useful proving major program never make mistake
Errors program controlling machine delivering radiation cancer treatment error led patient death
Hardware change evolutionary revolutionary Instead electric circuit use light quantum particle DNA
A detailed discussion principle breadth importance computer science found
For alternate general introduction programming context C particular another free online source Rob Miles C Yellow Book available
Note written specifically Microsoft Windows use using Visual Studio software development environment work Windows machine cost lot student
The introduce alternative Microsoft environment Xamarin Studio Mono free software project make C available multiple platform Windows Mac Linux machine
With substantial fraction student machine run Windows flexibility important

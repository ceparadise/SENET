The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution

Harvard student developer
This post meant help computer science undergraduate looking software engineering internship summer
Applying internship daunting post hopefully address commonly asked question I see Reddit
Along miscellanea regarding application post cover two thing I last summer summer first time seriously looking internship
From beginning September beginning January around week I lot interviewing technical interview four recruiter interview two coding challenge one product manager interview one trader interview involuntarily moved software engineering
One reason I many interview I poorly many interview first month
Despite read interviewing internet I wish I known prepare
Finally note I mostly interviewed medium large company Silicon Valley mileage may vary local company smaller startup
Out respect company I interviewed I linking specific company specific interview question
I would categorize internship interview falling one three category I explain depth adding detail prepare category
Note every interview fall precisely one three category interview mix multiple category
The common type interview especially interviewing specific team
This people envision computer science interview asked one programming question implement solution collaborative editor like
I would divide interview two topic I think first category easier includes question like
Even immediately know answer chance figure without requiring knowledge specific algorithm data structure
I find second category trickier sometimes question hard near impossible know specific data structure algorithm
For example never done tree traversal asked question I received two different company question much harder
In one interview I poorly delved deeply variation hash table I familiar basic linked list hash table
At end every question almost always asked discus complexity implementation
Here I realize first instead walking
Unless algorithmic challenge regular basis worth time read practice
I would take book like grain salt
Except big company like Facebook interview question internship generally much easier senior developer
You asked write tree scratch
From experience list comprehensively cover topic interview experience suggestion welcome
search DFS BFS respectively extremely popular I would estimate
Know
The pleasant conversation interviewer get opportunity talk resume project
I found type interview common small medium sized company
Empirically I better interview algorithmic interview opportunity pitch passionate developer
I usually talked research past internship experience
Note I junior third year undergraduate student
If freshman sophomore panic lot talk yet
Without sideprojects past internship however interview tough
You use course project I think people know course project file hacked together day varies school course
Be prepared talk job project resume
For project want ready answer question What project
What scope project
much time big What role project
What learn
What challenge project
If prepare answer ready answer general question frequently show interview Tell technical challenge
The interview test knowledge specific language claim know resume
This interview often show placed interview specific team iOS Safari team Apple YUI team Yahoo
I never asked coding question interview interviewer expected show knowledge answer quiz question discussion relevant project opinion language feature
If placed interview team us specific language framework prepare following question
I asked multiple occasion What make language different language
If change something language would change
Tell technical challenge working project language
In addition question I also asked following question three different occasion internship Tell closure JavaScript
I usually answered explanation callback function scope JavaScript
Closures allow traditional programming object closure
One question I asked interview recite value various context mean fair game
Again every interview fall one three category
I encountered couple weird interview style Some bigger company dive straight technical part interview interviewer ask important question variant prepare Tell
Keep succinct
I would say minute long
Hit important point interest experience spare interviewer life story
I saying I made mistake long pitch first interview I could tell interviewer ended getting bored
Even interview run allocated time interviewer ask Do question
I used lot trouble I started treating opportunity conversation became much easier
This chance connect personal level interviewer
If performance borderline insightful conversation interviewer hurt
If interviewer described yet first thing I asked Can tell
I let conversation flow
If much follow I ask test product choose target new feature
There Programmers Stack Exchange although suitable potential intern ask
These answer question either I asking beginning application process I see frequently asked
Most answer
How long resume
For company based US resume longer one page
Personally I like reading resume longer one page
From I read various recruiter manager internet either although mean automatic rejection
Make sure resume look professional spacing font structure
Use serif font
If resume long consider cutting part tech related club extracurriculars experience different field
Finally include thing like high school GPA matter people reading resume
When I start applying
Most internship application started popping October November
I think hurt apply earlier although one friend told intern candidate company usually fared better spring fall
Before last summer I already decided research I receive email interview late March
If jump October panic
How important sideprojects
It depends company freshman first year sophomore second year important
When I applied first internship freshman spring recruiter emailed back saying manager wanted know I sideprojects
In addition spicing resume give something substantive talk done interview
How long take hear back interview
It varies company
From small medium sized company I heard back anywhere day week
Without exception final round interview took every big company two week month respond either offer rejection
How I overcome nervousness interview
In algorithmic interview I started poorly I would freeze ramble especially I slept much previous night schoolwork
Eventually interviewer would pretty much tell answer almost always led rejection interview
If happens advice tell interviewer Let consolidate thought Take deep breath think anything tackle question
If feel nervous beginning try persuade friendly conversation
How I know well interview went
In experience interviewer start talking much responsibility intern explicitly ask interview probably went well
This guarantee mean
I read thing internet asking interviewer felt interview went
I tried feel free let know
I think would useful source feedback
Hope help

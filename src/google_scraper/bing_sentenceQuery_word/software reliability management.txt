Computer system need reliable
Backing testing redundancy disaster recovery plan help improve system reliability
Computers found almost anywhere usually handling data quickly efficiently fewer error done task manually
However lot thing go wrong computer system Reliability major concern company
There serious consequence including Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

Reliability play key role system
Reliability engineering deal estimation prevention management high level lifetime engineering failure
Although parameter define affect reliability reliability solely achieved mathematics statistic
You really find root cause needed effectively prevent failure looking statistic
Nearly teaching literature subject emphasize aspect ignore reality range uncertainty involved largely invalidate quantitative method prediction measurement
Reliability engineering relates closely use common method analysis may require input
Reliability engineering focus cost failure caused system downtime cost spare repair equipment personnel cost warranty claim
Safety engineering normally focus preserving life nature cost therefore deal particularly dangerous mode
High reliability level also result good engineering attention detail almost never reactive failure management using reliability accounting statistic
The word traced back first attested poet
Before World War II term linked mostly test type science considered reliable result would obtained repeatedly
In product improvement use promoted around time working statistical model fatigue
The development reliability engineering parallel path quality
The modern use word reliability defined military characterizing product would operate expected specified period time
In World War II many reliability issue due inherent unreliability electronic equipment available time fatigue issue
In
Miner published seminal paper titled Cumulative Damage Fatigue ASME journal
A main application reliability engineering military vacuum tube used radar system electronics reliability proved problematic costly
The IEEE formed Reliability Society
In formed group called Advisory Group Reliability Electronic Equipment AGREE investigate reliability method military equipment
This group recommended following main way working In emphasis given reliability testing component system level
The famous military standard created time
Around period also also military handbook published RCA Radio Corporation America used prediction failure rate component
The emphasis component reliability empirical research
Mil Std alone slowly decrease
More pragmatic approach used consumer industry used
In television increasingly made semiconductor
Automobiles rapidly increased use semiconductor variety microcomputer hood dash
Large air conditioning system developed electronic controller microwave oven variety appliance
Communications system began adopt electronics replace older mechanical switching system
Bellcore issued first consumer prediction methodology telecommunication SAE developed similar document automotive application
The nature prediction evolved decade became apparent die complexity factor determined failure rate Integrated Circuits ICs
Kam Wong published paper questioning bathtub curve also
During decade failure rate many component dropped factor
Software became important reliability system
By pace IC development picking
Wider use microcomputer common PC market helped keep IC density following Moore law doubling every month
Reliability engineering changing towards understanding
Failure rate component kept dropping issue became prominent
became important
For software CCM model Capability Maturity Model developed gave qualitative approach reliability
ISO added reliability measure part design development portion Certification
The expansion Web created new challenge security trust
The older problem little reliability information available replaced much information questionable value
Consumer reliability problem could data discussed online real time
New technology system MEMS handheld GPS device combined cell phone computer represent challenge maintain reliability
Product development time continued shorten decade done three year done month
This meant reliability tool task must closely tied development process
In many way reliability became part everyday life consumer expectation
The objective reliability engineering decreasing order priority The reason priority emphasis far effective way working term minimizing cost generating reliable product
The primary skill required therefore ability understand anticipate possible cause failure knowledge prevent
It also necessary knowledge method used analysing design data
Reliability engineering requires different elaborate system approach system
Reliability engineering may case involve Effective reliability engineering requires understanding basic experience broad engineering skill good knowledge many different special field engineering example Reliability may defined following way Many engineering technique used reliability reliability FMEA FTA probabilistic load material stress wear calculation probabilistic fatigue creep analysis human error analysis manufacturing defect analysis reliability testing etc
It crucial analysis done properly much attention detail effective
Because large number reliability technique expense varying degree reliability required different situation project develop reliability program plan specify reliability task SoW requirement performed specific system
Consistent creation example goal reliability assessment provide robust set qualitative quantitative evidence use component system associated unacceptable risk
The basic step take combination probability severity failure incident scenario occurring
In definition severity failure include cost spare part logistics damage secondary failure downtime machine may cause production loss
A complete definition failure also mean injury dismemberment death people within system witness mine accident industrial accident space shuttle failure innocent bystander witness citizenry city like Bhopal Love Canal Chernobyl Sendai victim Tōhoku earthquake tsunami case reliability engineering becomes system safety
What acceptable determined managing authority customer affected community
Residual risk risk left reliability activity finished includes therefore completely quantifiable
The complexity technical system Improvements Design Materials Planned Inspections design Backup Redundancy decrease risk increase cost
The risk decreased ALARA low reasonably achievable ALAPA low practically achievable level
Implementing reliability program simply software purchase checklist item must completed ensure reliable product process
A reliability program complex learning system unique product process
It supported leadership built skill develop within team integrated business process executed following proven standard work practice
A reliability program plan used document exactly best practice task method tool analysis test required particular sub system well clarify customer requirement reliability assessment
For complex system reliability program plan separate
Resource determination manpower budget testing task critical successful program
In general amount work required effective program complex system large
A reliability program plan essential achieving high level reliability testability resulting system developed early system development refined system
It specifies reliability engineer also task performed
A reliability program plan approved top program Management responsible allocation sufficient resource implementation
A reliability program plan may also used evaluate improve availability system strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier improving reliability
Maintainability estimate repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability calculation prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
When reliability control complicated issue may arise like manpower maintainer customer service capability shortage spare part availability logistic delay lack repair facility extensive complex configuration management cost others
The problem unreliability may increased also due domino effect failure repair
Focusing maintainability therefore enough
If failure prevented none issue importance therefore reliability generally regarded important part availability
Reliability need evaluated improved related availability Total Cost Ownership TCO due cost spare part maintenance transport cost storage cost part obsolete risk etc
But GM Toyota belatedly discovered TCO also includes downstream liability cost reliability calculation sufficiently accurately addressed customer personal bodily risk
Often needed two
There might maximum ratio availability cost ownership
Testability system also addressed plan link reliability maintainability
The maintenance strategy influence reliability system preventive predictive maintenance although never bring inherent reliability
The reliability plan clearly provide strategy availability control
Whether availability also cost ownership important depends use system
For example system critical link production big oil normally allowed high cost ownership cost translates even minor increase availability unavailability platform result massive loss revenue easily exceed high cost ownership
A proper reliability plan always address RAMT analysis total context
RAMT stand Reliability Availability Testability context customer need
For system one first task reliability engineering adequately specify reliability maintainability requirement allocated overall need importantly derived proper design failure analysis preliminary prototype test result
Clear requirement able designed constrain designer designing particular unreliable item construction interface system
Setting availability reliability testability maintainability target max
failure rate appropriate
This broad misunderstanding Reliability Requirements Engineering
Reliability requirement address system including test assessment requirement associated task documentation
Reliability requirement included appropriate system subsystem requirement specification test plan contract statement
Creation proper requirement critical
Provision quantitative minimum target MTBF value failure rate sufficient different reason
One reason full validation related correctness verifiability time quantitative reliability allocation requirement spec lower level complex system often made consequence fact requirement probabilistic extremely high level uncertainty involved showing compliance probabilistic requirement reliability function time accurate estimate probabilistic reliability number per item available late project sometimes even many year use
Compare problem continuous balancing example mass requirement development aircraft already often big undertaking
Notice case mass differ term function time data available already CAD model
In case reliability level unreliability failure rate may change factor decade multiple result minor deviation design process anything else
The information often available without huge uncertainty within development phase
This make allocation problem almost impossible useful practical valid manner result massive
A pragmatic approach therefore example use general level class quantitative requirement depending severity failure effect
Also validation result far subjective task type requirement
Quantitative reliability term far uncertain design parameter design
Furthermore reliability design requirement drive system part design incorporate feature prevent failure occurring limit consequence failure first place
Not would aid prediction effort would keep distracting engineering effort kind accounting work
A design requirement precise enough designer design also analysis requirement achieved possible within stated confidence
Any type reliability requirement detailed could derived failure analysis Stress Fatigue analysis Reliability Hazard Analysis FTA FMEA Human Factor Analysis Functional Hazard Analysis etc
type reliability testing
Also requirement needed verification test required overload stress test time needed
To derive requirement effective manner risk assessment mitigation logic used
Robust hazard log system must created contain detailed information system could failed
Requirements derived tracked way
These practical design requirement shall drive design used verification purpose
These requirement often design constraint way derived failure analysis preliminary test
Understanding difference compared purely quantitative logistic requirement specification Failure Rate MTBF target paramount development successful complex system
The maintainability requirement address cost repair well repair time
Testability confused test requirement requirement provide link reliability maintainability address detectability failure mode particular system level isolation level creation diagnostics procedure
As indicated reliability engineer also address requirement various reliability task documentation system development testing production operation
These requirement generally specified contract statement work depend much leeway customer wish provide contractor
Reliability task include various analysis planning failure reporting
Task selection depends criticality system well cost
A system may require formal failure reporting review process throughout development whereas system may rely final test report
The common reliability program task documented reliability program standard IEEE
Failure reporting analysis corrective action system common approach reliability monitoring
In practice failure traced back type example However human also good detecting failure correcting improvising abnormal situation occur
Thererfore policy completely rule human action design production process improve reliability may effective
Some task better performed human better performed machine
Furthermore human error management organization data information misuse abuse item may also contribute unreliability
This core reason high level reliability complex system achieved following robust process proper planning execution validation verification task
This also includes careful organization data information sharing creating reliability culture way safety culture paramount development safety critical system
Reliability prediction combine Some recognized reliability engineering specialist
Patrick Barnard argued much emphasis often given prediction reliability parameter instead effort devoted prevention failure reliability improvement
Failures prevented first place case
The emphasis quantification target setting
MTBF might imply limit achievable reliability however inherent limit development higher reliability need costly
In addition argue prediction reliability historic data misleading comparison valid identical design product manufacturing process maintenance identical operating load usage environment
Even minor change could major effect reliability
Furthermore unreliable important item
interesting candidate reliability investigation likely modified since historical data gathered making standard statistical method process used
medical insurance industry le effective
Another surprising logical argument able accurately predict reliability testing exact mechanism failure must known therefore case could prevented
Following incorrect route trying quantify solve complex reliability engineering problem term MTBF probability using example approach referred Barnard Playing Numbers Game regarded bad practice
For existing system arguable attempt responsible program correct root cause discovered failure may render initial MTBF estimate invalid new assumption subject high error level effect correction must made
Another practical issue general detailed failure data available often featuring inconsistent filtering failure feedback data ignoring statistical error high rare event like reliability related failure
Very clear guideline must present count compare failure related different type
inherent design failure
Comparing different type cause may lead incorrect estimation incorrect business decision focus improvement
To perform proper quantitative reliability prediction system may difficult expensive done testing
At individual reliability result often obtained comparatively high confidence testing many sample part might possible using available testing budget
However unfortunately test may lack validity due assumption made testing
These author emphasized importance initial testing failure learn failure improve system part
The general conclusion drawn accurate absolute prediction either comparison testing reliability case possible
An exception might failure due problem fatigue failure
In introduction written reliability prediction used great caution used solely comparison study
Design Reliability DfR process encompasses tool procedure ensure product meet reliability requirement use environment duration lifetime
DfR implemented design stage product proactively improve product reliability
DfR often used part overall strategy
Reliability design begin development system
Reliability availability model use provide graphical mean evaluating relationship different part system
These model may incorporate prediction based failure rate taken historical data
While input data prediction often accurate absolute sense valuable ass relative difference design alternative
Maintainability parameter example MTTR also used input model
The important fundamental initiating cause failure mechanism identified analyzed engineering tool
A diverse set practical guidance performance reliability provided designer generate design product protect protected damage excessive wear
Proper validation input load requirement may needed addition verification reliability performance testing
One important design technique
This mean one part system fails alternate success path backup system
The reason ultimate design choice related fact reliability evidence new part system often available extremely expensive obtain
By combining redundancy together high level failure monitoring avoidance common cause failure even system relatively poor part reliability made highly reliable system level mission critical reliability
No testing reliability required
In conjunction redundancy use dissimilar design manufacturing process
via different supplier similar part single independent channel provide le sensitivity quality issue
early childhood failure single supplier allowing level reliability achieved moment development cycle early life
Redundancy also applied system engineering double checking requirement data design calculation software test overcome systematic failure
Another effective way deal reliability issue perform analysis predicts degradation enabling prevention unscheduled downtime event failure
Reliability Centered Maintenance program used
For electronic assembly increasing shift towards different approach called
This technique relies understanding physical static dynamic failure mechanism
It account variation load strength stress lead failure high level detail made possible use modern FEM software program handle complex geometry mechanism creep stress relaxation fatigue probabilistic design Monte Carlo
The material component reduce probability failure make robust variation
Another common design technique component
selecting component whose specification significantly exceed expected stress level using heavier gauge electrical wire might normally specified expected
Many task technique analysis used Reliability Engineering specific particular industry application commonly include Results method presented review part system design logistics
Reliability one requirement among many complex part system
Engineering study used determine balance reliability requirement constraint
Reliability engineer whether using quantitative qualitative method describe failure hazard rely language pinpoint risk enable issue solved
The language used must help create orderly description complex surrounding relates failure
Systems engineering much finding correct word describe problem related risk readily solved via engineering solution
Jack Ring said system engineer job language project
Ring et al

For failure reliability engineer concentrate rather predicting
Understanding failure occurred
due component manufacturing issue far likely lead improvement design process used quantifying failure likely occur
via determining MTBF
To first reliability hazard relating need classified ordered based form qualitative quantitative logic possible allow efficient assessment eventual improvement
This partly done pure language logic also based experience similar item
This example seen description event analysis hazard tracking log
In sense language proper grammar part qualitative analysis play important role reliability engineering like within
Correct use language also key identifying reducing risk often many failure
This include proper instruction maintenance manual operation manual emergency procedure others prevent systematic human error may result system failure
These written trained experienced technical author using word structure specifically chosen created reduce ambiquity risk confusion
replace old part could ambiguously refer swapping part non part replacing part one using recent hopefully improved design
Reliability modeling process predicting understanding reliability component system prior implementation
Two type analysis often used model complete system availability behavior including effect logistics issue like spare part provisioning transport manpower Fault Tree Analysis reliability block diagram
At component level type analysis used together others
The input model come many source including Testing prior operational experience field data well data handbook similar related industry
Regardless source model input data must used great caution prediction valid case product used context
As prediction often used help compare alternative
For part level prediction two separate field investigation common challenging area must considered computer code provides considerable component system functionality
Reliability defined device perform intended function specified period time stated condition
Mathematically may expressed failure length period time assumed start time zero
There key element definition Quantitative Requirements specified using reliability
The common reliability parameter MTTF also specified expressed frequency conditional probability density function PDF number failure given period
These parameter may useful higher system level system operated frequently
vehicle machinery electronic equipment
Reliability increase MTTF increase
The MTTF usually specified hour also used unit measurement mile cycle
Using MTTF value lower system level misleading especially specify associated Failures Modes Mechanisms The F MTTF
In case reliability specified probability mission success
For example reliability scheduled aircraft flight specified dimensionless probability percentage often used engineering
A special case mission success device system
These device system remain relatively dormant operate
Examples include automobile thermal
reliability specified probability success subsumed related parameter
missile reliability may specified requirement probability hit
For system PFD reliability measure actually unavailability number
The PFD derived failure rate frequency occurrence mission time system
For repairable system obtained failure rate MTTR test interval
This measure may unique given system measure depends kind demand
In addition system level requirement reliability requirement may specified critical subsystem
In case reliability parameter specified appropriate statistical
The purpose reliability testing discover potential problem design early possible ultimately provide confidence system meet reliability requirement
Reliability testing may performed several level different type testing
Complex system may tested component circuit board unit assembly subsystem system level
The test level nomenclature varies among application
For example performing environmental stress screening test lower level piece part small assembly catch problem cause failure higher level
Testing proceeds level integration system testing developmental testing operational testing thereby reducing program risk
However testing mitigate unreliability risk
With test statistical type type error could made depends sample size test time assumption needed discrimination ratio
There risk incorrectly accepting bad design type error risk incorrectly rejecting good design type error
It always feasible test system requirement
Some system prohibitively expensive test may take year observe complex interaction result huge number possible test case test require use limited test range resource
In case different approach testing used highly accelerated life testing
The desired level statistical confidence also play role reliability testing
Statistical confidence increased increasing either test time number item tested
Reliability test plan designed achieve specified reliability specified minimum number test unit test time
Different test plan result different level risk producer consumer
The desired reliability statistical confidence risk level side influence ultimate test plan
The customer developer agree advance reliability requirement tested
A key aspect reliability testing define failure
Although may seem obvious many situation clear whether failure really fault system
Variations test condition operator difference weather unexpected situation create difference customer system developer
One strategy address issue use scoring conference process
A scoring conference includes representative customer developer test organization reliability organization sometimes independent observer
The scoring conference process defined statement work
Each test case considered group scored success failure
This scoring official result used reliability engineer
As part requirement phase reliability engineer develops test strategy customer
The test strategy make need reliability organization want much data possible constraint cost schedule available resource
Test plan procedure developed reliability test result documented
Reliability testing common Photonics industry
Examples reliability test laser life test
These test consist highly accelerated ageing controlled condition group laser
The data collected life test used predict laser life expectancy intended operating characteristic
Reliability test requirement follow analysis first estimate failure probability failure mode effect need justified
Evidence generated level confidence testing
With system probability mix software failure
Testing reliability requirement problematic several reason
A single test case insufficient generate enough statistical data
Multiple test test usually expensive
Some test simply impractical environmental condition hard predict system
Reliability engineering used design realistic affordable test program provides empirical evidence system meet reliability requirement
Statistical used address concern
A certain parameter expressed along corresponding confidence level example hour confidence level
From specification reliability engineer example design test explicit criterion number hour number failure requirement met failed
Different sort test possible
The combination required reliability level required confidence level greatly affect development cost risk customer producer
Care needed select best combination

Reliability testing may performed various level component
Also many factor must addressed testing operation extreme temperature humidity shock vibration environmental factor like loss signal cooling power catastrophe fire flood excessive heat physical security violation myriad form damage degradation
For system must last many year accelerated life test may needed
The purpose induce field failure laboratory much faster rate providing harsher nonetheless representative environment
In test product expected fail lab would failed much le time
The main objective accelerated test either following An Accelerated testing program broken following step Common way determine life stress relationship Software reliability special aspect reliability engineering
System reliability definition includes part system including hardware software supporting infrastructure including critical external interface operator procedure
Traditionally reliability engineering focus critical hardware part system
Since widespread use digital technology software become increasingly critical part electronics hence nearly present day system
There significant difference however software hardware behave
Most hardware unreliability result component material failure result system performing intended function
Repairing replacing hardware component restores system original operating state
However software fail sense hardware fails
Instead software unreliability result unanticipated result software operation
Even relatively small software program astronomically large input state infeasible exhaustively test
Restoring software original state work combination input state result unintended result
Software reliability engineering must take account
Despite difference source failure software hardware several based statistic proposed quantify experience software longer software run higher probability eventually used untested manner exhibit latent defect result failure Musa Denney
As hardware software reliability depends good requirement design implementation
Software reliability engineering relies heavily disciplined process anticipate design
There overlap software software reliability engineering hardware quality reliability
A good software development plan key aspect software reliability program
The software development plan describes design coding standard software model used software development
A common reliability metric number software fault usually expressed fault per thousand line code
This metric along software execution time key software reliability model estimate
The theory software reliability increase number fault fault density decrease go
Establishing direct connection fault density difficult however way software fault distributed code severity probability combination input necessary encounter fault
Nevertheless fault density serf useful indicator reliability engineer
Other software metric complexity also used
This metric remains controversial since change software development verification practice dramatic impact overall defect rate
Testing even important software hardware
Even best software development process result software fault nearly undetectable tested
As hardware software tested several level starting individual unit integration system testing
Unlike hardware inadvisable skip level software testing
During phase testing software fault discovered corrected
Reliability estimate updated based fault density metric
At system level data collected used estimate reliability
Unlike hardware performing exactly test exactly software configuration provide increased statistical confidence
Instead software reliability us different metric
Eventually software integrated hardware system software reliability subsumed system reliability
The Software Engineering Institute common mean assessing overall software development process reliability quality purpose
Reliability engineering concerned overall minimisation failure could lead financial loss responsible entity whereas focus minimising specific set failure type general could lead large scale widespread issue beyond responsible entity
Reliability hazard could transform incident leading loss revenue company customer example due direct indirect cost associated loss production due system unavailability unexpected high low demand spare repair cost multiple interruption normal production etc
Safety engineering often highly specific relating certain tightly regulated industry application area
It primarily focus system safety hazard could lead severe accident including loss life destruction equipment environmental damage
As related system functional reliability requirement often extremely high
Although deal unwanted failure sense reliability engineering however le focus direct cost concerned post failure repair action
Another difference level impact failure society leading tendency strict control government regulatory body
nuclear aerospace defense rail oil industry
This occasionally lead safety engineering reliability engineering contradictory requirement conflicting choice system architecture level
For example train signal control system common practice use system design concept
In example need extremely low failure rate failure lead severe effect like frontal collision two train signalling failure lead two oncoming train track given GREEN light
Such system thankfully designed way vast majority failure
temporary total loss signal open contact relay generate RED light train
This safe state
This mean event failure train stopped immediately
This logic might unfortunately lower reliability system
The reason higher risk false tripping failure whether temporary may trigger safe costly state
Different solution applied similar issue
See section fault tolerance
Reliability increased using redundancy part system level
However redundant element disagree difficult know relied upon
In previous train signalling example could lead lower safety level possibility allowing wrong side undetected dangerous failure
Fault tolerant system often rely additional redundancy
multiple redundant element must agree potentially unsage action performed
This increase reliability safety system level often used operational mission system
This common practice Aerospace system need continued availability mode
For example aircraft may use triple modular redundancy control surface including occasionally different mode operation
need always operational due fact safe default position control surface rudder aileron aircraft flying
The example fault tolerant system increase mission reliability well safety
However basic reliability system case still lower non redundant system
Basic reliability engineering cover failure including might result system failure result additional cost due maintenance repair action logistics spare part etc
For example replacement repair faulty channel voting system system still operating although one failed channel actually become system contributing basic unreliability mission unreliability
As example failure aircraft prevent plane flying considered mission failure need remedied related cost contribute basic unreliability level
When using fault tolerant redundant architecture system system equipped protection function detectability failure avoidance common cause failure becomes paramount safe functioning mission reliability
root manufacturing
Reliability engineering specialty engineering part system engineering
The system engineering process discovery process quite unlike manufacturing process
A manufacturing process focused repetitive activity achieve high quality output minimum cost time
The system engineering process must begin discovering real potential problem need solved biggest failure made system engineering finding elegant solution wrong problem term reliability providing elegant solution wrong root cause system failure
The everyday usage term quality product loosely taken mean inherent degree excellence
In industry precise definition quality conformance requirement specification start use used
Assuming final product specification adequately capture original requirement need quality level measured fraction product unit shipped meet specification
Variation static output may affect quality reliability total picture
More inherent aspect may play role case may readily measured controlled mean
At part level microscopic material variation unavoidable chemical impurity may time due physical chemical loading become macroscopic defect
At system level systematic failure may play dominant role
requirement error software software compiler design flaw
Furthermore complex system questioned derived requirement related product specification truly valid correct
Will result premature failure due excessive wear fatigue corrosion debris accumulation issue maintenance induced failure
Are interaction system level investigated example Fault Tree Analysis
How many system still meet function fulfill need week operation
What performance loss occurred
Did full system failure occur
What happens end warranty period
And happens year common lifetime aircraft train nuclear system etc
That reliability come
These issue far complex controlled standard quality six sigma way working
They need approach
Statement creed fact
Quality snapshot start life mainly related control product specification
This includes defect
manufacturing mistake escaped final Quality Control
In theory quality level might described single fraction defective product
Reliability part system engineering act ongoing account operational capability often many year
Theoretically item fail infinite period time
Defects appear time referred reliability fallout
To describe reliability fallout probability model describes fraction fallout time needed
This known life distribution model
Some reliability issue may due inherent design issue may exist even though product conforms specification
Even item produced perfectly may fail time due one failure mechanism
due human error mechanical electrical chemical factor
These reliability issue also influenced acceptable level variation initial production
Quality therefore related manufacturing reliability related validation lower item requirement system part inherent design life cycle solution
Items conform product specification generally worse term reliability lower MTTF always case
The full mathematical quantification statistical model combined relation general difficult even practically impossible
In case manufacturing variance effectively reduced six sigma tool may useful find optimal process solution increase reliability
Six Sigma may also help design product robust manufacturing induced failure
In contrast Six Sigma reliability engineering solution generally found focusing system design manufacturing process
Solutions found different way simplifying system allow mechanism failure involved understood performing detailed calculation material stress level allowing suitable safety factor determined finding possible abnormal system load condition using increase robustness design manufacturing variance related failure mechanism
Furthermore reliability engineering us solution like designing redundant fault tolerant system situation high availability need see
also quantified measurement based
The core built empirical research statistical analysis
find transfer function directly measurable parameter
This translated practically reliability issue reliability easily measurable due much function time large time may involved especially design phase reliability engineering efficient
Full quantification reliability phase extremely difficult costly due amount testing required
It also may foster management waiting system failure measured decision taken
Furthermore explained page Reliability problem likely come many different cause
inherent failure human error systematic failure besides manufacturing induced defect
Note A defect literature failure Field failure
fractured item reliability
A defect refers generally requirement
basic functionality key dimension
Items however fail time even requirement fulfilled
Quality generally concerned asking crucial question requirement actually correct
whereas reliability
Within entity department related Quality
concerning manufacturing Six Sigma
concerning process control Reliability product design provide input cover complete risk efficiently
Once system part produced reliability engineering attempt monitor ass correct deficiency
Monitoring includes electronic visual surveillance critical parameter identified fault tree analysis design stage
Data collection highly dependent nature system
Most large organization group collect failure data vehicle equipment machinery
Consumer product failure often tracked number return
For system dormant storage standby necessary establish formal surveillance program inspect test random sample
Any change system field upgrade recall repair require additional reliability testing ensure reliability modification
Since possible anticipate failure mode given system especially one human element failure occur
The reliability program also includes systematic identifies causal relationship involved failure effective corrective action may implemented
When possible system failure corrective action reported reliability engineering organization
One common method apply reliability operational assessment FRACAS
This systematic approach develops reliability safety logistics assessment based reporting management analysis action
Organizations today adopting method utilizing commercial system FRACAS application enable create data repository statistic derived view accurate genuine reliability safety quality metric
It extremely important organization adopt common FRACAS system end item
Also allow test result captured practical way
Failure adopt one term ease field engineer repair shop engineer integrated system likely result failure FRACAS program
Some common output FRACAS system includes Field MTBF MTTR Spares Consumption Reliability Growth distribution type location part serial symptom etc
The use past data predict reliability new comparable misleading reliability function context use affected small change
Systems significant complexity developed organization people commercial agency
The reliability engineering organization must consistent company
For small system reliability engineering may informal
As complexity grows need arises formal reliability function
Because reliability important customer customer may even specify certain aspect reliability organization
There several common type reliability organization
The project manager chief engineer may employ one reliability engineer directly
In larger organization usually product assurance organization may include reliability safety etc
In case reliability engineer report product assurance manager specialty engineering manager
In case company may wish establish independent reliability organization
This desirable ensure system reliability often expensive time consuming unduly slighted due budget schedule pressure
In case reliability engineer work project actually employed paid separate organization within company
Because reliability engineering critical early system design become common reliability engineer however organization structured work part
Some university offer graduate degree reliability engineering
Other reliability engineer typically engineering degree field engineering accredited university college program
Many engineering program offer reliability course university entire reliability engineering program

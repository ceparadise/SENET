In attempt determine whether evaluation given definitely terminate
Because termination analysis total
The aim find answer program terminate program terminate whenever possible
Without success algorithm human working termination analysis may answer maybe continue working infinitely long
A type play critical role depends termination
A simple general method constructing termination proof involves associating step algorithm
The measure taken domain
If measure decrease according relation along every possible step algorithm must terminate respect relation
Some type termination analysis automatically generate imply existence termination proof
An example construct may may terminate run repeatedly
Loops implemented using typically found usually terminate demonstrated example If value fixed finite loop eventually terminate assuming terminates
Some loop shown always terminate never terminate human inspection
For example even see theory following never stop may halt physical machine due In termination analysis one may also try determine termination behaviour program depending unknown input
The following example illustrates problem
Here loop condition defined using value UNKNOWN value UNKNOWN known
defined user input program executed
Here termination analysis must take account possible value UNKNOWN find possible case UNKNOWN original example termination shown
There however general procedure determining whether expression involving looping instruction halt even human tasked inspection
The theoretical reason undecidability Halting Problem exist algorithm determines whether given program stop finitely many computation step
In practice one fails show termination every algorithm work finite set method able extract relevant information given program
A method might look variable change respect loop condition possibly showing termination loop method might try transform program calculation mathematical construct work possibly getting information termination behaviour property mathematical model
But method able see specific reason non termination even combination method one cover possible reason non termination
loop equivalent expression expression involving loop written using recursion vice versa
Thus termination recursive expression also undecidable general
Most recursive expression found common usage
shown terminate various mean usually depending definition expression
As example recursive expression function always decrease argument eventually reach recursion terminate
Termination check important programming language theorem proving system like
These system use program proof
Proofs inductively defined data type traditionally described using induction principle
However found later describing program via recursively defined function pattern matching natural way proving using induction principle directly
Unfortunately allowing definition lead logical inconsistency type theory
That termination checker
One approach termination checking dependently typed programming language sized type
The main idea annotate type recurse size annotation allow recursive call smaller argument
Sized type implemented syntactic extension
There several research team work new method show non termination
Many researcher include method program try analyze termination behavior automatically without human interaction
An ongoing aspect research allow existing method used analyze termination behavior program written real world programming language
For declarative language like many result exist mainly strong mathematical background language
The research community also work new method analyze termination behavior program written imperative language like C Java
Because undecidability Halting Problem research field reach completeness
One always think new method find new complicated reason termination
Research paper automated program termination analysis include System description automated termination analysis tool include

I reading terminate TCP connection handshake required FIN FIN ACK ACK
However closing connection Wireshark display FIN ACK FIN ACK ACK never display FIN
However establishing connection Wireshark clearly display three handshake SYN SIN ACK ACK
So I kinda confused closing connection three handshake displayed like
A TCP implementation might send standalone FIN first closing segment
However send FIN ACK instead
The latter strictly better implementation bundle free ACK FIN segment without making longer
This ACK still room segment ACK number ignored waste bandwidth
Hence ACK simply case receiver missed
This true TCP segment
Hence except first SYN segment sender information ACK number segment usually ACK flag
By posting answer agree

You talented programmer Robot Works One day valuable customer Gene Roddenberry Star Trek fame come problem
He creating new TV show called Star Trek The Next Generation one character show Data android
At last minute actor supposed play Data canceled show could find another actor good enough fill part looking Robot Works build actual android
While rest company busily work getting Data built assigned task programming walk simple enough task human robot quite easy
After sorting manual produced group company many grueling hour finally produce function allow Data take single step
You call day
The next day come work bos Applegate asks much progress made
You tell done
I done say
But responds bos written one function
How done
Do need write function teach take two step
And three step
And step
You chuckle slightly knowing smile cross face smile person understands power recursion
What recursion
Sometimes problem difficult complex solve big
If problem broken smaller version may able find way solve one smaller version able build solution entire problem
This idea behind recursion recursive algorithm break problem smaller piece either already know answer solve applying algorithm piece combining result
Stated concisely recursive definition defined term

Cohesion type measurement usually described high cohesion low cohesion
Modules high cohesion tend preferable high cohesion associated several desirable trait software including reliability understandability
In contrast low cohesion associated undesirable trait difficult maintain test reuse even understand
Cohesion often contrasted different concept
High cohesion often correlate vice versa
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured Design cohesion coupling published article book latter two subsequently became standard term software engineering
In method serve class tend similar many aspect class said high cohesion
In highly cohesive system code readability increased complexity kept manageable
Cohesion increased Advantages high cohesion strong cohesion While principle module perfect cohesion consisting single atomic element single function example practice complex task expressible single simple element
Thus module element either complicated order accomplish task narrow thus tightly coupled module
Thus cohesion balanced unit complexity coupling
Cohesion qualitative measure meaning source code measured examined using determine classification
Cohesion type worst best follows Although cohesion ranking type scale rank indicate steady progression improved cohesion
Studies various people including indicate first two type cohesion inferior communicational sequential cohesion good functional cohesion superior
While functional cohesion considered desirable type cohesion software module may achievable
There case communicational cohesion highest level cohesion attained circumstance

A handful nonprofit group working address see national education crisis Too America public school actually teach computer science basic fewer still offer credit
It next decade million job tech sector computer science graduate fill
And percent school teach computer science
So education technology sector industry year growing stepping
At Silicon Valley hotel recently venture capitalist interested party heard funding pitch watched demonstration startup backed incubator called
One aim teach kid year old younger fundamental programming game guide fuzz ball
As soon start learning coding earlier start learning something better later life say Grechen Huebner Kodable
She working two computer screen demonstrate game work
Kids drag drop symbol get fuzzy character go maze learn condition loop function even debugging say
So kid barely shed diaper really learn code
Huebner think vital
We kid young using
Five kinda sweet spot
My daughter behind I think
She started coding
Bad parent
Even kid offered computer science concept growing consensus student get exposed basic computer science concept early
Kodable startup hope make profit filling enormous void American public education
Ninety percent school even teach
So parent school even offer class kid going preparation need century say Hadi Partovi nonprofit
Just like teach electricity work biology basic also know Internet work apps work
Schools need add curriculum
Through Partovi working get kid parent school interested computer science curriculum
public elementary school Baltimore recently took part Hour Code start learn basic coding even though realize
So moving three block press start one say
Gretchen LeGrand nonprofit trying bring computer science fundamental underserved kid city

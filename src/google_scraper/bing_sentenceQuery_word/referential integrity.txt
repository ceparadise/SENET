Referential integrity database feature relational database management system
It ensures relationship table database remain accurate applying constraint prevent user application entering inaccurate data pointing data exist
use table organize information contain
They similar spreadsheet Excel vastly capable advanced user
Databases function use primary key foreign key maintain relationship table
The database table unique identifier assigned record
Each table one column designated primary key
A Social Security number primary key database listing employee Social Security number unique
However privacy concern assigned company ID number better choice function primary key employee
Some database Microsoft primary key automatically random key real meaning
It better use key meaning record
The simplest way enforce referential integrity allow change primary key
A identifier table match primary key different table
The foreign key creates relationship different table referential integrity refers relationship table
When one table foreign key another table concept referential integrity state may add record table contains foreign key unless corresponding record linked table
It also includes technique known cascading update cascading delete ensure change made linked table reflected primary table
Consider situation two table Employees Managers
The Employees table foreign key attribute entitled ManagedBy point record employee manager Managers table
Referential integrity enforces following three rule Using relational system referential integrity offer several advantage There error

Referential integrity RI relational database concept state table relationship must always consistent
In word foreign key field must agree primary key referenced foreign key
Thus primary key field change must applied foreign key
The restriction also applies foreign key update necessarily deletion must propagated primary parent key
Consider bank database contains two table To uniquely identify holder table primary key column named created
To identify customer bank account relationship table existing customer table must referenced
Thus column also created table foreign key
This column special value
Rather value must reference existing identical value primary key column another table column table
Referential integrity standard mean value table may edited without editing corresponding value table
For example Andrew Smith customer ID changed table change also must applied table thus allowing Andrew Smith account information link customer ID

A feature provided prevents user application entering inconsistent data
Most RDBMS various referential integrity rule apply create relationship two
For example suppose Table B point field Table Referential integrity would prevent adding Table B linked Table A
In addition referential integrity rule might also specify whenever delete record Table A record Table B linked deleted record also deleted
This called Finally referential integrity rule could specify whenever modify value linked Table A record Table B linked also modified accordingly

An said referentially transparent corresponding value without changing program behavior
As result referentially transparent function give argument
Such function called
An expression referentially transparent called referentially opaque
In function application referentially definition constitutes
However always case programming term used avoid misleading connotation
In referentially transparent function considered
Some provide mean guarantee referential transparency
Some functional programming language enforce referential transparency function
The importance referential transparency allows reason program behavior
This help proving simplifying assisting modifying code without breaking code mean
As referential transparency requires result given set input point time referentially transparent expression therefore
The concept although term seems originated
It adopted A mode containment φ referentially transparent whenever occurrence singular term purely referential term sentence ψ purely referential also containing term sentence φ ψ
The term appeared contemporary usage discussion seminal set lecture note
The lecture note referenced Quine bibliography
If function involved expression expression referentially transparent
Also impure function included expression value discarded insignificant
Consider function return input source
In pseudocode call function might might identify particular disk file etc
Even identical value successive return value different
Therefore function neither deterministic referentially transparent
A subtle example function depends input explicitly passed parameter
This resolved according rule variable current execution environment variable static binding
Since variable altered without changing value passed parameter result subsequent call function may differ even parameter identical
However pure allowed thus free variable value function still referentially transparent neither variable value change due static binding immutability respectively
Arithmetic operation referentially transparent replaced instance
In fact function mathematical sense referentially transparent transparent since always give result particular
Assignments transparent
For instance expression change value assigned variable
Assuming initially value two consecutive evaluation expression yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
However calling function transparent implicitly change input x thus
transparent evaluate replace value say Jan get result run tomorrow
This depends state date
In language like substitute equal equal every value x
This hold language
If substitution expression value valid certain point execution program expression referentially transparent
The definition ordering theoretical foundation part semantics imperative programming language
However referentially transparent expression evaluated time necessary define sequence point guarantee order evaluation
Programming done without consideration called
One advantage writing code referentially transparent style given intelligent compiler easier better possible automatically
For example programming C performance penalty including call expensive function inside loop even function call could moved outside loop without changing result program
The programmer would forced perform manual call possibly expense source code readability
However compiler able determine function call referentially transparent perform transformation automatically
The primary disadvantage language enforce referential transparency make expression operation naturally fit imperative programming style awkward le concise
Such language often incorporate mechanism make task easier retaining purely functional quality language
As example let use two function one referentially opaque referentially transparent The function referentially transparent mean
For instance
However ca say thing us global variable modifies
The referential opacity make reasoning program difficult
For example say wish reason following statement One may tempted simplify statement However work occurrence evaluates different value
Remember return value based global value passed get modified call
This mean mathematical identity longer hold
Such mathematical identity hold referentially transparent function
However sophisticated analysis used simplify statement This take step requires degree insight code infeasible compiler optimization
Therefore referential transparency allows u reason code lead robust program possibility finding bug could hope find testing possibility seeing opportunity

THE education site computer science ICT A database term
A relational database depends primary key point related record different table
So primary key may point record B table record C table
The two record make information related primary key
For example employee may employee number primary key point salary pay table address address table
This integrity come
If primary key point entry salary table database broken upset employee
So switching referential integrity feature database application make sure record exists table primary key pointing

integrity known referential integrity requires entity referenced data entity must exist database
For example airline reservation requested particular flight number flight referenced number must actually exist

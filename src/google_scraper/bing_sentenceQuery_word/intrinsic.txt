In computer compiler theory function available use given implementation handled specially
Typically may substitute sequence automatically generated original function call similar
Unlike inline function compiler intimate knowledge intrinsic function thus better integrate optimize given situation
Compilers implement intrinsic function generally enable program request otherwise falling back default implementation provided language environment
Intrinsic function often used explicitly implement language address construct
Some API example use intrinsic function declare respectively vectorizable operation compiling
The compiler par intrinsic function convert vector math multiprocessing appropriate target
Compilers Microsoft Intel GCC implement intrinsics map directly instruction SSE
The compiler support inline assembler
To compensate lack inline new intrinsics added map standard assembly instruction normally accessible bit scan
Some C compiler provide intrinsics
Other intrinsics GNU slightly abstracted approximating ability several contemporary platform portable implementation platform appropriate instruction
It common library achieve portability via based platform specific compiler flag providing fully portable primitive vector type mapped onto appropriate implementation still benefiting type system inlining hence advantage linking assembly object file using C ABI
The JVM also intrinsics specific Java APIs
Hotspot intrinsics standard Java APIs may one optimized implementation platform

I trying understand compiler intrinsic function
I find I still kind fuzzy exactly
If someone could provide concrete example would definitely clarify issue
Any help appreciated
One example compiler intrinsic function floating point math function part standard C math library
On CPU architecture support floating point trigonometric function like compiler might replace function call series instruction achieve result using available CPU instruction instead
Another example replacement call C memory copying function
These might implemented directly using instruction available copying block memory many time faster

Sammy love run often go running clear head blow steam
Dani meanwhile hate run doctor told need lose weight might end diabetes
Sammy run
something enjoy find interesting
Compare Dani whose reason running involves something external reward avoid negative consequence
Now may think intrinsic motivation better extrinsic motivation right point
Studies shown people likely stick task invest time task successful intrinsically motivated
However extrinsic motivation place
After without extrinsic motivation many u would never exercise never go work never clean house
Many task required live healthy life extrinsically motivated
Besides like rewarded
Still issue reward
Giving someone reward task actually decrease intrinsic motivation task begin feel like task external reward
This called
One famous example overjustification effect occurred researcher rewarded playing math game
Before given reward many kid played game thought fun
But rewarded playing game child spent far le time playing game rewarded
Why people intrinsically motivated task suddenly change motivation
No one exactly sure overjustification effect occurs couple thing scientist know likely occur
For one thing overjustification effect really happens task high intrinsic motivation begin
If someone interested task reward interest wo decrease given reward
For another thing reward performance le likely cause overjustification effect reward given task
In word given candy play game likely decrease intrinsic motivation game given candy win game

Though psychologist completely sure overjustification effect occurs theory
One theory people engage behavior justify action
If get reward decide must like get reward might decide reward
Thus convince really like
This called
Closely related overjustification effect power
This light punishment cause behavior change severe punishment
Let look example
Dylan Riley preschooler like play toy
Whenever teacher looking Dylan Riley sneak toy shelf play
The teacher catch Dylan playing toy one day punishes severely
She give long let play toy entire week
Another day catch Riley playing toy instead giving severe punishment give light punishment
She take toy tell play toy
Because Dylan got severe punishment theory say tell play toy want get caught
He still intrinsically motivated play toy scared punished
After fear wear Dylan still want play toy might go back get
However Riley got light punishment
The punishment serious enough tell play toy afraid punishment
So according theory Riley find another way justify play toy getting caught
Because Riley tell really like toy
Because intrinsically motivated play toy le likely Dylan go back try play
occurs someone something love find interesting whereas someone something external reward avoid negative consequence
When someone rewarded something want decrease intrinsic motivation
This called
When someone given light punishment intrinsic motivation bad behavior decreased

One little factor sometimes make difference life
If fan watching police chase video know one little wrong decision could truly spell disaster driver pedestrian
This lesson go one little factor small ca even see
Despite factor size capable causing big problem
In fact lack factor opposed presence killed others due condition known pernicious anemia
Your stomach obviously important organ digestion
You know help secrete acid kill potentially deadly bacteria found food
The acid also help break food better absorption
The acid produced stomach made cell called
Parietal cell cell stomach secrete gastric acid
What important lesson parietal cell also secrete something known IF
Intrinsic factor protein bind vitamin terminal ileum absorb body
also known cobalamin terminal ileum last segment small intestine
An interesting side note may help remember technical name vitamin reason vitamin called cobalamin mineral cobalt
Anyways cobalamin mainly obtained diet animal product meat milk
When chewing favorite piece steak saliva release sort thing help lubricate digest food mouth
One protein released saliva known R protein
This protein along tasty piece meat travel stomach swallow food
Here stomach acid enzyme protein increase speed biochemical reaction release cobalamin protein source
Once cobalamin released stomach R protein bind right
This R combination move duodenum first part small intestine
Here pancreatic enzyme secreted duodenum free cobalamin R protein
Thereafter IF originally produced stomach finally bind cobalamin
This combination travel duodenum ileum absorbed body
Any defect long sequence event lead inadequate absorption vitamin
The one I want focus lesson disease called
Pernicious anemia autoimmune disease attack parietal cell intrinsic factor causing cobalamin malabsorption subsequent anemia
The problem people pernicious anemia body produce autoantibody target destroy parietal cell
Normal antibody fired manner speaking immune system kill invading pathogen bacteria
If attack body cell due malfunction called autoantibody
Autoantibodies protein attack master speak
It like gun fire bullet bullet like boomerang come back hurt person fired gun
In case autoantibody destroy damage incapacitate parietal cell stomach like bullet would incapacitate someone
In case enough IF secreted pernicious anemia
Logically mean enough cobalamin absorbed
Another problem autoantibody simply bind neutralize intrinsic factor instead meaning autoantibody bind IF block intrinsic factor ability bind cobalamin
Imagine someone glued hand basketball
That sticky basketball like autoantibody
If happens hand stuck unable bind catch anything else
The problem cobalamin important many thing including proper red blood cell formation DNA synthesis proper neurological function
Therefore deficiency cause serious issue
In pernicious anemia CBC complete blood count reveal macrocytic anemia
condition result decreased number red blood cell hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity blood diminished leading inadequate oxygen delivery body tissue organ cell
refers abnormally increased size red blood cell macrocytic anemia result improper DNA synthesis
This impaired DNA synthesis also cause abnormal decrease white blood cell called shape nucleus
On physical exam person pernicious anemia may paleness skin weakness red thick sore tongue well sensation pin needle result nerve dysfunction
Mood change memory loss depression occur serious case well
An endoscopic examination biopsy may reveal atrophic gastritis inflammation destruction stomach due autoimmune disease
A biopsy basically like little bite sample taken stomach instrument
Just like took bite favorite food order get vitamin take little bite tissue help diagnose disease
Another important test aware called Schilling test
In first part test vitamin injected patient order saturate patient receptor vitamin
After radioactive dose cobalamin given patient
It radioactive easily tracked
Get FREE access day create account
In normal person radioactive cobalamin absorbed ileum excreted urine since much vitamin body result first vitamin injection initially saturated body receptor vitamin
If know general rule aware vitamin B C vitamin excreted urine excess
If however radioactive vitamin found urine mean problem absorption vitamin body
This due lack IF due something else entirely like bacterial overgrowth eating cobalamin person absorb Crohn disease damaging ileum absorptive capacity
To distinguish two category two step I described repeated
However time around radioactive vitamin given IF
If cobalamin appears urine know problem due lack IF
If still appear urine due something else
Treatment pernicious anemia consists injection vitamin
The anemia reverse time neurological damage may permanent
Now people claim human need consume vitamin diet animal product
Their main argument gut bacteria make vitamin therefore need consume
This true
Well first part anyways
Human gut bacteria produce vitamin
But argument need consume misleading
The problem majority gut bacteria produce significant amount vitamin colon
This part intestine come terminal ileum place absorbs vitamin human
This mean unless eat feces depend colonic bacteria vitamin
This brings something else
There animal precisely eat poop
It may look disgusting unless get full amount nutrient diet including B vitamin
Other animal depend dietary intake vitamin coprophagia consumption feces bacteria gastrointestinal system produce vitamin early section digestive tract
For lesson recall cell stomach secrete gastric acid protein bind vitamin terminal ileum absorb body
also known cobalamin terminal ileum last segment small intestine
An autoimmune disease attack parietal cell intrinsic factor causing cobalamin malabsorption subsequent anemia called
In pernicious anemia CBC complete blood count reveal macrocytic anemia
condition result decreased number red blood cell hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity blood diminished leading inadequate oxygen delivery body tissue organ cell
refers abnormally increased size red blood cell macrocytic anemia result improper DNA synthesis
This impaired DNA synthesis also cause abnormal decrease white blood cell called
On physical examination person pernicious anemia may paleness skin weakness red thick sore tongue well sensation pin needle result nerve dysfunction

An property property system material within
It independent much material present independent form material one large piece collection small particle
Intrinsic property dependent mainly chemical composition structure material
A property essential inherent called property
For example intrinsic property whereas extrinsic property varies depending strength gravitational field respective object placed
In biology intrinsic effect originate inside organism cell disease

Before I delve topic let share exciting announcement
Last week Lithium launched first feature
The Badging feature first many plan add already robust gamification engine
excited see gamification theory work productized near future
forget let know comment new badging feature
OK back lifting fog
Last time I discussed motivation difference intrinsic extrinsic motivation
Now go one step talk reward difference intrinsic extrinsic reward
Although motivation reward critical design implementation gamification strategy gamification practitioner articulate subtle difference intrinsic motivation intrinsic reward
Some even treat distinctive concept synonymously ridiculously wrong
Since post build concept introduced last post read yet please take minute
It critical understand fundamental concept around motivation jumping discussion
Review
As may recall motivation reason drive someone something
behavior activity
Reward completely different animal
It get something rather reason first place
A way look difference motivation reward motivation come behavior reward come behavior
So distinction intrinsic extrinsic reward
An intangible award recognition sense achievement conscious satisfaction
For example knowledge something right helped someone made day better
Because intrinsic reward intangible usually arise within person activity behavior
So case mean reward intrinsic person activity behavior
An award tangible physically given accomplishing something
It tangible recognition one endeavor
For example certificate accomplishment trophy medal winning race badge point something right even monetary reward job
Because extrinsic reward tangible usually given person activity typically within person
Therefore extrinsic reward mean reward extrinsic performer activity behavior
Here important distinction I like emphasize
When talking reward intrinsic reward originate within person extrinsic reward originate something beyond person
might recall previous talking motivation intrinsic extrinsic nothing whether motivation originates within person outside person
Instead mean whether motivation intrinsic activity
Here tricky part stay
Some people may driven reward
So reward sometimes reason drive people thing
Thus reward get sometimes motivation
However people thing many reason beyond reward many motivation reward
Since reward sometimes motivation intrinsic motivation extrinsic
This important question one confused many gamification industry
You see I said tricky
difficult see something reward least something simply love
intrinsic motivation
So activity behavior motivated reward always extrinsically motivated
In word reward become reason drive someone activity behavior purely sake anymore
Therefore intrinsic reward extrinsic definition extrinsic
extrinsic activity behavior
Just happen use set word
describe two different concept
reward motivation mean word mean thing
This unfortunate consequence fact human language simply precise enough compared mathematics computer science
This compounded fact academic research tends narrowly focused disparate discipline often enough communication
When speaking motivation term mean respect reason something simply love thing
But speaking reward term mean respect reward originates within person activity
Next time talk person company claiming expert gamification ask difference reward motivation
I guarantee able spot fake professional
I hope last two post removed topic
Please let know comment clarification would like

Hello Glad find post insightful
Hope like rest article
See next time
Greetings Wu I deeply enjoyed clarity expressed blog series
Indeed I trying explain concept Denver high school
So I question even greater clarity
Does pushing ever extrinsic motivation reward tend reduce person intrinsic motivation task
Does person move internal locos joy external locus definition le satisfying
I sure I believe relationship yet I know various example could explained way

Are way intrinsic motivation
I presume answer yes yet also presume know
My rationale A
If work create activity meet need teacher also entail autonomy choice learn learn mastery show measurable progress measured extrinsically performed others classroom relatedness shown lead deeper meaning recognizably extrinsic shift locus motivation outside student within
B
People desire recognition work behavior premise yet recognition definition extrinsic
Is risk recognizing intrinsically motivated behavior leading reduction behavior
As relatedness mastery purpose listed inextricably tied thing outside body Thanks advance engaging reading
I love concept explanation
Sincerely Terry Rosen Glad like
Thx letting know
Hello First apology responding late
The notification email comment got stuck clutter folder I recover
Thank question
Let give stab see I clarify

Although science keep discovering new finding far data suggest extrinsic reward crowding effect intrinsic motivation
That keep pushing extrinsic reward people inadvertently reduce intrinsic motivation task
It know overjustification effect
It fairly well documented phenomenon
That said mean effect apply everyone every case
Some people intrinsic motivation may strong simple pay attention extrinsic reward
Which case admirable academician artist musician etc
refuse bought
Some may call stupid simply conviction
However I would say extrinsic reward definition le satisfying different
They often satisfy people faster satisfaction feeling also go away faster
So extrinsic reward seen satisfying intrinsic short term
But longer time horizon yes extrinsic le satisfying intrinsic counterpart

The answer yes hard
A
You shift people locus motivation outside within keep mind simply shift focus extrinsic reward intrinsic reward still extrinsic motivation
The trick student really learn epiphany realization like aha moment
But really difficult tell student really learned something
They remember actually learn anything
They may want even act like enjoy really learn love sake
Bottom line easy
B
Yes recognition extrinsic motivation intrinsic reward tangible
Remember reward intrinsic extrinsic extrinsic motivation part behavior
I think danger recognizing intrinsic motivation leading reduction behavior ca really recognize intrinsic motivation easily
Like I said external measure never really know real reason someone something
And hard prove would take away extrinsic motivation include intrinsic reward well extrinsic reward demonstrate person still love task
Remember intrinsic motivation mean reason something inherent part behavior mean drive something actually nothing else please read deeper discussion
So I would recognize lightly seriously emphasize exemplary behavior really sure intrinsically motivated really prove
Ok I hope I clarify confusion may
But anything still unclear please let know
I happy discus
Great article thank
Hi post indeed insightful
I would like know reward like recognition like pat back praiseworthy word infront peer considered instrinsic reward non tangible considered extrinsic reward external internal one satisfaction
Can classify non tangible reward acknowledgement good work infront peer pat back etc intrinsic reward

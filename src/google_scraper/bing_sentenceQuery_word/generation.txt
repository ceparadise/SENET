In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

Term somewhat imprecisely applied computer system use physically small neat using chip LSI

However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

The Present Beyond FGCS initiative Japan begun create computer using
It result massive research project Japan
It aimed create computer performance provide platform future development
There also unrelated Russian project also named computer see
In Trip report paper Ehud Shapiro focused FGCS project software foundation project captured rationale motivation driving huge project As part Japan effort become leader computer industry Institute New Generation Computer Technology launched revolutionary plan development large computer system applicable knowledge information processing system
These Fifth Generation computer built around concept logic programming
In order refute accusation Japan exploit knowledge abroad without contributing project stimulate original research make result available international research community
The term fifth generation intended convey system leap beyond existing machine
In computer using called first generation second third using fourth
Whereas previous computer generation focused increasing number logic element single CPU fifth generation widely believed time would instead turn massive number CPUs added performance
The project create computer period considered ended investment new sixth generation project would begin
Opinions outcome divided either failure ahead time
In late till early much talk generation computer hardware usually three generation
Omitted taxonomy computer based metal gear mechanical relay Mark I computer based Very Large Scale Integrated circuit
There also parallel set generation software Throughout multiple generation Japan largely follower computing arena building computer following British lead
The MITI decided attempt break pattern started looking small scale future computing
They asked JIPDEC indicate number future direction offered contract carry study along industry academia
It period term computer started used
Prior MITI guidance success improved steel industry creation oil automotive industry consumer electronics computer memory
MITI decided future going
However language written spoken form presented still present major obstacle computer
These hurdle could taken lightly
So MITI held conference invited people around world help
The primary field investigation initial project The project imagined computer performance using massively parallel
The aim build parallel computer artificial intelligence application using concurrent logic programming
The FGCS project vast finding contributed greatly development concurrent logic programming field
The target defined FGCS project develop Knowledge Information Processing system roughly meaning applied
The chosen tool implement goal
Logic programming approach characterized Maarten Van Emden one founder More technically summed two equation The Axioms typically used universal axiom restricted form called
The statement proved computation existential statement
The proof constructive provides value existentially quantified variable value constitute output computation
Logic programming thought something unified various gradient computer science
It seemed logic programming missing link knowledge engineering parallel computer architecture
In visit ICOT invented Concurrent novel concurrent programming language integrated logic programming concurrent programming
Concurrent Prolog logic programming language designed concurrent programming parallel execution
It embodies synchronization basic control mechanism
described language Report marked ICOT Technical Report presented Concurrent Prolog written Prolog
Shapiro work Concurrent Prolog inspired change direction FGCS focusing parallel implementation Prolog focus software foundation project
It also inspired concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses GHC Ueda basis programming language finally designed implemented FGCS project core programming language
The project imagined computer running top massive opposed traditional using define access data
They envisioned building prototype machine performance LIPS LIPS At time typical workstation machine capable LIPS
They proposed build machine period year initial R D year building various subsystem final year complete working prototype system
In government decided go ahead project established joint investment various Japanese computer company
So ingrained belief parallel computing future performance gain project generated great deal apprehension computer field
After seen Japanese take field apparently world Japanese reputation invincibility
Soon parallel project set US MCC UK Europe ESPRIT well ECRC collaboration Britain France Germany
Five running PIM eventually produced
The project also produced application run system parallel Kappa automated well application
The FGCS Project meet commercial success reason similar company
The highly parallel computer architecture eventually surpassed speed le specialized hardware example Sun workstation machine
The project produce new generation promising Japanese researcher
But FGCS Project stopped funding computer research project research momentum developed FGCS Project dissipated
However embarked Sixth Generation Project
A primary problem choice concurrent logic programming bridge parallel computer architecture use logic knowledge representation problem solving language AI application
This never happened cleanly number language developed limitation
In particular committed choice feature interfered logical semantics language
Another problem existing CPU performance quickly pushed obvious barrier expert perceived value parallel computing quickly dropped point time used niche situation
Although number increasing capacity designed built project lifespan generally found soon outperformed shelf unit available commercially
The project also suffered wrong side technology curve
During lifespan became mainstream computer enabled locally stored database become distributed even simple research project provided better result data mining
Moreover project found promise largely negated use committed choice
At end period project spent billion US million exchange rate terminated without met goal
The workstation appeal market general purpose system could take job even outrun
This parallel Lisp machine market system could run computer making expensive Lisp machine unnecessary
In spite possibility considering project failure many approach envisioned project logic programming distributed massive current technology
For example OWL employ several layer knowledge representation system
It appears however new technology reinvented rather leveraged approach investigated initiative
In early century many flavor began proliferate including architecture high end
When CPUs began move GHz range problem became important
The ability produce single CPU system linked periodic doubling transistor count began threatened
Ordinary consumer machine began parallel processor like
company like Nvidia AMD began introducing large parallel system like open CL
Again however clear development facilitated significant way project
In summary strong case made project ahead time debatable whether counter justifies claim failure

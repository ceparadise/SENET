In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine
Perhaps need scroll right bit

Are implementation even academic work regarding application capable looking code inferring code actually intends
For example give program calculates SQRT x go annotate particular piece code SQRT X regardless implementation technique
Say use recursion instead loop still able infer code intends
Pattern matching really option
Another example Say program computes sum inverse square starting
It print mathematical equivalent expression result
Something like SIGMA It hinted comment general task giving explanation arbitrary piece code automated analysis impossible
The first issue giving meaning term program intent
The field give u precise definition piece code run concrete computer hypothesis compiler interpreter free programing error person wrote code obviously divined code
piece code may intended say crash given negative number input outcome may result programmer oversight
However might desirable say infer various mathematical property arbitrary piece code example might want infer This also impossible general
This somewhat surprising fact demonstrated using essentially say property like statement proven refuted automatically arbitrary program
That said substantial body work aim identifying proving property concrete program implementation
Because Rice theorem attempt must incomplete practice much done real world program
This field usually designated term even short summary would significantly effort I ready put forward right
A good overview found
This essentially impossible
Not programming language natural language like English even
For example Google Translate ca actually determine essence trying say
All Google Translate reality match pattern syntax recognition bell whistle form allowing synonymous term phrase etc allow flexibility
The extent semantic analysis effective actually limited
Your question implied compiler implementation mean achieve sort semantic meaning derivation given program
The compiler analyze token word symbol match specific pattern token label whatever analyze whether recognized pattern correct order make sense consideration particular context whether could substituted equivalent expression structure
But imagine finite amount rule instruct compiler recognize
But attempt build compiler extract ultimate meaning program expecting something sometimes even perfectly
Sometimes really underestimate power human mind extract meaning
To try implement functionality program much like trying implement program really understand abstract thing like movie meaning
Or song
We level yet
Again implement small finite set rule allow program express one thing many form pattern matching
And essentially semantic analysis still pattern matching
There currently algorithm computer understand work abstraction
All type algorithm ultimately ca recognize anything written
abstraction would necessary truly determining meaning program
That said compiler recognize structure replace optimize completely remove etc
point much need understand done whole
In fact I think many programmer good enough know replace program write better time
So follows programmer responsible writing program capable would good enough even would hard write

Is tool examining configuration schema database dubious field relationship configuration similar flag dubious line code
I necessarily asking normalization surely stupid stuff detected without solving Hard AI Halting Problem
I regularly use SqlSpec It make nice documentation navigate html chm format work database
It completely flawless quite good affordable author responds email I appreciate
Not sure absolutely everything looking red gate tool rock
Check
This used analyze transform database model
We use ClearSQL
Not spotless pretty comprehensive fast I really like user interface
What database vendor targeting
SQL Server Tool ApexSQL Enforce I found useful
It generates schema chart detailed HTML report via ODBC
It HTML output describes basic questionable design It pretty useful
Perhaps rule added

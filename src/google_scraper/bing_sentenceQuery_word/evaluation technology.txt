Higher Education Research Development Unit University College London Torrington Place London England Tel Evaluation characterised process people make judgement value worth however context learning technology judgement process complex often controversial
This article provides context analysing complexity summarising important debate wider evaluation community
These related context learning technology resulting identification range specific issue
These include paradigm debate move evaluation attempt provide tool support evaluation authenticity problem defining measuring cost role checklist influence quality agenda evaluation way process evaluation affected use learning technology
Finally issue drawn together order produce agenda research area
Evaluation Learning technology Practice Evaluation put simply process people make value judgement thing
In context learning technology judgement usually concern educational value innovation pragmatic introducing novel teaching technique resource
Less frequent still important judgement cost innovation
Judgements worth opposed value terminology Guba Lincoln
This article summarises current issue concerning evaluation learning technology focus Higher Education
As well acting general introduction area provide context article form basis special issue
These selected Evaluation Learning Technology conference took place London Oliver represent important topic discussed event
The full range topic presented Oliver
In order provide adequate context article article open summary relevant trend broader evaluation community
This followed section theme related learning technology important development illustrated
Finally conclusion drawn highlight area likely remain important future
The focus mainstream evaluation journal social policy often concentrating implementation governmental initiative
Although many concern specific context learning technology newly emerging discipline still grappling problem debated decade within mainstream forum
For reason useful open discussion broader context
Perhaps long running discussion within evaluation community paradigm debate
This focus merit qualitative versus quantitative evaluation method
On one hand quantitative method claim objective support generalisable conclusion
On qualitative method lay claim flexibility sensitivity meaningful conclusion specific problem
Quantitative evaluator challenged colleague ground reliability sample validity subjectivity whilst qualitative practitioner responded kind challenge concerning relevance reductionism neglect alternative world view
Although debate continued decade see Light Smith recent year discussion topic started wane
Several factor argued contributed development
The first simply neither side able put forward conclusive argument
The implication magic bullet evaluation Oliver Conole
Instead different methodology useful depending situation evaluation take place
This closely related second important theme
Within evaluation community new philosophy emerged eschews firm commitment one paradigm favour focus pragmatism
Rather theoretical underpinning involves view acknowledges different underpinnings exist adopts required context audience
This approach well illustrated Patton evaluation
Central view idea evaluation mean end rather end
Methodological concern validity reliability considered secondary whether process help people thing
Patton provides various example real evaluation perfectly executed well documented sat unread shelf completed
In contrast also illustrates quick dirty informal method provided people information need take crucial decision affect future major social programme
evaluation like participative evaluation Patton also illustrates third theme
This shift power away evaluator arbiter acting commissioning authority towards evaluation collaborative process building mutual understanding
Perhaps ultimate expression action research Schön set aim empowering practitioner providing framework enables carry evaluation
One important consequence shift add educative element process judging value
This philosophy underpins notion evaluative enquiry strategy organisational learning Preskill Torres
This approach advocate continuous process evaluation practitioner opposed evaluator strategy dealing organisational change meeting need responsive adaptive organisational structure
Interestingly philosophy also represents shift learning process informing individual position power model learning
Brown et
Moreover style evaluation represents shift focus away programme project ongoing evaluation process system
It requires creation culture reflective practice similar implied action research led research strategy efficiently communicating building knowledge Torres Preskill Piontek
A final theme section status evaluation challenged process similar aim
For example relative merit evaluation auditing recently discussed Gunvaldsen Karlsen relationship evaluation quality assurance procedure started investigated Gilroy et
To take one example performance management recently compared evaluation research way making programme accountable Blalock
In discussion two approach contrasted term performance management emphasis outcome result evaluation focus understanding event come pas
Given forum debate occurred surprising much discussion focus shortcoming performance management Shortcomings evaluation research also identified however difficulty making information available timely need manner relative expensiveness
The predictable outcome debate finer delineation situation well suited approach recognition different procedure may many way complementary
In many way appears follow pattern earlier paradigm debate seems likely conclude similar way
Whilst brief synopsis selected theme hope justice breadth depth debate within community help provide context evaluation learning technology considered
Having provided groundwork specific instance evaluation considered right
Learning technology area many name definition
It encompass educational multimedia learning learning whole host related topic usually understood synonymous Educational Technology Oliver Bradley
Irrespective terminology term focus use technology support innovation teaching learning
In context evaluation immediately provides scope agenda
Evaluation becomes focused issue value innovation pragmatic introducing mainstream ethic testing real student
Moreover pragmatic emphasis arises fact much learning technology research development Higher Education funded form project
A common condition funding project team able demonstrate achieved aim usually kind evaluation
Tavistock
Given context possible review recent discussion identify current issue facing evaluation learning technology
In section selection presented including theme unique learning technology well reflect concern wider evaluation community
Just mainstream evaluation recognised different methodology strength weakness similar position accepted within context learning technology
Several author advocated using qualitative quantitative methodology order triangulate result
Jones et thus enhancing credibility evaluation finding Breen et
Such model described hybrid approach
Oliver Conole
Other important factor contributed development include adoption approach mainstream evaluation
Tavistock description different strength weakness approach
Harvey
However paradigm debate entirely dead
An evaluation evaluation conference learning technology identified position two keynote speaker one focused qualitative method quantitative single divisive feature term participant feedback Oliver
In part reflects diverse background researcher within learning technology
As inherently multidisciplinary research area involves academic wide range discipline education psychology computer science etc
tradition value criterion practice Becher
Consequently come surprise different member learning technology research community find method persuasive others
An important consequence realisation one criterion deciding usefulness methodology whether audience find approach persuasive even acceptable
Although consensus may reached amongst evaluator sensitivity issue continue important
The link research funding need evaluation led many practitioner carrying study
This marked contrast traditional mainstream evaluation traditionally involved external expert called carry study although push evaluation learning technology towards inclusive approach
Several issue identified relate situation
It argued example bringing external expert behalf commissioning group may allow professional le biased study
However evaluation team involved also advantage timeliness understanding innovation access data Bradbeer
Another important concern practitioner may expert range area may prior experience carrying evaluative study Oliver Conole
In addition evaluation often form relatively low priority within project least unfamiliar poorly supported activity seem unrelated completion tangible project aim
Such perception jeopardise value even completion study Oliver et
The nature funding area mean issue outlined solved borne mind
Many project conform evaluation requirement funding body leaving little room argument might best placed carry evaluation ideal situation
One pragmatic strategy coping problem focus appropriate type evaluation type evaluator undertake
Bradbeer example suggests internal evaluator focus formative evaluation leaving summative evaluation people external programme
Another approach involves development resource provide support practitioner discussed
The need practitioner carry evaluation outlined led concern expertise
Lecturers example may expertise discipline teaching unreasonable assume expertise training many case even experience carrying programme evaluation Oliver Conole
As consequence several tool developed support practitioner engaging evaluation
Harvey example provides series evaluation recipe summarising methodology easy follow form complete hint tip
These contributed author expertise using particular approach providing rich accessible knowledge base practitioner draw upon
Whilst cookbook provides guide implementing evaluation study ELT toolkit Oliver focus design
It structured around model evaluation design incorporates six stage first two last relating context middle three focusing detail study
These step follows Oliver et At step user complete activity support use structured knowledge base consisting description method
This argued help make informed decision would otherwise beyond existing level expertise
The toolkit based pragmatic framework methodology use outlined single approach presented correct
Instead described term distinguishing characteristic purpose exercise allow practitioner select approach best suited current situation
An integrated approach cover design application Flashlight programme
The Flashlight project produced toolkit provides simple structure evaluation practitioner
The tool based analysis three element The tool also provides guidance considers characteristic good evaluation
These include study situation Although may useful determining whether particular evaluation context good focus choosing situation suit Flashlight methodology rather selecting approach suit situation
The bulk tool concerned identifying question used generate data
This includes consideration five thematic prompt
question use technology access Current Student Inventory repository question devised user
Based brainstorming exercise question created possibly based incorporating example Inventory used survey structured interview
Although interview mentioned focus tool quite clearly questionnaire design
The Flashlight tool based premise different educator need ask similar question Ehrmann
This position challenged Oliver Conole albeit useful one
This assumption allows Flashlight project justify focus one type methodology ignores variety appropriate methodology ELT toolkit example seek identify Oliver Conole
Although criticism project clearly made important recognise tool provided focused usefulness usability employed successfully range real setting Ehrmann
A comparable approach involves creation handbook CUTSD project Phillips et
This resource also incorporates design implementation guideline focus one particular approach action inquiry
However unlike Flashlight tool claim made general applicability
The handbook clearly contains information advice would use practitioner engaged action research
However fact created one specific project allowed provide depth specialist information rather breadth required general resource
As methodology range tool designed support practitioner broad designed specific aim mind
Importantly little research carried investigates impact resource
Whilst tool clearly potential provide great support practitioner relative merit yet fully understood
Learning technology heart pragmatic discipline
A aim researcher field make difference student lecturer organisation based
As consequence surprised authenticity evaluation great concern evaluator working area
Authenticity defined notion closely evaluation capture context existing course Oliver Conole
Controlled experiment example criticised little relevance real classroom practice
Draper
Moreover argued rather discounting difference individual order argue sample population representative evaluation ought recognise understand difference Gunn
Such approach represents important move away technological determinism Jones towards situated model learning
Brown et reminiscent shift individual social model learning mainstream evaluation
The result position method evaluation developed concentrate notion authenticity
The approach adopted Open University example us controlled observation formative evaluation development resource supplement survey carried real student using resource part course
Integrative evaluation developed TILT project Draper focus improving use resource adopted course
Because designed use real course decision use learning technology already made eschews attempt make controlled study learning technology use
However use quantitative approach analyse difference student
At greater extreme ethnography advocated way making sense really happens course learning technology introduced step make authenticity entire process Jones
The evaluation cost learning technology highly problematic area comparatively little written
However increased drive accountability Higher Education profile issue raised considerably
The area made complex number issue remain open debate
These include Oliver Conole Responses issue vary considerably
On one hand rigorous method accounting cost developed Bacsich et
These attempted identify cost often neglected incorporate accounting exercise
On hand method developed recognise problem costing intangible benefit example hence use triangulated qualitative data supplement quantitative information
When used basis decision making approach considerable utility avoids difficulty reducing complex situation figure Oliver et
Other alternative may feasible specific condition
It may possible example evaluate change cost nothing improve benefit cost ratio simple way say provision new resource student Doughty
It interesting note however attempt account complexity situation measuring benefit soon come resemble evaluation educational effectiveness
It may well prove useful way evaluate cost simply provide effective method auditing cost complement mainstream evaluation learning technology use
A common method evaluation advocated area learning technology checklist
Essentially consist list issue commonly arise process designing implementing learning technology
Users asked review resource make judgement based structured consideration
This approach support decision making providing structured approach help prompt potential user consider factor might otherwise neglect
A wide range checklist developed slightly different focus
That Blease example involves initial categorisation piece software one five type arcade simulation game lab simulation tool
Each supported extensive series question intended promote reflection appropriateness software
These question grouped together heading documentation presentation layout friendliness flexibility achievement stated aim robustness
Within section range pragmatic pedagogic issue covered ranging program accompanying documentation software flexible enough used variety situation Although question may well useful framework claim exhaustive example would reference material encyclopaedia addressed
also dated
Technological development mean many issue neglected use sound video
In addition recent development web addressed checklist
Another useful illustration checklist provided staff development pack developed Evaluation Development Review Unity EDRU
These resource intended allow practitioner lacking experience evaluation ass impact project activity
The EDRU material come two part booklet containing overview different aspect evaluation EDRU guide carrying Sommerlad
The former contains short paper wide range issue including curriculum development staff development evaluating organisational issue designing implementing evaluation strategy
The latter aim encourage process reflection rather act cook book evaluation
It provides guide evaluation design starting assessing need evaluation identifying stakeholder choosing method acting finding role evaluator
Detail kept minimum order provide useful overview
However prevent analytical method covered depth cause problem le experienced evaluator
Generally value checklist called doubt
A wide range criticism levelled including Tergan A problem whilst checklist help practitioner ask important question identify key issue help resolve problem
The lack expertise make checklist useful also make demanding question difficult impossible answer
Essentially although checklist may useful prompt reviewer gathering factual information cost technical requirement value sole basis evaluation limited
This particularly true interpretative issue considered
However may valuable term identifying standard designer discussed
Another suggestion extremely valuable used alongside evaluation method drawing shortlist package evaluated greater depth second round evaluation Le Voi Morris
Even used appropriately however important resource updated regularly order address technological development
The introduction quality assurance agenda Higher Education many implication evaluation positive negative
Although place critical reflection high institutional agenda also foster climate negative outcome problematic risk likely replaced attempt compliance Thorpe
It possible problem could avoided focus quality enhancement rather absolute judgement
Such approach implicitly acknowledges failure occur almost inevitably room improvement within educational endeavour
This focus would well served ongoing formative evaluation methodology integrative evaluation focus improving rather testing situation
As well concern number link quality evaluation worth highlighting
One link arises evaluation role identifying documenting example good practice Whittington
Similarly argued checklist valuable role play standard example selection material inclusion portal site Belcher et
In general would appear evaluation much offer investigator quality learning technology
Given area still developed predetermined measure performance unlikely great use Blalock consequently quality framework use formative evaluation method identify potential improvement may well appropriate
Oliver et
The final theme section impact learning technology process evaluation
The use computer automate routine task type data collection analysis obvious
However number subtle change also taken place
This illustrated example change arise focus group methodology applied online environment
Cousin Deepwell observed shift resulted loss spontaneity inability take body language consideration reliance participant motivation engage pull technology bulletin board opposed push face face
On positive note also noted change facilitated data capture allowed larger group participate gave time reflection deliberation
Such change likely vary methodology methodology even situation situation
Although may predictable important aware tried tested approach give rise problem novel situation
A cautionary tale given Jones concerning use ethnographic method evaluate online community
One study saw group student fake online collaboration working together create script could use enough online evidence guarantee good mark
Such consideration highlight importance creating reflective community practitioner concerned evaluation learning technology
If issue identified understood reflecting sharing experience evaluation considerable value wider learning technology research community
Although notion evaluation rooted relatively simple concept process judging value learning technology complex challenging
However emergence critical literature reflects issue allowed number theme identified clear development made
These echo discussion taken place wider evaluation community
These development broadly characterised move fixed epistemological position situation greater plurality viewpoint valued
At heart pragmatic focus utility evaluation
Also important context learning technology awareness priority setting evaluation agenda
These include importance authenticity adoption model learning prevalence evaluation
The implication research evaluation clear
Whilst influence educational context work seems agreed upon greater attention need paid impact learning technology process evaluation
Additionally information need gathered appropriate approach adopt different situation including strategy communicating finding effectively
Costs need better understood strategy using checklist link evaluation form judgement Higher Education quality assessment
Most importantly however research agenda must translated community critical reflection support value increased understanding issue
For practitioner situation complex
Although tool developed support novice evaluator value yet demonstrated
Their relative usefulness effectiveness need understood way improving resource way used must identified
Moreover current climate learning technology research development relies practitioner learn evaluation one often relatively unimportant task amongst many
If current expectation practitioner carry evaluation continues strategy training supporting must developed implemented
Evaluation form unique meeting point policy theory practice consequence seems unlikely practice ever uncontentious
Whilst ideal world may desirable solve problem immediate priority issue well understood evaluator respond sensitively appropriately

Various perspective may considered designing interacting educational technology
examines approach
These theoretical perspective grouped three main theoretical school philosophical framework
This theoretical framework developed early century based animal learning experiment
Many psychologist used result develop theory human learning modern educator generally see one aspect holistic synthesis
Teaching behaviorism linked training emphasizing animal learning experiment
Since behaviorism consists view teaching people something reward punishment related training people
wrote extensively improvement teaching based functional analysis wrote The Technology Teaching attempt dispel myth underlying contemporary education well promote system called
developed learning system named Celeration based behavior analysis substantially differed Keller Skinner model
underwent significant change
While retaining empirical framework theory look beyond behavior explain learning considering human memory work promote learning
The Baddeley model established theoretical framework
Computer Science Information Technology major influence Cognitive Science theory
The Cognitive concept working memory formerly known short term memory long term memory facilitated research technology field Computer Science
Another major influence field Cognitive Science
Today researcher concentrating topic like
These theoretical perspective influence
Educational psychologist distinguish several type individual psychological constructivism
This form primary focus learner construct meaning new information interact reality learner bring different perspective
Constructivist learning environment require student use prior knowledge experience formulate new related adaptive concept learning Termos
Under framework role teacher becomes facilitator providing guidance learner construct knowledge
Constructivist educator must make sure prior learning experience appropriate related concept taught
Jonassen suggests learning environment useful novice learner environment useful advanced learner
Educators utilizing constructivist perspective may emphasize environment may incorporate learner centered ideally involving scenario student actively engaged critical thinking activity
An illustrative discussion example found deployment constructivist cognitive learning computer literacy involved programming instrument learning
programming language embodied attempt integrate Piagetan idea computer technology
Initially broad hopeful claim including perhaps controversial claim would improve general skill across discipline
However programming skill consistently yield cognitive benefit
It concrete advocate claimed privileged one form reasoning others difficult apply thinking activity activity
By late similar programming language lost novelty dominance gradually amid criticism
The extent assist replaces learning teaching approach variable ranging continuum none fully
A variety descriptive term employed somewhat inconsistently categorize extent technology used
For example learning may refer classroom aid laptop may refer approach traditional classroom time reduced eliminated replaced online learning
learning may describe either component hybrid approach fully online environment
may either
Synchronous learning occurs participant interacting time asynchronous learning allows participant engage exchange idea information without dependency involvement time
refers exchange idea information one participant period
Examples discussion online live teacher instruction feedback Skype conversation chat room virtual classroom everyone online working collaboratively time
Since student working collaboratively synchronized learning help student create open mind listen learn peer
Synchronized learning foster online awareness improves many student writing skill
may use technology well textbook document audio video course using
At professional educational level training may include
Asynchronous learning beneficial student health problem child care responsibility
They opportunity complete work low stress environment within flexible time frame
In online course student proceed pace

Parameters coherence value concurrent entertainment educational aspect suggested choosing medium
utilized public school United States well private school
Some environment take place traditional classroom others allow student attend class home location
There several state utilizing virtual school platform across country continue increase
For example Digital technology becoming increasingly commonplace education many researcher argue save money transform school effective institution
With technology heavy influence society doubt school looking technology teach student
Meanwhile despite debate effectiveness computerized education school proliferating nationwide enrollment online course soaring
Technology make anyone life much easier proven help student effective way
But digitized world education computer increasingly taking teacher role
Computers hear student speak example correct pronunciation evaluate progress time say Michael Kamil professor emeritus Stanford University School Education
Many expert claim digital education future
If want kid prepared life school century need consider technology basic element public education said New York Deputy Chancellor EducationJohn White
And many school making requirement take online class
Digital learning getting boost locality across nation year
For example Idaho became first state require student complete two online course receive diploma
It doubt digital education increasing educational system
enables student log course anywhere internet connection
increasingly utilized student may want go traditional brick mortar school due severe allergy medical issue fear student whose parent would like homeschool feel qualified
Online school create student receive quality education almost completely avoiding common problem
Online charter school also often limited location income level class size way brick mortar charter school
also rising supplement traditional classroom
Students special talent interest outside available curriculum use advance skill exceed grade restriction
Some online institution connect student instructor via technology form digital classroom
National private school also available online
These provide benefit student state charter online school available
They also may allow student greater flexibility exemption state testing
Virtual education often refers higher education
cyber innovative administrative model course delivery technology
Online college course enrollment seen increase enrollment nearly one third college student estimated million student currently enrolled online class
In percent student USA taking course online projected rise percent
Although large proportion higher education institution offer online class half private school
Private institution may become involved presentation cost decrease
Properly trained staff must also hired work student online
These staff member need understand content area also highly trained use computer Internet
Online education rapidly increasing online even developed leading research university
Although MOOCs may limitation preclude fully replacing college education program significantly expanded
offer class global audience college credit
program like founded offer wide range discipline charge others permit student audit course charge require small fee accreditation
MOOCs significant impact higher education declined initial expansion expected remain form
Private organization also offer class free computer science class free available via
Distributed open collaborative course DOCC see MOOC emphasizing decentralized teaching
accredited online university
offer online course
According magazine million people worldwide enrolled free online course
Companies spread use staff bring customer information latest
CPD deliver update valuable workplace skill
For effectiveness competitive learning performance scoring system designed give live feedback complex mobile learning scenario
There important need recent reliable health information made available public well summarized form public health provider
Providers indicated need automatic notification latest research single searchable portal information access
The funded screen latest research develop automatic notification provider MCH Alert
Another application public health development use mobile telecommunication multimedia global public health
MHealth used promote prenatal newborn service positive outcome
In addition Health system implemented mHealth program facilitate emergency medical response support health promotion data collection
In low middle income country mHealth frequently used text message phone reminder promote treatment adherence gather data
There also growing interest beneficial educational method student ADHD
With growing popularity among higher education opportunity take online class becoming increasingly important student age
However student ADHD special need face different learning demand compared typical developing learner
This especially significant considering dramatic rise ADHD diagnosis last decade among child adult
Compared traditional classroom virtual classroom require higher level executive function primary deficit associated ADHD
Although ADHD specifically named Rehabilitation Act student ADHD symptom interfere learning ability may eligible assistive technology
Some example resource may help interest student adult ADHD consist computer software brain game timer calendar voice recognition device screen magnifier talking book
Wolf list executive function skill necessary student succeed postsecondary education plan set goal organize initiate sustain flexibility monitor use feedback structure manage time manage material follow
These skill along strong independent learning especially pronounced online environment many ADHD student suffer deficit one executive function present significant challenge accessibility barrier current approach
Some noted current model moving towards applying constructivism learning theory emphasizes environment postulate everyone ability construct knowledge meaning process problem solving discovery
However principle constructivism may appropriate ADHD learner principle include active learning motivation strong focus
Despite limitation student special need including ADHD expressed overall enthusiasm identified number benefit including availability online course note material additional resource ability work independent pace spend extra time formulating thoughtful response class discussion help understanding course ability review lecture multiple time enhanced access communication course instructor
The design platform way enable universal access received attention several direction including WAI
WAI provides universal formatting standard website remain accessible people disability
For example developing adopting material enable accessibility people
The offer learning resource tailored visually impaired including webcasts webinars downloadable science activity online library access resource material blindness deaf blindness
Online education may appear promising alternative student physical sensory disability get work pace home
However online program equal come resource student disability
Students disability wish enroll online education must either able advocate right person willing advocate
The American Disabilities Act state online program must provide appropriate accommodation student disability specifically defined mean
Once student disability accepted online program prepare direct open need succeed expert say Haynie
Educational technology particularly online learning environment allow student use real identity pseudonym anonymous identity classroom communication
Advantages anonymizing race age gender increased student participation increased communication
Risks include increased cyberbullying aggressive hostile language
Effective technology use deploys multiple strategy concurrently
adaptive content frequent testing immediate feedback etc
effective teacher
Using computer form technology give student practice core content skill teacher work others conduct assessment perform task
Through use educational technology education able individualized student allowing better differentiation allowing student work mastery pace
Modern educational technology improve access education including full degree program
It enables better integration student particularly continuing education improved interaction student instructor
Learning material used long distance learning accessible wider audience
Course material easy access
In American family household access internet
In according Canadian Radio Television Telecommunications Commission Canada home access internet
Students access engage numerous online resource home
Using online resource Talks help student spend time specific aspect may learning school home
Schools like made certain course material free online
Although aspect classroom setting missed using resource helpful tool add additional support educational system
The necessity pay transport educational facility removed
Students appreciate convenience report greater engagement learning environment
According James Kulik study effectiveness computer used instruction student usually learn le time receiving instruction like class develop positive attitude toward computer class
Students independently solve problem
There intrinsic restriction difficulty level
student go pace
Students editing written work word processor improve quality writing
According study student better critiquing editing written work exchanged computer network student know
Studies completed computer intensive setting found increase cooperative higher order learning writing skill problem solving using technology
In addition attitude toward technology learning tool parent student teacher also improved
Employers acceptance risen time
More human resource manager surveyed August report said two candidate level experience applying job would kind effect whether candidate obtained degree acquired online traditional school
percent said employed candidate online degree past month
However said candidate get degree online seen positively job applicant traditional degree
The use educational apps generally positive effect learning
test reveal use apps mobile device reduces achievement gap struggling average student
Some educational apps improve group work allowing student receive feedback answer promoting collaboration solving problem example apps found third paragraph
The benefit learning exhibited age group
Kindergarten student use iPads show much higher rate literacy
Medical student University California Irvine utilized iPad academically reported score higher national exam previous class
Many US state spend large sum money technology
However none looking technology return investment ROI connect expenditure technology improved student outcome
New technology frequently accompanied unrealistic hype promise regarding transformative power change education better allowing better educational opportunity reach mass
Examples include silent film broadcast radio television none maintained much foothold daily practice mainstream formal education
Technology necessarily result fundamental improvement educational practice
The focus need learner interaction technology
It need recognized ecological rather additive subtractive
In ecological change one significant change create total change
According Branford et technology guarantee effective learning inappropriate use technology even hinder
A University Washington study infant vocabulary show slipping due educational baby DVDs
Published Journal Pediatrics University Washington study vocabulary baby surveyed parent Washington Minnesota
The study found every one hour baby month age watched DVDs Videos knew fewer common baby word baby watch
Andrew Meltzoff surveyor study state result make sense baby time spent front DVDs TV instead people speaking baby going get linguistic experience
Dimitri Chistakis another surveyor reported evidence mounting baby DVDs value may harmful
Adaptive instructional material tailor question student ability calculate score encourages student work individually rather socially collaboratively Kruse
Social relationship important environment may compromise balance trust care respect teacher student
MOOCs although quite popular discussion technology education developed country US major concern developing country
One stated goal MOOCs provide le fortunate population developing country opportunity experience course content structure
However research show registrant country although many course thousand registered student complete course
MOOCs also implies certain curriculum teaching method superior could eventually wash possibly washing local educational institution cultural norm educational tradition
With Internet social medium using educational apps make student highly susceptible distraction sidetracking
Even though proper use shown increase student performance distracted would detrimental
Another disadvantage increased potential cheating
Smartphones easy hide use inconspicuously especially use normalized classroom
These disadvantage managed strict rule regulation mobile phone use
Electronic device cellphone computer facilitate rapid access stream source may receive cursory attention
Michel Rich associate professor Harvard Medical School executive director center Media Child Health Boston said digital generation Their brain rewarded staying task jumping next thing
The worry raising generation kid front screen whose brain going wired differently
Students always faced distraction computer cellphone particular challenge stream data interfere focusing learning
Although technology affect adult young people may influenced developing brain easily become habituated switching task become unaccustomed sustaining attention
Too much information coming rapidly overwhelm thinking
Technology rapidly profoundly altering brain
High exposure level stimulate brain cell alteration release neurotransmitter cause strengthening neural pathway weakening others
This lead heightened stress level brain first boost energy level time actually augment memory impair cognition lead depression alter neural circuitry hippocampus amygdala prefrontal cortex
These brain region control mood thought
If unchecked underlying structure brain could altered
due technology may begin young
When child exposed age seven important developmental task may delayed bad learning habit might develop deprives child exploration play need develop
Media psychology emerging specialty field embrace electronic device sensory behavior occurring use educational technology learning
According Lai learning environment complex system interplay interaction many thing impact outcome learning
When technology brought educational setting pedagogical setting change teaching change entire meaning activity without adequate research validation
If technology monopolizes activity student begin develop sense life would scarcely thinkable without technology
Leo Marx considered word technology problematic susceptible reification phantom objectivity conceals fundamental nature something valuable insofar benefit human condition
Technology ultimately come affecting relation people notion obfuscated technology treated abstract notion devoid good evil
Langdon Winner make similar point arguing underdevelopment philosophy technology leaf u overly simplistic reduction discourse supposedly dichotomous notion making versus us new technology narrow focus use lead u believe technology neutral moral standing
These critique would u ask How maximize role advancement technology education
rather What social human consequence adopting particular technology
Winner viewed technology form life aid human activity also represents powerful force reshaping activity meaning
For example use robot industrial workplace may increase productivity also radically change process production thereby redefining meant work setting
In education standardized testing arguably redefined notion learning assessment
We rarely explicitly reflect strange notion number say could accurately reflect person knowledge world
According Winner recurring pattern everyday life tend become unconscious process learn take granted
Winner writes By far greatest latitude choice exists first time particular instrument system technique introduced
Because choice tend become strongly fixed material equipment economic investment social habit original flexibility vanishes practical purpose initial commitment made
In sense technological innovation similar legislative act political founding establish framework public order endure many generation
When adopting new technology may one best chance get right
Seymour Papert point good example bad choice become strongly fixed social habit material equipment choice use QWERTY keyboard
The QWERTY arrangement letter keyboard originally chosen efficient typing early typewriter prone jam adjacent key struck quick succession
Now typing become digital process longer issue QWERTY arrangement life social habit one difficult change
Neil Postman endorsed notion technology impact human culture including culture classroom consideration even important considering efficiency new technology tool teaching
Regarding computer impact education Postman writes What need consider computer nothing efficiency teaching tool
We need know way altering conception learning conjunction television undermines old idea school
There assumption technology inherently interesting must helpful education based research Daniel Willingham always case
He argues necessarily matter technological medium whether content engaging utilizes medium beneficial way
The concept gap access digital technology
Access may associated age gender status education income ethnicity geography
According report large amount personal data child collected electronic device distributed school United States
Often far information necessary collected uploaded stored indefinitely
Aside name date birth information include child browsing history search term location data contact list well behavioral information
Parents informed informed little choice
According report constant surveillance resulting educational technology warp child privacy expectation lead limit creativity
Since technology end goal education rather mean accomplished educator must good grasp technology advantage disadvantage
Teacher training aim effective integration classroom technology
The evolving nature technology may unsettle teacher may experience perpetual novice
Finding quality material support classroom objective often difficult
Random professional development day inadequate
According Jenkins Rather dealing technology isolation would better take ecological approach thinking interrelationship among different communication technology cultural community grow around activity support
Jenkins also suggested traditional school curriculum guided teacher train student autonomous problem solver
However today worker increasingly asked work team drawing different set expertise collaborating solve problem
Learning style method collecting information evolved student often feel locked world described textbook depersonalized abstract prose used describe
These century skill attained incorporation engagement technology
Changes instruction use technology also promote higher level learning among student different type intelligence
There two distinct issue assessment assessment educational technology assessment technology
Assessments educational technology included project
technology may either
Instructors use type assessment understand student progress learning classroom
Technology helped teacher create better assessment help understand student trouble material issue
Formative assessment difficult perfect form ongoing allows student show learning different way depending
Technology helped teacher make formative assessment better particularly use classroom response system CRS
A CRS tool student handheld device partner teacher computer
The instructor asks multiple choice true false question student answer device
Depending software used answer may shown graph student teacher see percentage student gave answer teacher focus went wrong
Some example CRSs Quizzler Turning Systems quiz aspect Mastering Programs example Mastering Physics Mastering Chemistry
Summative assessment common classroom usually set easily graded take form test project specific grading scheme
One huge benefit testing option give student immediate feedback answer
When student get response able know class help push improve give confidence well
Technology also allows different kind summative assessment digital presentation video anything else may come allows different learner show learned effectively
Teachers also use technology post graded assessment online student better idea good project

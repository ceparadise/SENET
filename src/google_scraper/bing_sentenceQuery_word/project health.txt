After year performed successful transition planned economy
Along change China healthcare system also experienced significant reform follow adapt historical revolution
In data released MoH indicated national expenditure billion totally accounted nationwide gross domestic product
Before entire healthcare cost covered central government annual budget
Since construct supporter started change gradually
Most expenditure contributed health insurance scheme private spending corresponded total expenditure respectively
Meanwhile financially governmental contribution decreased
On hand healthcare facility recorded statistic summary MoH average clinical bed per people mentioned well
Along development information technology since healthcare provider realised information could generate significant benefit improve service computerised case data instance gaining information directing patient care assessing best patient care specific clinical condition
Therefore substantial resource collected build China health informatics system
Most resource arranged construct HIS aimed minimise unnecessary waste repetition subsequently promote efficiency healthcare
By China successfully spread HIS approximately nationwide hospital

In conclusion agreed strongly agreed providing health information Internet utilized
Collected information different time different participant system could frequently lead issue misunderstanding
To design system healthcare provider realised certain standard basis sharing information interoperability however system lacking standard would large impediment interfere improvement corresponding information system
Given standardisation health informatics depends authority standardisation event must involved government subsequently relevant funding support critical
In Ministry Health released Development National Health Informatics indicating identification standardisation health informatics adoption international standard development national standard
In China establishment standardisation initially facilitated development vocabulary conducive reserve transmit information premium management national level
By domestic standard vocabulary classification coding served hospital information system
In revision International Statistical Classification Diseases Related Health Problems adopted standard diagnostic classification acute care procedure classification
Simultaneously ICPC translated tested China local applied environment
Another coding standard named LOINC applied serve general identifier clinical observation hospital
Personal identifier code widely employed different information system involving name sex nationality family relationship educational level job occupation
However code within different system inconsistent sharing different region
Considering large quantity vocabulary classification coding standard different jurisdiction healthcare provider realised using multiple system could generate issue resource wasting national level standard beneficial necessary
Therefore late health informatics group Ministry Health released three project deal issue lacking national health information standard Chinese National Health Information Framework Standardisation Basic Data Set Standards Hospital Information System Basic Data Set Standards Public Health Information System
Recently researcher local university evaluated performance China EHR Standard compared Standard Practice Content Structure Electronic Health Records United States E Standard

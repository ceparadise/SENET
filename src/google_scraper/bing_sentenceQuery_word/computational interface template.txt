Theoretical investigation formation patterning synaptic connection morphology still nascent
One hypothesis recently garnered attention postulate formation axon dendrite effectively minimizes resource allocation maintaining maximal information storage
Early model sensory processing understood within theoretical framework credited
Somewhat similar minimal wiring hypothesis described preceding section Barlow understood processing early sensory system form neuron encoded information minimized number spike
Experimental computational work since supported hypothesis one form another
Current research sensory processing divided among biophysical modelling different subsystem theoretical modelling perception

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Suppose I working scientific code
In recent discussion colleague argued expression template could really bad thing potentially making software compilable certain version gcc
Supposedly problem affected scientific code alluded subtitle
These example I know hence link
However people argued expression template useful yield performance gain avoiding storage intermediate result temporary variable
I know whole lot template metaprogramming I know one approach used automatic differentiation interval arithmetic I got discussion expression template
Given potential advantage performance potential disadvantage maintenance even right word I use expression template computational science I avoid
My problem expression template leaky abstraction
You spend lot work writing complicated code simple task nicer syntax
But want change algorithm mess dirty code slip type syntax get completely unintelligible error message
If application map perfectly library based expression template might worth considering sure I would recommend writing normal code
Sure high level code le pretty need done
As benefit compilation time binary size go way wo cope huge variance performance due compiler compilation flag choice
Others commented issue difficult write ET program well complexity understanding error message
Let comment issue compiler It true back one big issue finding compiler compliant enough standard make everything work make work portably
As consequence found lot bug I bug report name distributed gcc Intel icc IBM xlC Portland pgicc
Consequently configuration script repository large number compiler bug test primarily area template friend declaration namespaces etc
But turn compiler maker really gotten act together today gcc icc today pas test easy write code portable two
I would say PGI far behind number quirk seem go away year
xlC hand whole different story fix bug every month despite filing bug report year progress extremely slow xlC never able compile successfully
What mean stick two big compiler expect work today
Since computer OSs today typically least one enough
The platform thing difficult BlueGene system compiler typically xlC bug
I experimented little bit ET long time ago mentioned compiler still struggling
I used library linear algebra code mine
The problem getting good compiler I perfect programmer interpreting compiler error message
The latter simply unmanageable
The compiler would average generate line error message
No way I able quickly find programming error
You find information webpage proceeding two ET workshop
But I would stay far away
The problem already start term template ET
I know precise definition
But common usage somehow couple code linear algebra expression get computed
For example You code vector operation And get computed loop In opinion two different thing need decoupled interface one possible implementation
I mean common practice programming
Sure might good default implementation general I want able utilize specialized dedicated implementation
For instance I want function like get called I coding
Maybe us internally loop like
But depending vector size implementation might efficient
Anyway expert high performance implement tune much possible
So mapped call I rather avoid syntactic sugar directly call right away
What I describe nothing new
On contrary idea behind If scope BLAS sufficient
provide function like one extend scope BLAS
So dinosaur realizes stone age tool clean orthogonal separation interface implementation
It kind funny numerical library achieve level software quality
Although programming language much sophisticated
So surprise still alive actively developed
So opinion ETs evil per se
But commonly used numerical library earned bad reputation scientific computing circle
By posting answer agree

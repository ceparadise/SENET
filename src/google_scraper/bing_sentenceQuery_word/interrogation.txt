An law enforcement representative agency collect information crime questioning suspect victim witness
The ultimate goal interrogation solve crime
An interrogation suspect last minute several hour
An important factor interrogation law enforcement agent continue questioning suspect ask lawyer right
Additionally law enforcement agent allowed use cruel unusual punishment interrogation
Cruel unusual punishment includes using physical force detained suspect
Getting suspect answer question interrogation challenging law enforcement agent use lawful technique completing interrogation
Officer Smith option using different interrogation technique
The common technique known
The following nine step part technique
All evidence provided suspect police officer giving suspect chance confess immediately
Officer Smith tell Dave neighbor saw hit wife wife bruise arm
Officer Smith also show Dave picture hand print wife face tell Dave match hand print picture Dave hand
If work officer move next step dominance
The law enforcement agent let suspect talk
Since Dave speaking Officer Smith able continue talking without interrupted
Office Smith offer different scenario
A Dave hit wife
He helping falling grabbed keep hitting ground
B Dave upset flung hand hit accident
C The domestic violence accident Dave moment rage really meant hit wife
Dave still speaking
He admitting denying scenario Officer Smith given
Since dominance working officer use deflection
Officer Smith try give moral justification Dave hit wife
Deflection also known theme change throughout interview depending suspect answer question
Officer Smith creates theme using scenario dominance step
Officer Smith justifies Dave action correct help wife falling
He also justifies Dave hitting wife creating theme accident around
She either falling flailing hand walked
Officer Smith also us victim blaming saying Dave mad come close Dave time rage
She would hit walked away
Dave finally start talk object theme
These objection give Officer Smith opportunity turn objection justification domestic violence
Dave tell Officer Smith hit woman wrong violent person I would hit anyone
Officer Smith take objection justifies domestic violence
Officer Smith say really want hit wife
violent wife got way hit
Officer Smith able get Dave answer either justification question started showing empathy Dave
Officer Smith express empathy Dave
He tell Dave understands going get irritated wife
Officer Smith say Dave wife would argued would hurt
Dave remains silent chooses speak Officer Smith expressed empathy
Officer Smith move next step Reid technique create alternative theme
Dave unresponsive empathy step
He answer Officer Smith question Officer Smith offer different theme different scenario
This time creating scenario Officer Smith focus Dave duty society
Officer Smith say confess afraid lose job able see kid
Officer Smith say hit wife man house want lose control
Dave becomes responsive scenario losing job child
He nod head Officer Smith first admission guilt
Officer Smith continues questioning posing alternative question Dave child job
Posing alternative question mean Officer Smith ask Dave losing job child
He say Dave afraid lose job child speak confess hitting wife
Dave responds hit wife really mean
I want lose child
Dave admits guilt Officer Smith must repeat confession front member agency
Should Dave confessed step interrogation Officer Smith could asked Dave repeat confession
Officer Smith could skipped step Reid technique moved repetition documentation
This final stage Reid technique interrogating suspect
Documentation includes documenting date time suspect confessed confession written suspect sign confession making legal
Dave would write confession sign statement
Another technique used interrogate suspect complete interview
Get FREE access day create account
suspect one type interrogation
Law enforcement agent interview suspect systematic approach
First plan prepare question engage suspect explain
The third step interview account happened
The officer put together statement victim witness tell suspect belief happened
The fourth step close interview final step evaluate response given suspect
While Dave cell Officer Smith could planned interview Dave
Officer Smith would ask pertinent question crime
He would explain Dave detained
Then Officer Smith would recount event best possible using information obtained victim witness
While Officer Smith going step Dave would document Dave answer Dave body language
He would close interview take time evaluate answer
He would also ask Dave clarify information question
An alternative interviewing suspect verbal aggression
sound
It intense uncomfortable suspect
Officer Smith would yell Dave use verbal force asking question
He would repeat question time getting closer louder without touching Dave
The force negativity Officer Smith us enough get Dave confess crime
There different way law enforcement agent interrogate suspect
If suspect custody know interrogation suspect custody type interrogation interrogation
In example Officer Smith enough evidence arrest Dave domestic violence
Dave custody domestic violence committed wife
If enough evidence Dave Officer Smith could question Dave would take custody would read Miranda right
Dave would asked voluntarily give statement answer question obligated stay answer question
Interrogating suspect difficult task
The suspect know trouble confessed crime one law enforcement agency responsibility get suspect confess
There several technique interrogator use suspect
If suspect custody Dave suspect would Miranda right read
If suspect custody asked voluntarily give statement
In end law enforcement agent hoping confession suspect information victim witness solve crime

Jane car accident two officer arrive scene suspect may influence driving
As result take Jane police station questioning accident
When Jane police arrive station placed room officer begin
A happens one law enforcement officer question someone detained
Keep mind although Jane arrested leave police station
Since freedom taken away
A custodial interrogation often conducted person connected crime
Since Jane room officer custody read Miranda right
We discus right explore case involve custodial interrogation
One first known case concerning custodial interrogation involved
Many probably heard Miranda warning let look exactly precedent set case
The case decided actually started Ernesto Miranda taken home police station subsequently questioned several hour police
During interrogation officer inform Miranda constitutional right relation detention
In course interrogation Miranda gave written oral confession later used prosecute kidnapping rape
Miranda successfully appealed conviction Supreme Court ruled individual custodial interrogation must informed right
These right include In deciding Miranda case Supreme Court also ruled evidence confession obtained interrogation taking place admissible person questioned received Miranda warning
We also note considering court used information three case set precedent mandated necessity providing Miranda warning custodial interrogation
These case included In case much like one involving Ernesto Miranda complainant detained interrogated without knowing right
However Supreme Court yet decide point detainment Miranda warning issued individual actually custodial interrogation
The case helped settle issue
In Robert Stansbury questioned police kidnapping rape child
The police interested Stansbury drove truck contact child day disappeared
Police collected evidence case eyewitness saw man turquoise car throw something body water
Stansbury admitted talking child even admitted drove roommate turquoise car
At point officer read Stansbury Miranda warning placed arrest
Prior Stansbury mentioning car custodial interrogation
The point interrogation turned custodial interrogation mentioned car
Stansbury free leave point
Get FREE access day create account
Stansbury convicted information obtained including statement Stansbury made prior receiving Miranda warning used convict
Before trial started Stansbury filed motion asking statement removed evidence
His motion denied according court Stansbury custody time statement made
The Supreme Court looked four factor case ruling custodial interrogation actually start
Those four factor In case Supreme Court ruled officer focused Stansbury suspect talked turquoise car
It ruled officer could use statement made prior issuing Miranda warning Stansbury suspect point mentioned turquoise car
Custodial interrogation begin person detained
While person detained lost freedom leave arrested
Throughout judicial history case Supreme Court decide suspect right violated
For example case decided individual custodial interrogation must advised right include right remain silent right attorney even afford one
The Supreme Court decide officer actually started custodial interrogation
gave chance make call
Here Supreme Court defined four factor helped determine custodial interrogation begin including focus length site type interrogation
They also decided information admissible court prior issuing Miranda warning detail provided individual actually suspect

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Integration harder achieve greater number system involved company often choose external contractor manage phase development new system
Specific activity IT system integration include design process account free flow data information delivery
Challenges achieving integration mostly inherent difficulty linking series diverse existing system could produced multiple different manufacturer
Other integration challenge lack coherent unifying data structure linking different system unwieldy framework multiple different application support system sheer age different system actual delivery information key business unit need
These integration challenge hinder overall process efficiency poor data exchange system prevents quick communication among business unit
Because integration difficult achieve common practice employ strategy objective slowly build towards full integration linking various subsystem necessary
These link usually established component process control layer system promote free flow data across system
As system linked business management control layer connected system sharing data
Companies strive integrate system component business help streamline marketing sale process organizing updating customer information hope deepening customer relationship boosting revenue growth
A main goal integrating CRM system smaller system prevent manual data entry save employee time removing redundant unnecessary tedious everyday step
For example company might integrate website marketing automation software bring customer information directly CRM system
Any action prospect take website logged new record automatically created system
Other us CRM integration include integrating email system CRM automatically importing basic customer information name company email address phone number email CRM facilitate contact log record interaction
Integration CRM system key component company must make product compatible multiple different existing product cater customer maximize reach applicability
This often involves altering new product match existing product code integration take place
Integration product development also refers process separately produced component subsystem combined problem interaction addressed
Companies often strive integrate CRM system legacy accounting system order link financial information assist customer service

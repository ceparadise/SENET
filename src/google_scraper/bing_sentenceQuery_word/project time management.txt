A successful must simultaneously manage four basic element project
These element interrelated must managed together project project manager successful
The project scope definition project supposed accomplish budget time money created achieve objective
It imperative change scope project matching change budget time resource
If project scope build building house three widget budget project manager expected
However scope changed building four widget project manager must obtain appropriate change time money resource
There aspect understanding managing resource A successful Project Manager resource assigned project including vendor staff subcontractor
You must ensure employee skill tool need complete job must continually monitor whether enough people place complete project deadline
It job ensure person understands task project deadline
When manage direct employee senior member group employee report
Employees also may line manager provides technical direction
In matrix management situation like project team job provide project direction line manager
Managing labor subcontract usually mean managing team lead subcontracted worker turn manage worker
A project manager often must procure equipment material manage use team operates efficiently
You responsible appropriate equipment material correct location proper time
There element successful time management Build project schedule listing order task need completed must done sequentially others overlap done tandem
Assign duration task
Allocate required resource
Determine predecessor task must completed successor task ca start task
Project management software simplify task creating managing project schedule
Some task little flexibility required start finish date
It called float
Other task flexibility zero float
A line task zero float called critical path
All task path multiple parallel path must completed time project completed time
The Project Manager key time management task manage critical path
There consideration managing money Each task cost whether cost labor hour computer programmer purchase price cubic yard concrete
In preparing cost estimated totaled
Some estimate accurate others
Thus project budget include contingency allowance
It money set aside budget case actual cost item wildly different estimate
Profit money company want make task
It put top cost
So project budget composed estimated cost plus contingency plus profit
The project manager job keep actual cost estimated cost maximize profit company earns project
Successful project management art science take practice
The idea presented give basic understanding project management consider beginning
If job career path includes project management want improve skill talk successful project manager read practice
Project management rewarding career

Time terrible resource waste
This valuable resource project
Every delivery supposed make
Therefore without proper time management project head towards disaster
When come project time management time project manager time management project team
Scheduling easiest way managing project time
In approach activity project estimated duration determined based resource utilization activity
In addition estimate resource allocation cost always play vital role time management
This due fact schedule quite expensive
Following main step project time management process
Each address distinct area time management project
When come project level identifying activity
First requirement broken task deliverable
Then based task granularity broken activity presented form WBS Work Breakdown Structure
In order manage project time critical identify activity sequence
The activity identified previous step sequenced based execution order
When sequencing activity interdependency considered
The estimation amount type resource required activity done step
Depending number resource allocated activity duration varies
Therefore project management team clear understanding resource allocation order accurately manage project time
This one key step project planning process
Since estimate time duration step completed higher accuracy
For step many estimation mechanism place project select appropriate one
Most company follow either WBS based estimating Function Points based estimate step
Once activity estimate completed critical path project identified order determine total project duration
This one key input project time management
In order create accurate schedule parameter previous step required
Activity sequence duration activity resource activity important factor
In case perform step manually may end wasting lot valuable project planning time
There many software package Microsoft Project assist develop reliable accurate project schedule
As part schedule develop Gantt chart order visually monitor activity milestone
No project practical world executed without change original schedule
Therefore essential update project schedule ongoing change
Time management key responsibility project manager
The project manager equip strong skill sense time management
There number time management technique integrated management theory best practice

Project management technique stage critical getting complex project completed time budget
While project management often brushed task certification Project Manager basic project management practice make overall management large project easier effective
This article explores different stage method project management together implementation example
Even though sort project management used century project management became formally recognized distinct general idea management Cleland
Project size vary widely world engineering range large project like successfully placing satellite orbit simple Arduino project
Regardless size project undertaken necessary engineer designer behind task solid understanding project management concept
The first question answered What project management Project management application knowledge skill tool technique project activity meet project PMI
The set skill tool technique absolute depends stakeholder project type project life cycle several variable
Why care project management technique relatively small sometimes personal project
It without management risk failure increase considerably
Without proper risk assessment contingency plan time wasted trying find solution problem could prevented better handled proper planning
For example developing system several part care must taken ensure compatibility part must backup plan certain part prove incompatible
Should compatibility issue arise contingency plan lacking time wasted researching new part expense allotted project phase
This could delay whole product increase cost unnecessarily
If project manager lack clear understanding people affected project project likely properly satisfy target audience
The list go
No matter project size form management necessary minimize chance failure poor management technique
The project manager person responsibility planning executing closing given project
In addition responsible ensuring everyone team executes assigned role properly managing task developing project budget schedule
It common project manager obtain professional certification various organization Project Management Institute PMI university
The training process project manager could formal online even via project management simulation
analyzing real project evaluating possible outcome decision
The content training program either office often cover industry standard professional standard private standard
standard employed organization question necessarily widely known accepted software tool like Project
A stakeholder project person group either actively involved executing project question somehow impacted final product
This could anyone project manager customer
The customer always stakeholder oftentimes important
All project end delivering final product ensure end requirement met well possible
In engineering success measured quality case project depends heavily proper management project life cycle
A project life cycle refers phase project undergoes conception idea completion maintenance marketing retirement market Maley
While many model showing project life cycle care must taken ensure chosen model properly reflects type product question make management easier accurate
For project incremental model serf excellent model provided project manager invested keeping project alive
This model focus iterating design process analysis problem statement final delivery shown Figure making necessary incremental improvement
This method observed large software company keep releasing frequent patch update
Figure Project Life Cycle Incremental Method
Source Maley
Another popular model Waterfall Model Linear Sequential Development Model
A core feature Waterfall Model Figure next stage initiated without completion previous stage
This often found software development though discouraged believe software never truly finished development
Figure Project Life Cycle Waterfall Model
Source Maley
Regardless method chosen important project manager realizes project undergo change throughout lifecycle chosen method make relatively easy go make change project
This model general constraint project management prof applicable various scale one analyze project goal make decision based information available
The three constraint make triangle Figure scope time cost
Figure The Iron Triangle Project Management
Proper documentation project life cycle development process essential future analysis modification
Even environment one person working project much easier review one work clear documentation exists
For working team however imperative proper coordinated documentation project
The focused personalization improvement home automation
Even fairly small scale project project management essential many level

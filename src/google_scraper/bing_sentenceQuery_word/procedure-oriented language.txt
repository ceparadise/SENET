Procedural programming natural way telling computer computer processor language machine code procedural
It also referred structured modular programming
Procedural programming performed telling computer list instruction
Therefore procedural programming involves procedure implies step need followed complete specific task
For example read number add display specific message
Procedural programming quite straightforward efficient often begin program written common plain language applying logic actually writing code
The main feature procedural programming relatively easy read write program code maintain program code numerous procedure debugged separately
Furthermore large program divided smaller one data shared therefore reached point within program
Conclusively taking account main characteristic procedural programing sequential logic simplicity easy implementation compiler interpreter ability make use code program calling instead copying ease program flow tracked ability strongly modular structured definitely said procedural programming essential stepping stone towards learning programming skill
An algorithm defined set step performing task written implemented

Applying correct syntax essential done properly program wo run
The syntax language greatly affect easy write read understand program
Syntax error usually occur program statement conform rule language
Therefore Syntax error occur parsing input code result grammatically incorrect statement
Some example syntax error misspelled keywords unmatched quotation mark missing semicolon illegal character input missing operator two operator row two statement line intervening semicolon unbalanced parenthesis misplaced reserved word etc
Semantic error occur form element statement correct element valid use
Semantic error normally detected compile time
Semantic error occur execution code parsed grammatically correct
These error statement constructed mean
Regular example sematic error thing incorrect variable type size variable subscript range specifying wrong number argument function using numeric variable name character variable valid reference

Paul PhD University British Columbia taught Geographic Information Systems statistic computer programming year
Programming creative process carried programmer instruct computer task
A program set instruction tell computer order come solution particular problem
There number alternative approach programming process referred
Different paradigm represent fundamentally different approach building solution specific type problem using programming
Most programming language fall one paradigm language element multiple paradigm
Two important programming paradigm procedural paradigm paradigm
Let look bit detail
us list instruction tell computer
Procedural programming relies guessed procedure also known routine subroutine
A procedure contains series computational step carried
Procedural programming also referred imperative programming
Procedural programming language also known language
Procedural programming intuitive sense similar would expect program work
If want computer something provide instruction
It therefore surprise early programming language procedural
Examples procedural language include Fortran COBOL C around since
approach computation carried using object
An component program know perform certain action interact element program
Objects basic unit programming
A simple example object would person
Logically would expect person name
This would considered property person
You would also expect person able something walking
This would considered method person
A method programming like procedure procedural programming
The key difference method part object
In programming organize code creating object give object property make certain thing
A key aspect programming use class
A class blueprint object
You think class concept object embodiment concept
So let say want use person program
You want able describe person person something
A class called would provide blueprint person look like person
Examples language include C Java Perl Python
One important characteristic procedural programming relies procedure operate data two separate concept
In programming two concept bundled object
This make possible create complicated behavior le code
The use object also make possible reuse code
Once created object complex behavior use anywhere code
Let look simple example
You want write program play song
Your band playing song four member start giving name myband Now band time pick song mysong Submarine Now want band play song need two thing
First need lyric note song
Second band member need know perform vocal play particular instrument
We consider first requirement
Get FREE access day create account
In procedural programming need include text note program band member play
However want another band play song another program
In procedural programming could copy paste code another program need manually type text
However save text separate file every time band band matter want play song simply call file
That way code song never need get duplicated
This exactly programming
In technical term would use class called create object Submarine
This object number property including lyric music note
The class describes organize lyric music note read band member
Other song similar organization different lyric music note
When write program band play song would call object Submarine band member access lyric music note
In programming still write lyric music note song band use lyric music time
From every program call object play song
And song organized similar manner one band play song without change code much
programming become dominant programming paradigm today software development
Most newer programming language developed past year
However mean paradigm gone away procedural programming language still widely used
Some language combine element paradigm
For example widely used language derived language C procedural language
component added C become therefore procedural language
Different represent fundamentally different approach building solution specific type problem
Two important programming paradigm procedural programming programming
us detailed list instruction tell computer
In organize code creating give object property make certain thing
programming become dominant programming paradigm today software development procedural programming language still widely used

Computer programming language important part computer science every major technological development recent time
They used create form function everything use including smartphones electronics website
As programmer become skilled adept writing program quality intelligence technological device engage continue improve language computer science continue evolve
To learn checkout infographic created University Florida program
Related program Copy paste text include infographic website
Websites innovative responsive offer host feature function immaculately designed using one combination today popular programming language
These programming language include C JAVA JAVASCRIPT PHP RUBY Objective C Python
C used foundational programming language many newer language based
The language used building improving website work allowing dynamic page feature overall design
Popular website apps currently using programming language one form another include Google Bloomberg GoToMeeting app The Wall Street Journal Java Facebook Twitter JavaScript Yahoo Wikipedia PHP Groupon Amazon Ruby iPhone apps YouTube NASA Python
Of course domain outside website programming language also featured heavily
These domain include framework computer science department laboratory
The top
Universities Computer Science department use Python Java Matlab C programming language power operation
On hand world popular technology use JavaScript SQL Java C PHP Python C power device
Computer programmer often work developer number different area capacity
These range area far programmer web developer area least database administrator
Other area include descending order student web developer mobile developer desktop developer web developer embedded app developer enterprise level developer executive cio cto etc system administrator
The projected period growth marked future computer programming software period
It expected period growth computer occupation namely software development computer programmer take place total rate
Software developer expected move approximately developer
Similarly computer programmer expected increase number approximately
Open source one used platform programming developmental technology today trajectory likely continue upward
Since point shift company creating software client using open source moving company
It surprising therefore expected company developer expected increase contribution open source project within next year
In addition growth open source project software developed also emergence new improved powerful programming language
Apple Swift successor likely take front row center next year already risen Redmonk language ranking
Google Galang open source cloud development language also expected increase popularity usage move forward
Importantly new drag n drop technology also available programmer
Thanks language like MIT Scratch Code Studio Google Blockly programmer able build code project without heavily relying code
They build program simply dragging dropping block
This development currently emerging likely developed perfected next year
Finally responsive design challenge programmer likely continue meet head
This technological market continue demand program device vary size
From eyewear Google Glass watch Apple watch programmer continue build program design system able fit variety screen size consumer need

derived based upon concept
Procedures also known routine function confused mathematical function similar used simply contain series computational step carried
Any given procedure might called point program execution including procedure
The first major procedural programming language first appeared circa including
published closer released example modern procedural language first published provide hardware support procedural programming instruction returning
Hardware support type programming possible attempt commercially successful example
generally desirable especially large complicated program
Inputs usually specified syntactically form output delivered
another technique help keep procedure modular
It prevents procedure accessing variable procedure vice versa including previous instance without explicit authorization
Less modular procedure often used small quickly written program tend interact large number execution procedure might also modify
Because ability specify simple interface reused procedure convenient vehicle making piece code written different people different group including
Procedural programming language also language make explicit reference state execution environment
This could anything may correspond something like position turtle
Often term procedural programming imperative programming used synonymously
However procedural programming relies heavily whereas imperative programming whole may may feature
As procedural language generally use reserved word act block implement whereas imperative language use statement purpose
The focus procedural programming break programming task collection whereas break programming task object expose behavior method data member attribute using interface
The important distinction procedural programming us procedure operate data structure programming bundle two together object instance class operates data structure
The first major programming language built ground Java
Nomenclature varies two although similar semantics The principle modularity code reuse practical language fundamentally procedural language since stem
So example The main difference style functional programming language remove least deemphasize imperative element procedural programming
The feature set functional language therefore designed support writing program much possible term pure function Many functional language however fact impurely functional offer construct allow programmer write program procedural style combination style
It common code functional language written procedural style
There exist functional language like eschew precept sake difficult program therefore challenging
These language exception common ground procedural functional language
In program set premise computation performed attempting prove candidate theorem
From point view logic program focusing problem rather solve
However technique implemented used solve problem logic programming language treat program procedure
Thus clause form dual interpretation procedure logical implication Experienced logic programmer use procedural interpretation write program effective efficient use declarative interpretation help ensure program correct

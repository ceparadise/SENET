used design new software test evaluate quality existing software test
Mutation testing involves modifying program small way
Each mutated version called test detect reject mutant causing behavior original version differ mutant
This called mutant
Test suite measured percentage mutant kill
New test designed kill additional mutant
Mutants based either mimic typical programming error using wrong operator variable name force creation valuable test dividing expression zero
The purpose help tester develop effective test locate weakness test data used program section code seldom never accessed
Mutation testing form
Most article program mutation program modified
A general definition using rule defined syntactic structure make systematic change software artifact
Mutation analysis applied problem usually applied testing
So defined using mutation analysis design new software test evaluate existing software test
Thus mutation analysis testing applied design model specification database test XML type software artifact although program mutation common
Tests created verify correctness implementation given software system creation test still pose question whether test correct sufficiently cover requirement originated implementation
This technological problem instance deeper philosophical problem named Who guard guard
In context mutation testing pioneered locate expose weakness
The theory mutant introduced without behavior generally program affected indicated either code mutated never executed dead code test suite unable locate fault represented mutant
For function scale large number mutant usually introduced large program leading compilation execution extremely large number copy program
This problem expense mutation testing reduced practical use method software testing increased use framework led creation mutation testing tool many programming language way test individual portion application
Mutation testing originally proposed Richard Lipton student first developed published DeMillo Lipton Sayward
The first implementation mutation testing tool part work titled
Recently availability massive computing power resurgence mutation analysis within computer science community work done define method applying mutation testing
In company called Certess part extended many principle hardware verification domain
Whereas mutation analysis expects detect difference output produced Certess extends verifying checker testbench actually detect difference
This extension mean three stage verification namely activation propagation detection evaluated
They called functional qualification
considered special case mutation testing
In fuzzing message data exchanged inside communication interface inside software instance mutated catch failure difference processing data
evolved concept fully stateful mutation testing platform complete monitor thoroughly exercising protocol implementation
Mutation testing based two hypothesis
The first hypothesis
This hypothesis state software fault introduced experienced programmer due small syntactic error
The second hypothesis called
The coupling effect asserts simple fault cascade form emergent fault
Subtle important fault also revealed mutant support coupling effect
mutant enabled creating mutant one mutation
Mutation testing done selecting set mutation operator applying source program one time applicable piece source code
The result applying one mutation operator program called
If test suite able detect change
one test fails mutant said
For example consider following code fragment The condition mutation operator would replace produce following mutant Now test kill mutant following three condition met These condition collectively called
requires first second condition satisfied
requires three condition satisfied
Strong mutation powerful since ensures test suite really catch problem
Weak mutation closely related method
It requires much le computing power ensure test suite satisfies weak mutation testing strong mutation testing
However case possible find test case could kill mutant
The resulting program behaviorally equivalent original one
Such mutant called
Equivalent mutant detection one biggest obstacle practical usage mutation testing
The effort needed check mutant equivalent high even small program
A systematic literature review wide range approach overcome Equivalent Mutant Problem presented identified relevant technique article three category technique detecting DEM suggesting SEM avoiding equivalent mutant generation AEMG
The experiment indicated Higher Order Mutation general JudyDiffOp strategy particular provide promising approach Equivalent Mutant Problem
Many mutation operator explored researcher
Here example mutation operator imperative language These mutation operator also called traditional mutation operator
There also mutation operator language concurrent construction complex object like container etc
Operators container called mutation operator
For example muJava tool offer various mutation operator Access Modifier Change Type Cast Operator Insertion Type Cast Operator Deletion
Mutation operator also developed perform security vulnerability testing program

Determine gene mutation cause genetic disease others
Teisha Rowland PhD Science Buddies Sandra Slutz PhD Science Buddies The Human Genome Project estimated human genome contains around
Each gene made hundred million nucleotide
Sometimes single DNA change DNA sequence cause person devastating researcher able identify mutation responsible causing thousand different genetic disease condition
But sometimes DNA mutation may harm
It DNA mutation located
Every gene human body consists DNA deoxyribonucleic acid
DNA genetic code made four different type adenine A thymine T guanine G cytosine C
This DNA code turned ribonucleic acid body process called
In RNA nucleotide called uracil substitute every thymine
The RNA go process called turn
During translation every three RNA nucleotide code single amino acid
This set three nucleotide called different codon may code amino acid
In end sequence DNA turned sequence amino acid joined together long chain called protein
Proteins responsible function cell
Many thing happen process prevent gene turning protein protein created
In gene single DNA nucleotide mutated example adenine A guanine G may cause wrong amino acid made
If wrong amino acid made assembled long chain amino acid resulting protein may work
This different amino acid different many way size electric charge
These different characteristic affect interact well molecule surround amino acid water
For example positively negatively charged molecule prefer interact water called whereas nonpolar molecule like interact charged molecule water called
These seemingly small difference large consequence
For example cystic fibrosis mutation gene called gene encodes channel control flow particle cell
Specifically channel normally regulates whether small negatively charged particle called chloride ion flow flow cell
The movement charged particle act balance flow water cell
In people cystic fibrosis mutated gene creates channel function consequently flow water tissue abnormal
In turn abnormal flow water cause build thick mucus lining many internal organ many devastating effect different part body see Figure
Cystic fibrosis caused mutation gene encodes chloride channel important regulating water flow cell
Because many bodily function rely normal water flow disruption water flow cause number devastating effect shown Manifestations Cystic Fibrosis image Wikimedia Commons While DNA mutation clearly cause number genetic disease DNA mutation may problematic
In science project investigate cystic fibrosis genetic mutation cause using online genetic database
This investigation allow determine type mutation may alter function protein one may little effect
To science project need use database These resource good place start gathering information genetics genetic disease gene testing Information allele Table taken source Holographic Poster Letters Vinyl Letters Numbers ArtSkills Trifold Header Poster Making Kit ArtSkills Trifold Header Poster Lights This science project focus genetic disease cystic fibrosis genetic disease would like choose
See Variations section Table information science project genetic disease cystic fibrosis
Once tutorial information cystic fibrosis figure simple mutation DNA ended changing amino acid made well function entire protein
Table partly filled information allele gene
alternative form gene occur mutation DNA
allele allele shown cause cystic fibrosis
They mutation affect person get disease
This opposite pathogenic allele allele known harmful actually cause disease
In part science project filling rest Table additional information allele
You also select ten pathogenic allele fill information remaining empty row Table
This table contains information five allele known pathogenic
Some allele taken published scientific study see Bibliography citation assigned rsIDs labeled
For first allele relevant information entered example
For next four allele fill information empty cell
Pick ten pathogenic allele enter information table well
A DNA sequence converted mRNA every three mRNA nucleotide called codon code certain amino acid
This figure show mRNA codon code amino acid
A protein made sequence several specific amino acid
Consequently gene mutated DNA ultimately change function protein result image courtesy
You know amino acid mutated genetic disease interested became way mutation damaging normal structure protein
These genetic disease condition large amount data available genetic cause

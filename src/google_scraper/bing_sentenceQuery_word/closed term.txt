In also technique implementing language
closure storing together environment mapping associating function variable used locally defined enclosing scope name bound closure created
A plain function access closure copy value reference even function invoked outside scope
The following program fragment defines
The nested function access lexical scope even though local
The function return closure containing copy value copy reference function add value value Note return function variable
Invoking return invoking return
While refer function associated environment differ invoking closure bind name two distinct variable different value two invocation thus evaluating function different result
The concept closure developed mechanical evaluation expression first fully implemented language feature programming language support lexically scoped
defined term used evaluating expression
credit Landin introducing term refer whose open binding free variable closed bound lexical environment resulting closure
This usage subsequently adopted defined lexically scoped variant became widespread
The term often mistakenly used mean
This probably many programmer learn concept time form small helper function anonymous closure
An anonymous function function without name closure instance function whose variable bound either value depending language see section
For example following code rather variable closure case produced returning nested function free variable enclosing function free variable bind parameter enclosing function
However first case nested function name second case nested function anonymous
The closure need assigned variable used directly last original name used defining irrelevant
This usage may deemed anonymous closure
Note especially nested function definition closure free variable yet bound
Only enclosing function evaluated value parameter free variable nested function bound creating closure returned enclosing function
Lastly closure distinct function free variable outside scope variable otherwise defining environment execution environment coincide nothing distinguish static dynamic binding ca distinguished name resolve value
For example program function free variable bound variable global scope executed environment defined immaterial whether actually closure This often achieved function return since function must defined scope variable case typically scope smaller
This also achieved reduces scope variable though le common practice le useful shadowing discouraged
In example seen closure body bound global namespace local The use closure associated language function function returned result passed argument function call function free variable returning one creates closure
This includes well many modern imperative language Python
Closures also frequently used particularly used interaction
Traditional imperative language either support nested function C support calling nested function enclosing function exited GNU C Pascal thus avoiding need use closure
Closures used implement manner
Constructs thus implemented closure
In language closure may occur function defined within another function inner function refers local variable outer function
At outer function executes closure formed consisting inner function code reference upvalues variable outer function required closure
Closures typically appear language function word language enable function passed argument returned function call bound variable name like simpler type string integer
For example consider following function In example appears within function
When lambda expression evaluated Scheme creates closure consisting code lambda expression reference variable inside lambda expression
The closure passed function call repeatedly determine book added result list discarded
Because closure reference use variable time call
The function might defined completely separate file
Here example rewritten another popular language support closure The keyword used instead method instead global function otherwise structure effect code
A function may create closure return following example Because closure case outlives execution function creates variable live function return even though execution left scope longer visible
In language without closure lifetime automatic local variable coincides execution stack frame variable declared
In language closure variable must continue exist long existing closure reference
This commonly implemented using form
A closure used associate function set private variable persist several invocation function
The variable encompasses function accessed program code
In stateful language closure thus used implement paradigm state representation since closure upvalues variable indefinite value established one invocation remains available next
Closures used way longer thus longer nevertheless commonly used impure functional language
Closures many us Note Some speaker call data structure bind environment closure term usually refers specifically function
Closures typically implemented special contains plus representation function lexical environment set available variable time closure created
The referencing environment name corresponding variable lexical environment time closure created additionally extending lifetime least long lifetime closure
When closure later time possibly different lexical environment function executed variable referring one captured closure current environment
A language implementation easily support full closure memory model allocates linear
In language function automatic local variable deallocated function return
However closure requires free variable reference survive enclosing function execution
Therefore variable must allocated persist longer needed typically via rather stack lifetime must managed survive closure referencing longer use
This explains typically language natively support closure also use
The alternative manual memory management variable explicitly allocating heap freeing done using stack allocation language accept certain use case lead due freed automatic variable lambda expression nested function GNU The functional argument problem describes difficulty implementing function first class object programming language C
Similarly version assumed programmer know automatic local variable reference invalid return definition scope automatic local variable stack still permit many useful functional pattern complex case need explicit variable
D version solved detecting variable must stored heap performs automatic allocation
Because D us garbage collection version need track usage variable passed
In strict functional language immutable data easy implement automatic memory management garbage collection possible cycle variable reference
For example Erlang argument variable allocated heap reference additionally stored stack
After function return reference still valid
Heap cleaning done incremental garbage collector
In ML local variable lexically scoped hence define model since bound value object implementation free copy value closure data structure way invisible programmer
lexical scope system dynamic variable garbage collection lack stack programming model suffer limitation language
Closures expressed naturally Scheme
The lambda form encloses code free variable environment persist within program long possibly accessed used freely Scheme expression
Closures closely related Actors concurrent computation value function lexical environment called
An important issue closure language whether variable closure updated update synchronized
Actors provide one solution
Closures closely related transformation former latter known see also
As different language always common definition lexical environment definition closure may vary also
The commonly held minimalist definition lexical environment defines set scope also closure language capture
However meaning binding also differs
In imperative language variable bind relative location memory store value
Although relative location binding change runtime value bound location
In language since closure capture binding operation variable whether done closure performed relative memory location
This often called capturing variable reference
Here example illustrating concept one language Note function closure referred variable use relative memory location signified local variable
On hand many functional language bind variable directly value
In case since way change value variable bound need share state use value
This often called capturing variable value
Java local anonymous class also fall require captured local variable also mean need share state
Some language enable choose capturing value variable location
For example captured variable either declared mean captured reference mean captured value
Yet another subset functional language bind variable result future computation rather value
Consider example Haskell The binding captured closure defined within function computation case result division zero
However since computation captured value error manifest closure invoked actually attempt use captured binding
Yet difference manifest behavior lexically scoped construct statement
Such construct general considered term invoking established enclosing control statement case interpretation requires looping construct considered term recursive function call
In language ECMAScript refers continuation established closure lexically innermost respect within closure transfer control code called
However superficially similar operator invokes escape continuation established method invocation ignoring escape continuation intervening nested closure
The escape continuation particular closure invoked Smalltalk implicitly reaching end closure code
The following example ECMAScript Smalltalk highlight difference The code snippet behave differently Smalltalk operator JavaScript operator analogous
In ECMAScript example leave inner closure begin new iteration loop whereas Smalltalk example abort loop return method
provides construct express either action Lisp behaves Lisp behaves
Hence Smalltalk make possible captured escape continuation outlive extent successfully invoked
Consider When closure returned method invoked attempt return value invocation created closure
Since call already returned Smalltalk method invocation model follow discipline facilitate multiple return operation result error
Some language enable programmer choose way captured
An example Ruby Both example way create closure semantics closure thus created different respect statement
In definition scope control statement explicit arbitrarily named sake example
The following direct translation Ruby sample
Features language simulate feature closure
Language feature include technique example Java C Some library support
This sometimes implemented providing two value registering callback library function pointer separate pointer arbitrary data user choice
When library executes callback function pass along data pointer
This enables callback maintain state refer information captured time registered library
The idiom similar closure functionality syntax
The pointer type safe C idiom differs closure C Haskell ML
With gcc extension used function pointer emulate closure providing containing function exit
The example invalid enables defined inside
These called
When class named known anonymous class
A local class either named anonymous may refer name lexically enclosing class variable marked lexically enclosing method
The capturing variable enables capture variable value
Even variable want capture always copy temporary variable class
Capturing variable reference emulated using reference mutable container example array
The local class able change value container reference able change content container
With advent Java lambda expression closure cause code executed Local class one type inner class declared within body method
Java also support inner class declared enclosing class
They normally referred inner class
These defined body enclosing class full access instance variable enclosing class
Due binding instance variable inner class may instantiated explicit binding instance enclosing class using special syntax
Upon execution print integer
Beware confuse type class nested class declared way accompanied usage static modifier desired effect instead class special binding defined enclosing class
As Java support function first class object
Lambda expression form considered type T domain U image type
The expression called method standard method call
introduced form closure nonstandard extension
Apple made implementation available GCC clang compiler
Pointers block block literal marked
Normal local variable captured value block created inside block
Variables captured reference marked
Blocks need persist outside scope created may need copied
anonymous method lambda expression support closure In closure implemented delegate function pointer paired context pointer
class instance stack frame heap case closure
D version limited closure support
For example code work correctly variable stack returning test longer valid use probably calling foo via dg return integer
This solved explicitly allocating variable heap using structs class store needed closed variable construct delegate method implementing code
Closures passed function long used referenced value still valid example calling another function closure callback parameter useful writing generic data processing code limitation practice often issue
This limitation fixed D version variable automatically allocated heap used inner function delegate function escape current scope via assignment dg return
Any local variable argument referenced delegate referenced delegate escape current scope remain stack simpler faster heap allocation
The true inner class method reference function variable
enables defining overloading
These object behave somewhat like function functional programming language
They may created runtime may contain state implicitly capture local variable closure
As language also support closure type function object constructed automatically special language construct called
A closure may capture context either storing copy accessed variable member closure object reference
In latter case closure object escape scope referenced object invoking cause undefined behavior since closure extend lifetime context
includes defining closure
An inline agent object representing routine defined giving code routine
For example argument agent representing procedure two argument procedure find country corresponding coordinate display
The whole agent subscribed event type certain button whenever instance event type occurs button user clicked button procedure executed mouse coordinate passed argument
The main limitation Eiffel agent distinguishes closure language reference local variable enclosing scope
This design decision help avoiding ambiguity talking local variable value closure latest value variable value captured agent created
Only reference current object analogous Java feature argument agent accessed within agent body
The value outer local variable passed providing additional closed operand agent

In
In environment least one name number
The closure environment keep bound variable memory us closure
Peter Landin gave idea name
The made closure popular
Many programming language made time closure
function name sometimes wrongly called closure
Most language anonymous function also closure
An anonymous function also closure environment least one bound variable
An anonymous function environment closure
A named closure anonymous
may number type letter made simpler part
In rule programming language value given function returned function bound variable name
Functions take return function called
Most language function value also function closure
For example take look following Scheme function In example part function
When function run Scheme must make value lambda
It making closure code lambda reference variable inside lambda
A name bound value
The function run closure book list pick book return
Because closure reference closure use value time run closure
The function might written completely separate file
Here example rewritten JavaScript another popular language support closure ECMAScript us word instead method place function otherwise code thing way
A function may create closure return
The following example function return function
In Scheme In ECMAScript The closure environment keep bound variable function return
In language without closure value would lost enclosing function return
In language closure bound variable must kept memory long closure
A closure need formed using
The programming language example limited support anonymous function closure
For example one way ECMAScript example could implemented Python In example function named make closure together variable
The outer enclosing function named return closure
In case anonymous function would work also
Python must often use named function instead lambda expression may contain code return value code effect value
But language Scheme code return value Scheme everything expression
Closures many us In Scheme Note Some speaker call data structure bind environment closure term usually refers specifically function

A system commonly defined group interacting unit element common purpose
The unit element system cog wire people computer
Systems generally classified open system closed system take form mechanical biological social system
Open system refer system interact system outside environment whereas closed system refer system relatively little interaction system outside environment
For example living organism considered open system take substance environment food air return substance environment
Humans example inhale oxygen environment exhale carbon dioxide environment
Similarly organization consume raw material production product emit finished good pollution result
In contrast watch example closed system relatively unit little interaction exchange environment
All system boundary fact immediately apparent mechanical system watch much le apparent social system organization
The boundary open system interact system environment flexible closed system rigid largely impenetrable
A closed system perspective view organization relatively independent environmental influence
The closed system approach conceives organization system management technology personnel equipment material tends exclude competitor supplier distributor governmental regulator
This approach allows manager organizational theorist analyze problem examining internal structure business little consideration external environment
The perspective basically view organization much thermostat limited environmental input outside change temperature required effective operation
Once set thermostat require little maintenance ongoing function
While perspective dominant organization scholarship research subsequently emphasized role environment
Up manager ignored outside environment organization market government regulation like strategy process gave relatively little consideration impact external force might internal operation organization
Open system theory originated natural science subsequently spread field diverse computer science ecology engineering management psychotherapy
In contrast closed system open system perspective view organization entity take input environment transforms release output tandem reciprocal effect organization along environment organization operates
That organization becomes part parcel environment situated initiate feedback mechanism result achieved output organization environment
As approach spread among organizational theorist manager began incorporating view practice
Two early pioneer effort Daniel Katz Robert Kahn began viewing organization open social system specialized interdependent subsystem process communication feedback management linking subsystem
Katz Kahn argued closed system approach fails take account organization reciprocally dependent external environment
For example environmental force customer competitor exert considerable influence corporation highlighting essential relationship organization environment well importance maintaining external input achieve stable organization
Furthermore open system approach serf model business activity business process transforming input output realizing input taken external environment output placed environment
Companies use input labor fund equipment material produce good provide service design subsystem attain goal
These subsystem thus analogous cell body organization analogous body external market regulatory condition analogous environmental factor quality housing drinking water air availability nourishment
The production subsystem example focus converting input marketable output often constitutes primary purpose company
The boundary subsystem goal obtain input resource employee material equipment forth environment outside company necessary production subsystem
This subsystem also responsible providing organization information environment
This adaptive subsystem collect process information company operation goal aiding company adaptation external condition environment
Another subsystem management supervises coordinate subsystem ensure subsystem function efficiently
The management subsystem must resolve conflict solve problem allocate resource
To simplify process evaluating environmental influence organizational theorist use term task environment refer aspect environment immediately relevant management decision related goal setting goal realization
The task environment includes customer supplier competitor employee regulatory body
Furthermore contrast perspective assume environment static
Instead change rule rather exception
Consequently investigation environmental stability propensity change key task company making activity organization contingent various environmental force
As open system organization maintains stability feedback refers information output system obtains input task environment
The feedback positive negative lead change way organization transforms input output
Collier point feedback data enable open system organization determine impact input environment subsequent action either maintaining positive impact correcting negative impact
The difference closed system open system lie complexity environmental interaction
Closed system exhibit minimal interaction environment tightly guarded relatively impenetrable boundary
Consequently little information exchange take place organization environment closed system situation denies management opportunity receive feedback environment
Moreover closed system generally static provide room multiple alternative accomplishing result
Conversely open system human body modern organization intricately dependent environment
Organizations observe open system management design operational strategy along principle continuous information exchange continuous target market evaluation multiplicity alternative achieving goal
The point closed system open system represent continuum along organization open le open environment
The key defining variable governing degree openness complexity environment organization situated
Managers must take consideration organization position along continuum
The Linux computer operating system instance Red Hat corporation selling bundled revision multiple input geographically dispersed user represents organization would cease exist open system perspective
Thus stable environment low complexity consistent relatively closed system mechanistic management style environment consistent flexible decentralized organic management style

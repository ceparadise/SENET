What mean
I want make sure I definition correct I sound like idiot conversing
In IDE correct I wrong machine code
You program basically stepping program looking error
But exactly program
In VS I aware build program produce executable file debug folder
Any tech definition mean program
This necessarily bear human mean far MSBuild concerned code describes thusly suggests mean roughly compile plus associated auxiliary event get code artifact deployable result
Building mean many thing many people
The build contain many thing The build done hand automated hybrid two
A manual build build requires build command like compiler executed one one
An automated build package together individual build tool large build program ideally run single step
It mean process converting source artifact artifact
Many project involve lot source file
In principle manually compile one file use compiler compile source file temporary object file containing machine code
In practice far tedious manually compile every source file one time even tedious manually keep track source file need recompiled
So build entire project running automated build program typically called make
That program go list source file often stored yet another source file named makefile call compiler one many version make smart enough recompile file changed need recompiled
While compiling arguably important part build process often build run lot program compiler
Occasionally complete build spend time running program running compiler
For example many people find convenient single button compile source code latest version also run standard series test
So makefile also list whatever command needed run test become part build process
By posting answer agree

Many people study Computer Science included trouble explaining exactly people field
This article attempt defining field study four word le
Apologies advance article sound overly fluffy bullshitty I often get pontificate lofty abstract idea
Adults real job probably think since I working towards Computer Science I must spend day sipping latte engaging philosophical discussion colleague Ivory Tower reality I spend time trench hacking research prototype debugging memory error C code
So come rare attempt enjoy
It nearly impossible summarize entire field one word I choose one Computer Science would
At core Computer Science building clean abstract model abstraction messy noisy object phenomenon
As Computer Scientists must choose include model discard determine minimum amount necessary model order required degree accuracy
Computer Science mean solving problem start abstraction
For example first step building automated movie recommendation system like choose feature movie watcher behavior model movie watcher set relevant metric number time rented Arnold Schwarzenegger film
Ideally would like fully model human brain make recommendation obviously intractable least
The word I would immediately add summary
Related field like mathematics natural science also involve building abstraction geometric shape atomic structure model serve describe explain evoke action
What make Computer Science different deal putting model action solve problem
This involves creating instruction performing action data modeled
In movie recommendation example formed proper abstraction model need figure act order make recommendation
One simple algorithm would simply recommend Arnold movie people rented Arnold movie past perhaps throw Stallone movie mix
I purposely chosen first word since automation existed far invention Computer Science
People thought automation thousand year starting building tool automate aspect farming culminating assembly line Industrial Revolution
Instructions assembling cotton gin gun automobile definitely automating task deal world concrete object abstraction needed
In contrast abstraction solving problem like effectively finding information online predicting stock price optimizing flight plan save gasoline automatically detecting credit card fraud part reason Computer Science problem rather say industrial process engineering problem
Notice I mentioned computer far core Computer Science involve computer
You could imagine creating requisite model algorithm handing team people execute assembly line filled pencil paper
That would still Computer Science per se would slow solve practical problem
Computers electronic device engineered amazingly fast executing algorithm data solve real Computer Science problem need model algorithm abstraction form code instruction computer understand
This rubber hit road
So far dealing intangible fairy world abstract model algorithm
We might jot note paper formalize mathematical proof property write scholarly paper trying persuade others chosen model algorithm ought work well
However best proof proposed solution truly work come actually form computer program executing computer using output
No matter whether output shown person Google search result fed mechanical device airplane autopilot system direct tangible effect world
If implementation actually work nobody argue work statement sound silly really ca achieve high degree certainty undeniably correct life endeavour
The beauty correct implementation
As user way Netflix convince recommendation system work actually provides good recommendation without working implementation amount persuasive rhetoric CEO even mathematical proof resident theorist might contain logical flaw unrealistic assumption convince otherwise
The final word I piling onto summary
First foremost must ensure implementation matter fast code run properly solve problem
Next think designing data model algorithm run quickly taking minimal amount resource memory hard disk space electricity
Computer Science researcher developed many theoretical empirical technique make implementation algorithm efficient
So efficient enough
Well depends particular application
If movie recommendation algorithm must run year giving result user useless
Actually ran today Netflix Google algorithm computer built year ago would probably actually take year run
But difference taking second run second factor might matter user
Again word I would use describing essence Computer Science order significance Note I purposely use either word summary since I think properly embody essence field
I finish thought two word though merely tool Computer Science idea
Edsger Dijkstra pioneer field said That said though since computer link Computer Science real world lot Computer Science research actually geared towards improving capability computer
Researchers engineer write computer program help build powerful computer faster processor storage creates wonderful positive feedback loop next generation powerful computer able implement even ambitious Computer Science idea including idea improve future generation computer
Also lot Computer Science research geared towards helping people interact productively computer computer exist would research like programming language operating system interaction
And I believe one must constantly use scientific method hypothesis creation testing refinement designing implementing debugging tweaking implementation Computer Science idea
Nobody design implement idea correctly first attempt methodical scientific mindset required create correct efficient implementation Computer Science idea
Many idea article inspired final lecture given Professor John Guttag entitled
Assistant Professor UC San Diego RSS

Several industry use automated system increase production reduce cost
A common example ATM process banking transaction without teller
Automated system incorporated production line machine year
The main purpose automated system help speed process
Tasks inconvenient often incorporated system
Some manufacturing company work develop automated system handle job would difficult human
Automated system used handle wide range task
Systems key component allow function properly including control system way interpret distribute data human interface
Programmable logic allows system process data control
In computer industry many task require constant human attention
Software used complete number different task automatically post result
Bots programmed click object screen send message preset time interact social network using artificial intelligence

What tool use Automated Builds Automated Deployments
Why
What tool recommend
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
automated build
I chose easiest setup demo
A system complex wo impress management enough get automated build
Especially project lot inertia
NAnt build MSBuild Rake almost anything would fine deployment
I currently working new Cruise ThoughtWorks studio provides better way stage various pipeline let deploy version I want target environment
We use JetBrains
They also make Resharper And IntelliJ
We use building application quite easy set connect TFS run additional tool
It polished actually kinda reminds site
Found much nicer CruiseControl team size free
If need lot different build build cost bit still quite reasonable
Funnily enough I spent two week overhauling read implementing scratch nightly build process
Great fun really
I toyed idea installing Team Foundation Server use Perforce source control I think worth hassle
Our process set Powershell script run dedicated server following scheduled task Wipe entire source tree check anything checked first
Bring entire source tree Perforce last labelled build Generate change report syncing HEAD watching come Build App Index PDB file Perforce source Store binary symbol dedicated symbol server Run test project Build installer Label Send email group status report Works well
linux window
Instead letting me script xml file come predefined graphical macro operation allows create task easily
For stuff use
We use combination build tool continuous integration server Build tool Continuous Integration Servers automated build
Works great
For automated build I think best tool going right JetBrain Team City
The free version feature need person team
Set easy configuring new project painless relatively importantly reliable
For automated migration nothing beat PowerShell
UppercuT us NAnt build insanely easy use Build Framework
Automated Builds easy solution name source control path company name project
Some good explanation UppercuT conventional automated build mean set config file get bunch feature free
Arguably powerful feature ability specify environment setting ONE place applied everywhere including documentation build source
Documentation available Features At work use good ol build Java servlets
We used use Visual Build Kinook software recently new application switched MSBuild since better integration TFS ability create custom task
The GNU Autotools definitely
The standard unix system
I success using triggered script subversion repository
This used automated build automated testing
build
Makes great installer
We use automated build
We branch code java C cross platform compiles installers OS
Make build
Debian package deployment since production server run
running NAnt script PowerShell deployment
I found using NAnt powered TeamCity instead native TeamCity runner allows u much richer build process eg
cs minimiser etc
It also mean full process run developer PC instead TeamCity server making much easier customise debug problem build process

defined technology process procedure performed without human assistance
In word use various operating equipment machinery process factory boiler heat treating oven switching telephone network steering stabilization ship aircraft application vehicle minimal reduced human intervention process completely automated
Automation achieved various mean including mechanical electrical electronic device usually combination
Complicated system modern factory typically use combined technique
The benefit automation include labor saving saving saving material cost improvement quality accuracy precision
The term inspired earlier word coming widely used Ford established automation department
It time industry rapidly adopting introduced
Fundamentally two type control loop open loop control closed loop feedback control
In open loop control control action controller independent process output controlled process variable
A good example central heating boiler controlled timer heat applied constant time regardless temperature building
The control action switching boiler
The process output building temperature
In closed loop control control action controller dependent process output
In case boiler analogy would include thermostat monitor building temperature thereby feed back signal ensure controller maintains building temperature set thermostat
A closed loop controller therefore feedback loop ensures controller exerts control action give process output Reference input set point
For reason closed loop controller also called feedback controller
The definition closed loop control system according British Standard Institution control system possessing monitoring feedback deviation signal formed result feedback used control action final control element way tend reduce deviation zero
Likewise system tends maintain prescribed relationship one system variable another comparing function variable using difference mean control
The advanced type automation revolutionized manufacturing aircraft communication industry feedback control usually involves taking measurement using making calculated adjustment keep measured variable within set range
The theoretical basis closed loop automation
The control action form controller output action
One simplest type control control
An example thermostat used household appliance either open close electrical contact
Thermostats originally developed true mechanism rather common household appliance thermostat
Sequence control programmed sequence operation performed often based system logic involves system state
An elevator control system example sequence control
A widely used
A PID controller continuously calculates difference desired measured applies correction based term respectively sometimes denoted give name controller type
The theoretical understanding application date implemented nearly analogue control system originally mechanical controller using discrete electronics latterly industrial process computer
Sequential control may either fixed sequence logical one perform different action depending various system state
An example adjustable otherwise fixed sequence timer lawn sprinkler
States refer various condition occur use sequence scenario system
An example elevator us logic based system state perform certain action response state operator input
For example operator press floor n button system respond depending whether elevator stopped moving going door open closed condition
An early development sequential control electrical relay engage electrical contact either start interrupt power device
Relays first used telegraph network developed controlling device starting stopping electric motor opening closing solenoid valve
Using relay control purpose allowed control action could triggered sequence response external event
These flexible response rigid cam timer
More complicated example involved maintaining safe sequence device swing bridge control lock bolt needed disengaged bridge could moved lock bolt could released safety gate already closed
The total number relay cam timer drum sequencer number hundred even thousand factory
Early technique language needed make system manageable one first diagram interconnected relay resembled rung ladder
Special computer called later designed replace collection hardware single easily unit
In typical hard wired motor start stop circuit called motor started pushing Start Run button activates pair electrical relay
The relay lock contact keep control circuit energized push button released
The start button normally open contact stop button normally closed contact
Another relay energizes switch power device throw motor starter switch three set contact three phase industrial power main power circuit
Large motor use high voltage experience high current making speed important making breaking contact
This dangerous personnel property manual switch
The lock contact start circuit main power contact motor held engaged respective electromagnet stop button pressed lock relay
Commonly added control circuit
Suppose motor example powering machinery critical need lubrication
In case interlock could added insure oil pump running motor start
Timers limit switch electric eye common element control circuit
widely used compressed air hydraulic fluid powering mechanical component
While motor used supply continuous rotary motion actuator typically better choice intermittently creating limited range movement mechanical component moving various mechanical arm opening closing valve raising heavy press roll applying pressure press
Computers perform sequential control feedback control typically single computer industrial application
PLCs type special purpose microprocessor replaced many hardware component timer drum sequencer used type system
General purpose process control computer increasingly replaced stand alone controller single computer able perform operation hundred controller
Process control computer process data network PLCs instrument controller order implement typical control many individual variable case implement complex control using multiple input mathematical manipulation
They also analyze data create real time graphical display operator run report operator engineer management
Control ATM example interactive process computer perform logic derived response user selection based information retrieved networked database
The ATM process similarity online transaction process
The different logical response called
Such process typically designed aid guide writing software code
The earliest feedback control mechanism water clock invented Greek engineer Ctesibius BC
In modern era invented Dutch scientist
Note Early thermostat temperature regulator controller rather mechanism common household appliance
Another control mechanism used tent sail windmill
It patented Edmund Lee
Also invented first automated loom
In invented first fully automated spinning mill driven water power known time
An automatic flour mill developed making first completely automated industrial process
The invented seventeenth century used adjust gap
Another centrifugal governor used Bunce England part model
The centrifugal governor adopted James Watt use steam engine Watt partner Boulton saw one flour mill building
The governor could actually hold set speed engine would assume new constant speed response load change
The governor able handle smaller variation caused fluctuating heat load boiler
Also tendency oscillation whenever speed change
As consequence engine equipped governor suitable operation requiring constant speed cotton spinning
Several improvement governor plus improvement valve timing steam engine made engine suitable industrial us end century
Advances steam engine stayed well ahead science thermodynamics
The governor received relatively little scientific attention published paper established beginning theoretical basis understanding control theory
Development electronic amplifier important long distance telephony required higher signal noise ratio solved negative feedback noise cancellation
This telephony application contributed control theory
In German mathematician developed theory discontinuous automatic control found military application aircraft
introduced factory underwent rapid adaption though
Central electric power station also undergoing rapid growth operation new high pressure boiler steam turbine electrical substation created large demand instrument control
Central control room became common late early process control
Operators typically monitored chart drawn recorder plotted data instrument
To make correction operator manually opened closed valve turned switch
Control room also used color coded light send signal worker plant manually make certain change
Controllers able make calculated change response deviation set point rather control began introduced
Controllers allowed manufacturing continue showing productivity gain offset declining influence factory electrification
Factory productivity greatly increased electrification
Manufacturing productivity growth fell
Field note spending instrument increased significantly remained strong thereafter
In Texaco Port Arthur refinery became first chemical plant use
Conversion factory digital control began spread rapidly price computer hardware fell
The automatic telephone switchboard introduced along dial telephone
By Bell system automatic
Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifier switch consumed large amount electricity
Call volume eventually grew fast feared telephone system would consume electricity production prompting begin research
The logic performed telephone switching relay inspiration digital computer
The first commercially successful glass bottle blowing machine automatic model introduced
The machine operated crew working shift could produce bottle hour compared bottle made crew six men boy working shop day
The cost making bottle machine cent per gross compared per gross manual glassblower helper
Sectional electric drive developed using control theory
Sectional electric drive used different section machine precise differential must maintained section
In steel rolling metal elongates pass pair roller must run successively faster speed
In paper making paper sheet shrink pass around steam heated drying arranged group must run successively slower speed
The first application sectional electric drive paper machine
One important development steel industry century continuous wide strip rolling developed Armco
Before automation many chemical made batch
In widespread use instrument emerging use controller founder Dow Chemical advocating
machine tool displaced hand dexterity could operated boy unskilled laborer developed
automated NC using punched paper tape
This soon evolved computerized numerical control CNC
Today extensive automation practiced practically every type manufacturing assembly process
Some larger process include electrical power generation oil refining chemical steel mill plastic cement plant fertilizer plant pulp paper mill automobile truck assembly aircraft production glass manufacturing natural gas separation plant food beverage processing canning bottling manufacture various kind part
Robots especially useful hazardous application like automobile spray painting
Robots also used assemble electronic circuit board
Automotive welding done robot automatic welder used application like pipeline
The main advantage automation The following method often employed improve productivity quality robustness
The main disadvantage automation In manufacturing purpose automation shifted issue broader productivity cost time
Increased automation often cause worker feel anxious losing job technology render service unnecessary
Anxiety automation ubiquitous since
instance English textile worker destroyed weaving machine century believed efficient machine would replace job entirely leaving work
According Pew Research Center currently Americans worried increasing automation workplace contrast Swedes see automation artificial intelligence good thing due country welfare state support worker
Lights manufacturing production system near automated hiring worker
In order eliminate need labor cost altogether
The cost automation environment different depending technology product engine automated
There automated engine consume energy resource Earth comparison previous engine vice versa
Hazardous operation manufacturing form always early contender automation
Another major shift automation increased demand flexibility convertibility manufacturing process
Manufacturers increasingly demanding ability easily switch manufacturing Product A manufacturing Product B without completely rebuild
Flexibility distributed process led introduction Natural Features Navigation
Digital electronics helped
Former instrumentation replaced digital equivalent accurate flexible offer greater scope sophisticated configuration parametrization operation
This accompanied revolution provided networked
single cable mean communicating control system field level instrumentation eliminating
plant adopted technology fast
The conservative process industry longer plant life cycle slower adopt measurement control still dominates
The growing use factory floor pushing trend still enabling manufacturing plant integrated tightly within enterprise via internet necessary

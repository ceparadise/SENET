This chapter report key point analysis university
It sense exhaustive instance take time point variety nuanced way particular factor may simultaneously strength weakness threat opportunity
Yet instructive note short list four category
In instance implied comparison present potential competitor
Strengths cited institutional characteristic broader specific program office individual
Presumably would endure even strong program office eliminated outstanding individual left university
No ranking intended order list

In last year private Little Rock University institution received zero dollar state appropriation
In first year public University Arkansas Little Rock institution received million state dollar

UALR singular role among public university Arkansas serving transfer student entered UALR fall
Each year UALR admits transfer student percentage undergraduate enrollment Arkansas campus
The significance service state overstated given state compelling interest seeing higher percentage Arkansas population hold least bachelor degree
No university Arkansas except UALR consistently graduate student admitted four year earlier freshman baseline determining retention graduation rate
But UALR consistently
Chapter depicts difference UALR campus

As noted preceding section state funding strength put perspective size endowment would required provide funding equal annual state appropriation
However compared funding level state government provide public university level state support UALR weakness
With UALR funded percent average university across country similar set program difficult UALR pay competitive salary provide competitive number scholarship keep abreast technology adequately fund library maintain building etc
See discussion new state funding formula higher education Chapter

Recent high school graduate often eager step adulthood getting away home enrolling college
Recent high school graduate leaving home first time especially parent often desire convenience sense security go living university student housing campus
As commuter campus UALR throughout history compete best entering freshman institution abundant student housing long tradition student life campus
UALR second residence hall project construction raise student population housed campus
A related weakness limited supply private scholarship attract entering freshman retain subsequent year study
Most UALR student year receive financial aid federal state grant loan institutional academic scholarship totaling percent award award totaling privately funded scholarship

The average composite ACT score UALR entering freshman hovered around score reflects minimum admission threshold
Figure compare remediation profile UALR entering freshman cumulative profile institution Arkansas showing institution receives work large number student start distance behind starting line

Of entering freshman UALR fall six year later percent graduated
At institution substantial enrollment average course load credit hour per semester expected lower percentage student graduate six year compared traditional campus much higher percentage student
This one basis complaint standard measure retention graduation used state federal official fit urban institution serving many nontraditional student transfer student
However UALR compare well even peer group
Figure Chapter show UALR ranking metropolitan institution graduation rate

This weakness unique UALR
It weakness shared institution higher education one variety national accrediting association endeavoring address assessment standard faculty measure learning outcome enrolled student
Measuring impact instruction prescribed educational experience total learning student often difficult directly
Therefore indirect measure proxy required
Retention rate graduation rate example popular
These measure reflect well institution enroll greater percentage student high income high test score necessarily good indicator institution performance contributing student academic success
But fact remains legislator public official want evidence unreasonably institution higher education good job instructional program
In light substantial public funding asked provide demand legislator others likely go away
It public accountability issue

Although alumnus office development office done well resource available fact institutional investment limited
Accordingly activity success also measured frequency contact alumnus number participant alumnus activity number donor level donation annual giving program
Is something strength opportunity
Is weakness threat
Persons involved strategic least academic often debate two question reasonably come different conclusion
Location example clearly great advantage UALR might defined strength
But advantage university making viewed balance opportunity

UALR singular advantage among university Arkansas location capital city geographic center state
The Greater Little Rock metropolitan area center population government state government also major federal presence plus government largest county city sizable local government medicine health care finance business transportation intersection major interstate highway port Arkansas River national airport communication cultural organization
The metropolitan area also includes zoo large variety organization including Winrock International Heifer International presidential library
The reality UALR located great place building powerhouse university
The Greater Little Rock area offer opportunity galore number depth unmatched elsewhere state

During last decade Latino population grown rapidly central Arkansas state offer UALR significant opportunity
With record welcoming minority student UALR could become campus choice growing segment state population

Since substantial increase number college number student enrolled campus
Today public institution enrolled student compared university
These campus source additional transfer student UALR
There area partnership could mutually advantageous UALR one college
Pulaski Technical College nearby offer extensive opportunity mutually beneficial relationship
A partnership make possible UALR raise admission standard route freshman first Pulaski Technical College
In game life many people undistinguished ACT SAT score later excel reach top
By virtue location mission UALR historically played important role opening door university education people
Nonetheless clearer division labor UALR Pulaski Technical College would make sense

Figure show percentage person Arkansans earned bachelor higher degree percent compared national figure percent
Arkansas rank among state measure anything trend line show slowly widening gap national average Arkansas
For people Arkansas trend sign good thing come economy demanding competitive workforce leadership go
State Workforce Priorities
UALR opportunity indeed obligation offer expand program study respond state workforce priority determined state official
The best way determine state workforce priority follow state student assistance money
Table provides overview state scholarship student loan forgiveness program
The largest state scholarship program Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarship high school graduate aimed encouraging high school graduate enroll remain college
This program serf broad goal increasing state college attendance graduation rate
Students meeting academic family income requirement eligible regardless field study
Two companion program based academic Scholars Distinguished Governor aimed preventing brain drain keeping state best brightest high school graduate state
A recent Workforce Improvement aimed increasing college participation offering financial assistance nontraditional may enroll
There additional smaller state scholarship program student loan forgiveness program target present anticipated shortage teacher specified subject minority teacher nurse
UALR already offer program study identified teaching field nursing
The Arkansas Technical Careers Student Loan Forgiveness Program target student complete degree prepare graduate work high technology business field including advanced manufacturing technology
The following UALR program state roster approved program eligible Arkansas Technical Careers Student Loan Forgiveness Program system engineering molecular biotechnology information technology computer science computer programming computer information system computer engineering technology electronics engineering technology
It requires little imagination draw extensive list potential development might adversely affect organization survival point future
The focus hypothetical threat would classified present active

The expansion number campus Arkansas brought new student higher education enrollment state also increased
Most new institution located small town little adverse impact enrollment specific campus
A college however located community one existing institution cause enrollment decline latter institution often assumed offer course rigorous expensive
In Pulaski School became Pulaski Technical College
With guidance Arkansas Department Higher Education assistance UALR Pulaski Tech began offering freshman sophomore credit course secured accreditation North Central Association Colleges Schools
Pulaski Tech thus began rapid growth enrollment contributed corresponding decline enrollment UALR
In Pulaski Tech enrolled student
In enrolled student
See Figure show enrollment trend line
At lowest point enrollment downturn UALR lost approximately percent total undergraduate semester credit hour
UALR official anticipated beginning Pulaski Tech would negative impact UALR enrollment nonetheless supportive growth development Pulaski Tech believing presence sizable strong college good community state
The rub model funding university whether public private assumes pyramid large enrollment freshman sophomore course base pyramid making possible offer expensive course junior senior graduate level require faculty
UALR expect receive increasing number transfer student Pulaski Tech grows official two campus developing cooperative relationship end
This case threat also defined opportunity
The number student transferring Pulaski Tech UALR rose encouraging
See Figure
However many year ever number transfer student Pulaski Tech equal number qualified student lost Pulaski Tech freshman sophomore level
UALR challenge recruiting freshman compounded fact university state expanded institutional scholarship budget stepped advertising recruitment effort Little Rock area number university based state begun offer class Little Rock

Between population area city within approximate radius UALR declined percent
See Table show change
Loss population signal social distress
It often accompanied deterioration housing stock park street school retail business
Although would easy exaggerate decline university neighborhood decline reality
One say minimum neighborhood appears unhealthy unattractive make harder recruit retain student faculty staff
The university planning environment always complex always changing

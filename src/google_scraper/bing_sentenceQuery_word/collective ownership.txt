Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is absolute must following methodology practice instead example
Collective code ownership
It however part
Extreme programming Scrum work well together
The central element Scrum team
Therefore highly encouraged practice collective code ownership opposition sort
Scrum work best big project lot uncertainty big team devs code base
Weak code ownership effective smaller team smaller project Paul Graham
On topic code ownership I think put better I could ever possibly write I want depend anything without owner
I see reasoning infuriating
Shifting focus software wetware dirty trick loved technically impotent loser type
attempt distinguishing ilk I want depend stuff owner I require happy owner
Contrary common managerial assumption one rarely hold keep manager sane I believe forcibly assigning ownership
If owner like module expect pretty lousy gardening job
weak code ownership believer
I think collective code ownership absolutely necessary scrum however le code ownership flexibility task assignment
This especially true multiple scrum team
Less code ownership also remove bottleneck develop one code owner overworked
Code ownership give continuity development depending skill set team member may impossible remove completely

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
From understanding collective ownership solve common problem antiquated quality failure due absence
However thing I understand
Added point
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
Collective code ownership mean everyone team get say every line code written
The code still written individual unless pair programming making decision feel best time
The point individual owns section code
If John wrote Foo module reason critical bug discovered John away nothing stopping Sue jumping fixing
It John code team
So question Sue fix code John wrote
answer Sue rest team decided every line John rather John spirit teamwork cooperation knowing would person working code took time write test document code Sue would able work
Sue might also experience code code review chance team decide code written merely make sure serving purpose whatever standard team follows
As point experimentation exploration etc
belong prototype personal project production code
It happen course
I would expect issue arise wrong decision raised discussed retrospective
Hopefully team would recognise error made adjust
Why indeed
The team discus pro con different approach
They may decide technically solution appropriate
A healthy team discus openly make decision based collective experience
A good team looking way good job
They collaboration reinforcing strength individual team
If rogue behaviour causing issue get raised discussed retrospective
Peer pressure usually sufficient encourage rogue work productive way particularly ill effect demonstrated
It okay happens
The idea fast adapt update plan move trying something else
The fast concept another way apply Scientific Method work
Only addressing first question I mobile

shared group intelligence collective effort competition many individual appears
The term appears context mass application
It may involve formalism mean quantifying mass activity
Collective IQ measure collective intelligence although often used interchangeably term collective intelligence
Collective intelligence also attributed animal
It understood among expert new insight well recognized authority continually learns feedback produce knowledge better decision three element acting alone
Or narrowly emergent property people way processing information
This notion collective intelligence referred symbiotic intelligence Norman Lee Johnson
The concept used mass communication also appears
defines collective intelligence It form universally distributed intelligence constantly enhanced coordinated real time resulting effective mobilization skill
I add following indispensable characteristic definition The basis goal collective intelligence mutual recognition enrichment individual rather cult fetishized community
According researcher refers capacity networked Information communication technology enhance collective pool social knowledge simultaneously expanding extent human interaction
Collective intelligence strongly contributes shift knowledge power individual collective
According JC Herz intelligence eventually generate superior outcome knowledge generated proprietary software developed within corporation
Media theorist see collective intelligence source medium power related convergence culture
He draw attention education way people learning participate knowledge culture outside formal learning setting
criticizes school promote problem solver learner remaining hostile learning mean collective intelligence
Both support claim collective intelligence important interlinked culture sustained collective idea sharing thus contributes better understanding diverse society
Similar general individual intelligence new scientific understanding collective intelligence aim extract general collective intelligence factor group indicating group ability perform wide range task
Definition operationalization statistical method derived
Similarly highly interrelated concept measurement collective intelligence interpreted intelligence quotient group even though score quotient per se
Causes predictive validity investigated well
Writers influenced idea collective intelligence include Peter Russell
The concept although named originated whose jury theorem state member voting group likely make correct decision probability highest vote group correct decision increase number member group see
Many theorist interpreted statement feast many contribute better dinner provided single purse mean many may bring different dish table deliberation many may contribute different piece information generate better decision
Recent scholarship however suggests probably Aristotle meant modern interpretation based know team intelligence
A precursor concept found entomologist observation seemingly independent individual cooperate closely become indistinguishable single organism

Their approach rooted
The term group intelligence sometimes used interchangeably term collective intelligence
Anita Woolley present Collective intelligence measure group intelligence group creativity
The idea measure collective intelligence cover broad range feature group mainly group composition group interaction
The feature composition lead increased level collective intelligence group include criterion higher number woman group well increased diversity group
Atlee Pór suggest field collective intelligence primarily seen human enterprise willingness share openness value distributed intelligence common good paramount though group theory something offer
Individuals respect collective intelligence confident ability recognize whole indeed greater sum individual part
Maximizing collective intelligence relies ability organization accept develop The Golden Suggestion potentially useful input member

According collective intelligence
In order concept happen four principle need exist A new scientific understanding collective intelligence defines group general ability perform wide range task
Definition operationalization statistical method similar
Hereby individual performance given set cognitive task used measure general cognitive ability indicated general intelligence extracted via
In vein serf display performance difference cognitive task collective intelligence research aim find parallel intelligence factor group factor also called intelligence factor displaying difference task performance
The collective intelligence score used predict group perform similar task future
Yet task hereby refer mental intellectual task performed small group even though concept hoped transferrable performance group crowd reaching family company even whole city
Since individual factor score highly correlated score turn regarded good estimate measurement collective intelligence also seen intelligence indicator quotient respectively group parallel individual intelligence quotient IQ even though score quotient per se
Mathematically variable summarizing positive correlation among different task supposing performance one task comparable performance similar task
thus source variance among group considered group standing factor compared group given relevant population
The concept contrast competing hypothesis including correlational structure explain group intelligence composition several equally important independent factor found
Besides scientific idea also aim explore cause affecting collective intelligence group size collaboration tool group member interpersonal skill
The instance announced detection one main goal aiming develop
Individual intelligence shown genetically environmentally influenced
Analogously collective intelligence research aim explore reason certain group perform intelligent group given moderately correlated intelligence individual group member
According Woolley et al
result neither team cohesion motivation satisfaction correlated
However claim three factor found significant correlate variance number speaking turn group member average social sensitivity proportion female
All three similar predictive power social sensitivity statistically significant
The number speaking turn indicates group people dominated conversation le collectively intelligent equal distribution conversational
Hence providing multiple team member chance speak made group intelligent
Group member social sensitivity measured via Reading Mind Eyes Test RME correlated
Hereby participant asked detect thinking feeling expressed people eye presented picture assessed multiple choice format
The test aim measure people also called reading refers ability attribute mental state belief desire intent people far people understand others belief desire intention perspective different one
RME ToM test adult show sufficient reliability constantly differentiates control group individual functional
It one widely accepted test ToM within adult
ToM regarded associated subset skill ability within broader concept
The proportion female predictor vein previous research showing woman score higher social sensitivity test
While statistically speaking clarifies mechanism underlying relationship dependent independent variable Wolley agreed interview finding
However relativizes stating actual important thing high social sensitivity group member
It theorized collective intelligence factor emergent property resulting well process
Hereby process cover aggregated characteristic
process cover group structure norm influence group way collaborating coordinating
process cover group interaction structure process norm
An example process conversational
Research suggest collectively intelligent group communicate general well equally applies participation shown well online group communicating via writing
process include group composition namely characteristic group member aggregated team level encompassing
An example process average social sensitivity average maximum intelligence score group member
Furthermore collective intelligence found related group cognitive diversity including thinking style perspective
Groups moderately diverse higher collective intelligence similar cognitive style different
Consequently group member similar lack variety perspective skill needed perform well
On hand group whose member different seem difficulty communicate coordinate effectively
For human history collective intelligence confined small tribal group opinion aggregated parallel interaction among member
In modern time mass communication mass medium networking technology enabled collective intelligence span massive group distributed across continent
To accommodate shift scale collective intelligence group dominated serialized polling process aggregating like rating time
While modern system benefit larger group size serialized process found introduce substantial noise distorts collective output group
In one significant study serialized collective intelligence found first vote contributed serialized voting system distort final result
To address problem serialized aggregation input among group recent advancement collective intelligence worked replace serialized vote poll market parallel system modeled synchronous swarm nature
Based natural process artificial swarm networked human enable participant work together parallel answer question make prediction emergent collective intelligence
In one example human swarm challenge CBS Interactive predict Kentucky Derby
The swarm correctly predicted first four horse order defying odds turning bet
Woolley Chabris Pentland Hashmi Malone originator scientific understanding collective intelligence found single statistical factor collective intelligence research across group people randomly recruited public
In Woolley et al
two initial study group worked together different task taxonomy group task
Tasks chosen four quadrant circumplex included visual puzzle brainstorming making collective moral judgment negotiating limited resource
The result task taken conduct
Both study showed support general collective intelligence factor underlying difference group performance initial eigenvalue accounting study variance whereas next factor accounted
That fit range normally found research regarding typically accounting percent performance difference cognitive test
Afterwards complex criterion task absolved group measuring whether extracted factor predictive power performance outside original task battery
Criterion task playing standardized computer first complex architectural design task second study
In using individual intelligence group member predict performance criterion task significant effect average maximum individual intelligence
While average maximum intelligence individual group member moderately correlated still much better predictor criterion task
According Woolley et support existence collective intelligence factor demonstrates effect beyond group member individual intelligence thus aggregation individual IQs influence group member highest IQ
Engel et al
replicated Woolley et al
finding applying accelerated battery task first factor factor analysis explaining variance performance following factor explaining le half amount
Moreover found similar result group working together online communicating via text confirmed role female proportion social sensitivity causing collective intelligence case
Similarly Wolley et also measured social sensitivity RME actually meant measure people ability detect mental state people eye
The online collaborating participant however neither know see
The author conclude score RME must related broader set ability social reasoning drawing inference people eye expression
A collective intelligence factor sense Woolley et al
found group MBA student working together course semester online gaming group well group different culture group different context term versus group
None investigation considered team member individual intelligence score control variable
Note well field collective intelligence research quite young published empirical evidence relatively rare yet
However various proposal working paper progress already completed supposedly still publication process
Next predicting group performance complex criterion task shown original experiment collective intelligence factor also found predict group performance diverse task MBA class lasting several month
Thereby highly collectively intelligent group earned significantly higher score group assignment although member better individually performed assignment
Moreover highly collective intelligent team improved performance time suggesting collectively intelligent team learn better
This another potential parallel individual intelligence intelligent people found acquire new material quicker
Individual intelligence used predict plenty life outcome school attainment career success health outcome even mortality
Whether collective intelligence able predict outcome besides group performance mental task still investigated
Gladwell showed relationship individual IQ success work certain point additional IQ point estimate IQ translate real life advantage
If similar border exists advantage linear infinite still explored
Similarly demand research possible connection individual collective intelligence exists within plenty potentially transferable logic individual intelligence instance development time question improving intelligence
Whereas controversial whether human intelligence enhanced via training group collective intelligence potentially offer simpler opportunity improvement exchanging team member implementing structure technology
Moreover social sensitivity found least temporarily improvable reading well watching drama movie
In far training ultimately improves collective intelligence social sensitivity remains open question
There advanced concept factor model attempting explain individual cognitive ability including categorization intelligence
Further supplementing explanation conceptualization factor structure factor though missing yet
Other scholar explain team performance aggregating team member general intelligence team level instead building overall collective intelligence measure
Devine Philips showed mean cognitive ability predicts team performance laboratory setting well field setting note small effect
Suggesting strong dependence relevant task scholar showed task requiring high degree communication cooperation found influenced team member lowest cognitive ability
Tasks selecting best team member successful strategy shown influenced member highest cognitive ability
Since Woolley et al
result show influence group satisfaction motivation least implicitly challenge concept regarding importance group performance general thus contrast proven evidence concerning positive effect motivation satisfaction group performance
Noteworthy also involved researcher among confirming finding widely overlap author participating original first study around Anita Woolley
In Tadeusz Tad Szuba Poland proposed formal model phenomenon collective intelligence
It assumed unconscious random parallel distributed computational process run mathematical logic social structure
In model being information modeled abstract information molecule carrying expression mathematical logic
They displacing due interaction environment intended displacement
Their interaction abstract computational space creates inference process perceive collective intelligence
Thus model computation used
This theory allows simple formal definition collective intelligence property seems working well wide spectrum being bacterial colony human social structure
Collective intelligence considered specific computational process providing straightforward explanation several social phenomenon
For model collective intelligence formal definition IQS IQ Social proposed defined probability function time domain inference reflecting inference activity social structure
While IQS seems computationally hard modeling social structure term computational process described give chance approximation
Prospective application optimization company maximization IQS analysis drug resistance collective intelligence bacterial colony

Tom Atlee reflects although human innate ability gather analyze data affected culture education social institution
A single person tends make decision motivated
Therefore without collective intelligence human may drive extinction based selfish need
Phillip Brown Hugh Lauder quote Bowles order truly define collective intelligence crucial separate IQism
They go argue intelligence achievement developed allowed
For example earlier group lower level society severely restricted aggregating pooling intelligence
This elite fear collective intelligence would convince people rebel
If capacity relation would infrastructure collective intelligence built
This reflects powerful collective intelligence left develop
Skeptics especially critical artificial intelligence inclined believe risk bodily action basis unity people likely emphasize capacity group take action withstand harm one fluid shrugging harm way body shrug loss cell
This strain thought obvious characterized work typically shun academic

also known method testing test internal structure working application opposed functionality

In testing internal perspective system well programming skill used design test case
The tester chooses input exercise path code determine expected output
This analogous testing node circuit

testing applied level process
Although traditional tester tended think testing done unit level used integration system testing frequently today
It test path within unit path unit integration subsystem test
Though method test design uncover many error problem potential miss unimplemented part specification missing requirement
test design technique include following criterion testing method testing application level source code
These test case derived use design technique mentioned testing data flow testing branch testing path testing statement coverage decision coverage well modified coverage
testing use technique guideline create environment examining fragile code
These testing technique building block testing whose essence careful testing application source code level prevent hidden error later
These different technique exercise every visible path source code minimize error create environment
The whole point testing ability know line code executed able identify correct output
testing basic procedure require tester knowledge source code tested
The programmer must deep understanding application know kind test case create every visible path exercised testing
Once source code understood source code analyzed test case created
The following three basic step testing take order create test case testing one two biggest testing methodology used today
It several major advantage Although testing great advantage perfect contains disadvantage A modern view dichotomy testing testing blurred becoming le relevant
Whereas originally meant using source code meant using requirement test derived many document various level abstraction
The real point test usually designed abstract structure input space graph logical predicate question level abstraction derive abstract structure
That source code requirement input space description one dozen type design model
Therefore distinction le important term le relevant
In testing refers methodology full knowledge system attacked
The goal penetration test simulate malicious insider knowledge possibly basic credential target system

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
The name overall process developing start finish
When starting new software project important plan developed maintained
There different theory develop test software
The process known cycle even piece software finished might necessary go back beginning
For example might possible update software based new piece technology become available
You might able make big change software work continue development cycle

Testing show presence absence bug
Edsger Dijkstra Two common type testing testing
Both drive driven development
testing also known functional testing treat software test without knowing internals
Tests using software interface trying ensure work expected
As long functionality interface remains unchanged test pas even internals changed
Tester aware program knowledge
testing commonly used type testing traditional organization tester separate department especially proficient coding difficulty understand code
It provides software test
Some Some If test driving development often done form acceptance criterion later used definition developed
In case testing relies form automation like
testing also known clear box testing glass box testing transparent box testing structural testing look inside software tested us knowledge part testing process
If example exception thrown certain condition test might want reproduce condition
testing requires internal knowledge system programming skill
It provides software test
Some Some testing almost always automated case form unit test
If done development take form Test Driven Development TDD
While Quality Checking focused defect identification Quality Assurance try prevent
QC product oriented intends make sure result expected
On hand QA focused process assure quality built
It try make sure correct thing done correct way
While QC important role past emergence Test Driven Development TDD Acceptance Test Driven Development ATDD later Behavior Driven Development BDD focus shifting towards QA
Both white testing necessary successful software delivery
In many case testing done dedicated tester testing performed developer
Emergence TDD ATDD BDD process supporting tool allows early defect detection shift focus QC towards QA
photo credit via The best way reduce bug focus QA QC remove safety net hold developer accountable produce working code
I like let team know taking support ticket directly customer
When safety net developer migrate towards test driven development writing simplest code possible get job done
QA QC crutch solution
Or distracted customer many direct request client request fix bug bug first place leaf company
The best way reduce bug depends type organization people working
In case company majority skilled code holding developer accountable produce working software probably best way go
However many company separate testing department
It common case department lot people without coding background
Assuming objective best utilize everyone avoid letting go must find way become productive
They often skilled testing domain expert
They valuable asset might used long manual testing way approach subject
They QCs converted QAs given enough time dedication
BDD one answer transition asset
In case best approach always look way utilize best way possible time try steer direction towards future improvement

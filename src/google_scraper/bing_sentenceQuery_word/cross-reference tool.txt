In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

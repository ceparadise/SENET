In process converting sequence character computer program web page sequence token assigned thus identified meaning
A program performs lexical analysis may termed though also term first stage lexer
A lexer generally combined together analyze web page forth
A lexer form first phase modern processing
Analysis generally occurs one pas
In older language initial stage instead performed removed whitespace scannerless parser separate lexer
These step done part lexer
Lexers parser often used compiler used computer language tool
Lexing divided two stage segment input string syntactic unit called categorizes token class convert lexeme processed value
Lexers generally quite simple complexity deferred parser phase often generated notably derivative
However lexers sometimes include complexity processing make input easier simplify parser may written partly fully hand either support feature performance
A sequence character source program match pattern token identified lexical analyzer instance token
Some author term token using token interchangeably represent string tokenized token data structure resulting putting string process
The word lexeme computer science defined differently linguistics
A lexeme computer science roughly corresponds might termed linguistics term computer science different meaning linguistics although case may similar
A simply pair consisting optional
The token name category lexical unit
Common token name Consider expression programming language The lexical analysis expression yield following sequence token A token name might termed linguistics
The specification often includes set rule defines lexical syntax
The lexical syntax usually grammar rule consisting define set possible character sequence lexeme token
A lexer recognizes string kind string found lexical program take action simply producing token
Two important common lexical category
These also defined grammar processed lexer may discarded producing token considered separating two token instead
There two important exception
First language delimit indenting initial whitespace significant determines block structure generally handled lexer level see
Secondly us lexers comment whitespace must preserved example also need output comment debugging tool may provide message programmer showing original source code
In notably whitespace comment eliminated part phase initial phase separate phase eliminated handled lexer
process demarcating possibly classifying section string input character
The resulting token passed form processing
The process considered input
Note field computer security different meaning
For example text string implicitly segmented space speaker would
The raw input character must explicitly split token given space delimiter matching string regular expression
The token could represented Or When token class represents one possible lexeme lexer often save enough information reproduce original lexeme used
The parser typically retrieves information lexer store
This necessary order avoid information loss case number identifier
Tokens identified based specific rule lexer
Some method used identify token include specific sequence character termed specific separating character called explicit definition dictionary
Special character including punctuation character commonly used lexers identify token natural use written programming language
Tokens often categorized character content context within data stream
Categories defined rule lexer
Categories often involve grammar element language used data stream
Programming language often categorize token identifier operator grouping symbol
Written language commonly categorize token noun verb adjective punctuation
Categories used token either parser function program
A lexical analyzer generally nothing combination token task left
For example typical lexical analyzer recognizes parenthesis token nothing ensure matched
When lexer feed token parser representation used typically enumerated list number representation
For example Identifier represented Assignment operator Addition operator etc
Tokens defined often understood lexical analyzer generator
The lexical analyzer generated automatically tool like lex read stream character identifies stream categorizes token
This termed
If lexer find invalid token report error
Following tokenizing
From interpreted data may loaded data structure general use interpretation
The first stage usually based FSM
It encoded within information possible sequence character contained within token handle individual instance character sequence termed
For example token may contain sequence character
In many case first character used deduce kind token follows subsequent input character processed one time reaching character set character acceptable token termed rule
In language lexeme creation rule complex may involve previously read character
For example C one character enough distinguish identifier begin string literal
A however string character known certain kind string literal sequence letter
In order construct token lexical analyzer need second stage go character lexeme produce
The lexeme type combined value properly constitutes token given parser
Some token parenthesis really value evaluator function return nothing type needed
Similarly sometimes evaluator suppress lexeme entirely concealing parser useful whitespace comment
The evaluator identifier usually simple literally representing identifier may include
The evaluator may pas string deferring evaluation semantic analysis phase may perform evaluation involved different base floating point number
For simple quoted string literal evaluator need remove quote evaluator incorporates lexer unescapes escape sequence
For example source code computer program string might converted following lexical token stream whitespace suppressed special character value Though possible sometimes necessary due licensing restriction existing parser list token small write lexer hand lexers often generated automated tool
These tool generally accept regular expression describe token allowed input stream
Each regular expression associated lexical grammar programming language evaluates lexeme matching regular expression
These tool may generate source code compiled executed construct plugged template code compiling executing
Regular expression compactly represent pattern character lexeme might follow
For example language IDENTIFIER token might English alphabetic character underscore followed number instance ASCII alphanumeric character underscore
This could represented compactly string
This mean character followed
Regular expression machine generate powerful enough handle recursive pattern opening parenthesis followed statement followed closing parenthesis
They unable keep count verify side unless finite set permissible value exists
It take full parser recognize pattern full generality
A parser push parenthesis stack try pop see stack empty end see example book
Typically tokenization occurs word level
However sometimes difficult define meant word
Often tokenizer relies simple heuristic example In language use space use Latin alphabet programming language approach fairly straightforward
However even many edge case larger construct purpose may count single token
A classic example New naive tokenizer may break space even though better break arguably hyphen
Tokenization particularly difficult language written exhibit word boundary
Korean also make tokenization task complicated
Some way address difficult problem include developing complex heuristic querying table common fitting token identifies collocation later processing step
Lexers often generated analogous tool often come together
The established paired parser generator free equivalent
These generator form taking lexical specification generally regular expression markup emitting lexer
These tool yield fast development important early development get working lexer language specification may change often
Further often provide advanced feature hard program hand
However automatically generated lexer may lack flexibility thus may require manual modification written lexer
Lexer performance concern optimizing worthwhile stable language lexer run often C HTML
lexers reasonably fast improvement two three time possible using tuned generator
lexers sometimes used modern lexer generator produce faster lexers one
The family generator us approach much le efficient directly coded approach
With latter approach generator produce engine directly jump state via goto statement
Tools like proven produce engine two three time faster flex produced engine
It general difficult analyzer perform better engine generated latter tool
The following lexical analyser handle Lexical analysis mainly segment input stream character token simply grouping character piece categorizing
However lexing may significantly complex simply lexers may omit token insert added token
Omitting token notably whitespace comment common needed compiler
Less commonly added token may inserted
This done mainly group token statement block simplify parser
feature language newline normally statement terminator
Most often ending line backslash immediately followed result line following line prior line
This generally done lexer backslash newline discarded rather newline tokenized
Examples include shell script Python
Many language use semicolon statement terminator
Most often mandatory language semicolon optional many context
This mainly done lexer level lexer output semicolon token stream despite one present input character stream termed
In case semicolon part formal phrase grammar language may found input text inserted lexer
Optional semicolon terminator separator also sometimes handled parser level notably case semicolon
Semicolon insertion feature distant descendent though absent B Semicolon insertion present though rule somewhat complex avoid bug recommend always using semicolon others use initial semicolon termed start potentially ambiguous statement
Semicolon insertion language statement line continuation language statement seen complementary semicolon insertion add token even though newlines generally generate token line continuation prevents token generated even though newlines generally generate token
The block determined indenting implemented lexer increasing indenting result lexer emitting INDENT token decreasing indenting result lexer emitting DEDENT token
These token correspond opening brace closing brace language use brace block mean phrase grammar depend whether brace indenting used
This requires lexer hold state namely current indent level thus detect change indenting change thus lexical grammar depend contextual information prior indent level
Generally lexical grammar almost thus require looking back ahead backtracking allows simple clean efficient implementation
This also allows simple communication lexer parser without needing information flowing back lexer
There exception however
Simple example include semicolon insertion Go requires looking back one token concatenation consecutive string literal Python requires holding one token buffer emitting see next token another string literal rule Python requires maintaining count indent level indeed stack indent level
These example require lexical context complicate lexer somewhat invisible parser later phase
A complex example C token class sequence character determined semantic analysis phase since typedef name variable name lexically identical constitute different token class
Thus hack lexer call semantic analyzer say symbol table check sequence requires typedef name
In case information must flow back parser semantic analyzer back lexer complicates design

Updated March Applies To Windows Server Windows Server Windows Server Windows Server When user authenticated Local Security Authority LSA creates access token case primary access token user
An access token contains security identifier SID user SIDs group user belongs privilege
If add user group access token issued modify privilege assigned user account user must log log access token updated
Whenever thread process interacts securable object try perform system task requires privilege operating system check effective access token determine level authorization
If thread impersonating effective token usually taken token thread
If thread interacting securable object impersonating token process examined access decision
Thus two kind access token primary impersonation
Every process primary token describes security context user account associated process
A primary access token typically assigned process represent default security information process
Impersonation access token hand usually used scenario
Impersonation token enable thread execute security context differs security context process owns thread
The table list APIs used create modify query access token
CreateRestrictedToken Creates new access token restricted version existing access token
DuplicateToken Creates new impersonation token duplicate one already existence
DuplicateTokenEx Creates new access token duplicate existing token
This function create either primary token impersonation token
OpenProcessToken Opens access token associated process
OpenThreadToken Opens access token associated thread
Tokens anonymous impersonation level opened
AdjustTokenGroups Enables disables group already present specified access token
Access required enable disable group access token
You enable group attribute
AdjustTokenPrivileges Enables disables existing privilege specified access token
Enabling disabling privilege access token requires access
ImpersonateAnonymousToken Enables specified thread impersonate anonymous logon token
To ensure token match operating concept anonymous access function called attempting network access generate anonymous token remote server
Anonymous token include Everyone Group SID unless system default overridden
ImpersonateSelf Obtains access token impersonates security context calling process
The token assigned calling thread
For function succeed DACL protecting process token must grant right
RevertToSelf Terminates impersonation client application
SetThreadToken Assigns impersonation token thread
The function also cause thread stop using impersonation token
SetTokenInformation Sets various type information specified access token
The information function set replaces existing information
The calling process must appropriate access right set information
information set access token created
CheckTokenMembership Determines whether specified SID enabled access token
GetTokenInformation Retrieves specified type information access token
The calling process must appropriate access right obtain information
IsTokenRestricted Indicates whether token contains list restricted SIDs
PrivilegeCheck Determines whether specified set privilege enabled access token
The PrivilegeCheck function typically called server application check privilege access token
For information token APIs search Authorization Structures Authorization reference Microsoft SDK documentation MSDN
An access token contains complete description security context process thread including information following table
User The SID account
If user log account local computer SID taken account database maintained local Security Accounts Manager SAM
If user log domain account SID taken property User object Active Directory
Groups A list SIDs security group include user
The list also includes SIDs property User object representing account Active Directory
Privileges A list privilege held local computer user security group
Default Owner The SID user security group default becomes owner object user either creates take ownership
Primary Group The SID primary security group
This information used POSIX subsystem ignored rest Windows Server
Default Discretionary Access Control List DACL A set permission operating system applies object created user access control information available
The default DACL grant Full Control Creator Owner System
Source The process caused access token created Session Manager LAN Manager Remote Procedure Call RPC Server
Type A value indicating whether access token primary impersonation token
Impersonation Level A value indicates extent service adopt security context client represented access token
Statistics Information access token
The operating system us information internally
Restricting SIDs An optional list SIDs added access token process authority create restricted token
Restricting SIDs limit access level lower user allowed
TS Session ID A value indicates whether access token associated Terminal Services client session
Session Reference Reserved internal use
SandBox Inert Nonzero token includes flag
Audit Policy Since Windows Server used per user auditing
Origin Introduced Windows Server
If token resulted logon using explicit credential token contain ID logon session created
If token resulted network authentication value zero
Each user group SID access token one two attribute control system us SID access check
The following table list attribute control access checking
A SID attribute enabled access check
When system performs access check check access control entry ACEs apply SID
Since Windows SID attribute SID
When system performs access check check ACEs deny access SID
It ignores ACEs allow access SID
Both attribute mutually exclusive
If one attribute set set
If neither attribute set SID ignored
Moreover process ever allowed remove attribute SID
SIDHistory used store former SIDs moved object security group
Prior Windows restructuring domain generally meant creation new account needed placed group old account placed
Since Windows domain restructuring made considerably easier result SIDHistory new attribute Active Directory security principal
APIs tool support utility built APIs update SIDHistory attribute object representing Active Directory former SID part move operation user group
When user log system new SID also old SID retrieved SIDHistory attribute added access token used determine group membership
The SIDs group user member either new SID old SID also added access token together SIDHistory group might
Because group moved also SIDHistory
The system also retrieves SIDHistory attribute group user member add attribute access token
Because SIDHistory entry token look system like normal group membership authorization check token grant appropriate access even earlier version system
Clients never get direct access network resource instead network service build access token impersonate client execute requested operation
The Windows operating system kernel us security identifier access token verify whether user authorized desired access right target object
There two kind access token primary impersonation
Every process primary token describes security context user account associated process
The primary token may assigned process represent default security information process
The access token built SID list acquired authentication
Group membership evaluated done Windows NT transitively
Since Windows chaining group possible native domain
This allows member group A member group B group A member group B
The following example user logging onto system
This occurs authentication either pas thru authentication NTLM creating ticket granting ticket service ticket Kerberos authentication
The user domain controller two following The system place SIDs received domain controller group SID access token
These group include following SID History No Yes No Yes No No Yes Yes Domain Local No No Yes system DC domain Yes transitive Global Yes transitive Yes transitive Â Â Universal No Yes transitive No No Impersonation token access token created capture security information client process thus enabling server impersonate client process security operation
Impersonation ability thread execute security context different context process owns thread
Impersonation designed meet security requirement application
When running security context service client degree
One thread us access token representing credential obtain access object client access
The primary reason impersonation cause access check performed identity
Using identity access check cause access either restricted expanded depending client permission
For example suppose file server file containing confidential information file protected DACL
To prevent client obtaining unauthorized access information file service impersonate client accessing file
Every process primary token describes security context user account associated process
In ordinary application process user associated process human user started application
In service process however service run account identity right
System service installed operating system run Local System local service Network Service account
Other service configured run three different account type Local System account service account local system service account Active Directory
The primary token service associated control thread service process thread acting behalf service
It identifies account group membership privilege
The service us information access check service request access object needed housekeeping
Then service accepts client creates thread work associate access token worker thread
Once associated way access token impersonation token identifies client group privilege
The impersonation information used access check thread request access resource behalf
When impersonation thread reverts using primary token return operating security context instead
A client process control extent service able act client selecting impersonation level connects service
By choosing impersonation level client tell service extent impersonate client
In word impersonation level described table define extent client agrees let service client
Users select impersonation level
One specified Security Quality Service SQoS information code application
There four impersonation level anonymous identify impersonate delegate
The anonymous level never supported
Prior Windows identify impersonate level supported
Windows added support delegate level
Anonymous The client anonymous service
The service impersonate client impersonation token contain information client
Identify The service get identity client use information security mechanism impersonate client
Impersonate The service impersonate client
If service computer client process access network resource client
If service remote computer impersonate client accessing resource computer
Delegate The service impersonate client access resource computer also access resource computer
This level supported Windows later version Windows operating system
Impersonation work delegate level following condition The way configure service account depends whether service run Local System account computer domain user account
A restricted token primary impersonation access token modified CreateRestrictedToken function
A process impersonating thread running security context restricted token restricted ability access securable object perform privileged operation
In Windows later application start child process restricted security context code executing child process limited access resource user
For example use software display Web page untrusted security zone code associated Web page execute fewer privilege computer
This feature used Microsoft Internet Explorer version earlier
Applications create restricted security context child process impersonation thread creating restricted token assigning child process impersonating thread
Restricted token created removing privilege applying attribute SIDs adding list restricting SIDs original access token
When restricted process thread try access securable object system performs two access check Access granted access check allow requested access right
For information restricted token see Access Control Microsoft Platform SDK MSDN
The following resource contains additional information relevant subject

operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Τhis sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

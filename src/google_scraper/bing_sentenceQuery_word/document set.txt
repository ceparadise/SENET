The next section list skill expected posse
While hard fast rule guarantee background skill required complete thesis Computer Science indicator
Here list indicator
Most thesis Computer Science consist two distinct part writing significant program writing paper describes program wrote
The intent document guide two thing
Of course need taken certain course read certain book journal article otherwise perform basic research begin writing program thesis
If thesis involve writing program skip section
Presumably thesis topic time start developing program implement demonstrate idea topic
You learned write program previous course usually program write thesis involved program written
Thus important use good software engineering technique
The requirement document explains program
Often requirement quite vague
For example system must fast system must
You want write set requirement serve contract specifying expected program
What requirement document
Abstractly answer simple statement valid input program statement corresponding output
Your software operate data derive computed data
The requirement document clearly state input data output data
The requirement document tell program perspective
The specification document explains requirement precisely requirement document
It restates requirement point view developer
The specification explicitly precisely stated
They statement design test
Essentially specification define function set possible data input data output program
The preliminary design document explains going fulfill specification
It written write program include list algorithm use major data structure list major function step use develop program
Stepwise refinement information hiding concept used developing program producing detailed design document
Understanding comment code important
Comments help understand done
It backwards write code try explain
Basic rule include giving selection iteration statement well block sequential code
Additionally loop invariant need developed iteration statement
Data structure use also need explained
Additional document sometimes required program
These include user manual maintenance manual test suite
Often appear appendix thesis
The user manual describes user interface program
The maintenance manual describes change augment port program
The test suite offer validation program compute intended describing test procedure sample test input
Most likely others use program
Writing good user manual facilitate use program
The important thing write naive user
It best assume user program know nothing computer interface
A clear concise description one us program great value others well
You identify awkward misleading command correcting develop much usable product
Start requirement document remind program
If work lasting benefit someone want extend functionality code
A well maintenance manual assist explaining code
The maintenance manual grows specification preliminary design detailed design document
The manual show program decomposed module specifies interface module list major data structure control structure
It also specify effective scope change code
How guarantee program meet specification
Formal verification one proof technique difficult apply large program
You familiar verification technique use develop code others still going want see code give expected result sample test case
Thus develop test suite used show program work correctly variety condition specifying testing procedure used variety test case exercise component program
I believe program written read understood person experienced programming
The basic method facilitating human consumption program write good internal comment discussed
Much sophisticated method exist one system developed Don Knuth
The original system written Pascal system language written even program called used generate system programming language
Briefly benefit using system enables develop program logically without constraint imposed compiler provide excellent program documentation modularity track variable module automatically
An index variable module produced containing pointer variable module defined used
To learn system refer cited literature
Your thesis paper document work serve basis publishable paper
The common mistake made thesis student assume thesis easy write
Consequently postpone writing completed programming
By time produce acceptable copy find term two school slipped still graduated
Important advice start writing early ask thesis advisor feedback writing
Equally important
Plagiarism result expulsion school
You expected write paper copy someone else written
It okay use people idea even word must clearly reference work
Your paper describe
Everyone make spelling mistake spelling checker program available type error eliminated
Always run written work spelling checker ask someone else read
Also find someone correct grammatical mistake paper
If necessary hire someone English Department Language Institute correct work give advisor
Also use professional document preparation system example WordPerfect allows print document laser printer
There
thesis style file developed produce correct margin format plus automatically handle many detail preparation thesis
You begin writing paper first quarter enrolled thesis credit

Good luck

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

In unambiguous specification solve class problem
Algorithms perform task
An algorithm expressed within finite amount space time formal language calculating
Starting initial state initial input perhaps instruction describe proceeds finite number successive state eventually producing output terminating final ending state
The transition one state next necessarily algorithm known incorporate random input
The concept existed century however partial formalization would become modern began attempt solve decision problem posed
Subsequent formalization framed attempt define effective method formalization included
Giving formal definition algorithm corresponding intuitive notion remains challenging problem
The word combination word named word
αριθμός meaning number
mathematician scholar whose name mean native region part
About wrote treatise Arabic language translated century title
This title mean Algoritmi number Indians Algoritmi translator Latinization name
widely read mathematician Europe late Middle Ages primarily book
In late medieval Latin English corruption name simply meant decimal number system
In century influence Greek word ἀριθμός Latin word altered corresponding English term first attested century modern sense introduced century
In English first used
English adopted French term late century algorithm took meaning modern English
Another early use word manual titled composed
It begin thus translates Algorism art present use Indian figure number two time five
The poem hundred line long summarizes art calculating new style Indian dice Talibus Indorum Hindu numeral
An informal definition could set rule precisely defines sequence operation
would include computer program including program perform numeric calculation
Generally program algorithm stop eventually
A prototypical example algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integer example others described example later section
offer informal meaning word following quotation No human write fast enough long enough small smaller smaller without limit trying write molecule atom electron list member enumerably infinite set writing name one another notation
But human something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite set They give arbitrary finite
Such instruction given quite explicitly form An enumerably infinite set one whose element put correspondence integer
Thus Boolos Jeffrey saying algorithm implies instruction process creates output integer input integer integer theory arbitrarily large
Thus algorithm algebraic equation two arbitrary input variable produce output
But various author attempt define notion indicate word implies much something order addition example The concept also used define notion
That notion central explaining come starting small set rule
In time algorithm requires complete measured apparently related customary physical dimension
From uncertainty characterize ongoing work stem unavailability definition suit concrete sense abstract usage term
Algorithms essential way computer process data
Many computer program contain algorithm detail specific instruction computer perform specific order carry specified task calculating employee paycheck printing student report card
Thus algorithm considered sequence operation simulated system
Authors assert thesis include Minsky Savage Gurevich Minsky But also maintain Turing


procedure could naturally called effective fact realized simple machine
Although may seem extreme argument


favor hard refute
Gurevich Turing informal argument favor thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm simulated Turing machine according Savage algorithm computational process defined Turing machine
Typically algorithm associated processing information data read input source written output device stored processing
Stored data regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm
In practice state stored one
For computational process algorithm must rigorously defined specified way applies possible circumstance could arise
That conditional step must systematically dealt criterion case must clear computable
Because algorithm precise list precise step order computation always crucial functioning algorithm
Instructions usually assumed listed explicitly described starting top going bottom idea described formally
So far discussion formalization algorithm assumed premise
This common conception attempt describe task discrete mechanical mean
Unique conception formalized algorithm setting value variable
It derives intuition scratchpad
There example assignment
For alternate conception constitutes algorithm see
Algorithms expressed many kind notation including processed
Natural language expression algorithm tend verbose ambiguous rarely used complex technical algorithm
Pseudocode flowchart control table structured way express algorithm avoid many ambiguity common natural language statement
Programming language primarily intended expressing algorithm form executed computer often used way define document algorithm
There wide variety representation possible one express given program sequence machine table see flowchart see form rudimentary called set quadruple see
Representations algorithm classed three accepted level Turing machine description For example simple algorithm Add described three level see
Most algorithm intended implemented
However algorithm also implemented mean biological example implementing insect looking food mechanical device
In algorithm basically instance written software software developer effective intended target computer produce given perhaps null
An optimal algorithm even running old hardware would produce faster result higher algorithm purpose running efficient hardware algorithm like computer hardware considered technology
The notion simplicity elegance appears informally Knuth precisely Chaitin Chaitin preface definition I show ca prove program proof would solve ibid
For given function multiple algorithm may exist
This true even without expanding available instruction set available programmer
Rogers observes It


important distinguish notion
procedure notion
mapping yielded procedure
The function may several different algorithm
Unfortunately may tradeoff goodness speed elegance compactness elegant program may take step complete computation one le elegant
An example us Euclid algorithm appears
A computer human computor restricted type machine discrete deterministic mechanical device blindly follows instruction
Melzak Lambek primitive model reduced notion four element discrete distinguishable ii discrete indistinguishable iii agent iv list instruction relative capability agent

Rarely must programmer write code limited instruction set
But Minsky show Melzak Lambek machine four general instruction conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO HALT
Knuth advises reader best way learn algorithm try


immediately take pen paper work example
But simulation execution real thing
The programmer must translate algorithm language execute
Stone give example computing root quadratic equation computor must know take square root
If algorithm effective must provide set rule extracting square root
This mean programmer must know language effective relative target computing agent
But model used simulation
Van Emde Boas observes even base abstract instead concrete machine arbitrariness choice model remains
It point notion enters
When speed measured instruction set matter
For example subprogram Euclid algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster programmer instruction available rather subtraction worse Minsky decrement
Per algorithm computed model known per Minsky demonstration Turing completeness requires four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT
Kemeny Kurtz observe undisciplined use unconditional GOTOs conditional GOTOs result programmer write structured program using instruction hand also possible hard write badly structured program structured language
Tausworthe augments three SEQUENCE two CASE
An additional benefit structured program lends using
The graphical aide called offer way describe document algorithm computer program one
Like program flow Minsky machine flowchart always start top page proceeds
Its primary symbol four directed arrow showing program flow rectangle SEQUENCE GOTO diamond dot
The canonical structure made primitive shape

One simplest algorithm find largest number list number random order
Finding solution requires looking every number list
From follows simple algorithm stated description English prose Written prose much closer language computer program following formal coding algorithm algorithm compute GCD two number appears Proposition II Book VII Elementary Number Theory
Euclid pose problem thus Given two number prime one another find greatest common measure
He defines A number multitude composed unit counting number positive integer including zero
To measure place shorter measuring length successively time along longer length remaining portion le shorter length
In modern word remainder quotient remainder modulus part left division
For Euclid method succeed starting length must satisfy two requirement length must zero AND ii subtraction must proper test must guarantee smaller two number subtracted larger alternately two equal subtraction yield zero
Euclid original proof add third requirement two length must prime one another
Euclid stipulated could construct proof two number common measure fact
While Nicomachus algorithm Euclid number prime one another yield number common measure
So precise following really Nicomachus algorithm
Only instruction required execute Euclid logical test conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement subtraction
The following algorithm framed Knuth version Euclid Nicomachus rather using division find remainder us successive subtraction shorter length remaining length le

Use remainder measure previously smaller number L serf temporary location
The following version Euclid algorithm requires six core instruction thirteen required Inelegant worse Inelegant requires instruction

Does algorithm author want
A test case usually suffice confirm core functionality
One source us
Knuth suggested
Another interesting case two number
But exceptional case must identified tested
Will Inelegant perform properly R S S R R S
Ditto Elegant B A A B A B
Yes
What happens one number zero number zero
Inelegant computes forever case Elegant computes forever A
What happens number entered
Fractional number
If input number
function computed include positive integer including zero failure zero indicate algorithm program rather
A notable failure due exception rocket failure June
Knuth demonstrates application extended version Euclid algorithm proposes general method applicable proving validity algorithm
Tausworthe proposes measure complexity program length correctness proof
With six core instruction Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant thirteen instruction
However Inelegant arrives HALT fewer step
indicates case Elegant conditional test every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant one
As algorithm usually requires many much time wasted B
test needed remainder computed
Once programmer judge program fit effective computes function intended question becomes improved
The compactness Inelegant improved elimination five step
But Chaitin proved compacting algorithm automated generalized algorithm rather done exhaustive search example found trial error cleverness insight application etc
Observe step repeated step
Comparison Elegant provides hint step together step eliminated
This reduces number core instruction thirteen eight make elegant Elegant nine step
The speed Elegant improved moving
test outside two subtraction loop
This change call addition three instruction B A GOTO
Now Elegant computes faster whether always case given A B R S would require detailed analysis
It frequently important know much particular resource time storage theoretically required given algorithm
Methods developed obtain quantitative answer estimate example sorting algorithm time requirement O using length list
At time algorithm need remember two value largest number found far current position input list
Therefore said space requirement space required store input number counted O counted
Different algorithm may complete task different set instruction le time space others
For example algorithm cost O log n outperforms sequential search cost O n used sorted list array
The discipline often practiced abstractly without use specific implementation
In sense algorithm analysis resembles mathematical discipline focus underlying property algorithm specific particular implementation
Usually used analysis simplest general representation
However ultimately algorithm usually implemented particular hardware software platform eventually put test using real code
For solution one problem efficiency particular algorithm may significant consequence unless n extremely large algorithm designed fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may critical
Scaling small n large n frequently expose inefficient algorithm otherwise benign
Empirical testing useful may uncover unexpected interaction affect performance
may used compare potential improvement algorithm program optimization
To illustrate potential improvement possible even well established algorithm recent significant innovation relating algorithm used heavily field image processing decrease processing time time application like medical imaging
In general speed improvement depend special property problem common practical application
Speedups magnitude enable computing device make extensive use image processing like digital camera medical equipment consume le power
There various way classify algorithm merit
One way classify algorithm implementation mean
Another way classifying algorithm design methodology paradigm
There certain number paradigm different
Furthermore category include many different type algorithm
Some common paradigm For specific classification algorithm algorithm problem may fall one general category described well one following Every field science problem need efficient algorithm
Related problem one field often studied together
Some example class algorithm
Fields tend overlap algorithm advance one field may improve sometimes completely unrelated field
For example dynamic programming invented optimization resource consumption industry used solving broad range problem many field
Algorithms classified amount time need complete compared input size Some problem may multiple algorithm differing complexity problem might algorithm known efficient algorithm
There also mapping problem problem
Owing found suitable classify problem instead algorithm equivalence class based complexity best possible algorithm
The adjective continuous applied word algorithm mean Algorithms usually patentable
In United States claim consisting solely simple manipulation abstract concept number signal constitute process USPTO hence algorithm patentable
However practical application algorithm sometimes patentable
For example application simple algorithm aid curing deemed patentable

simple way writing programming code English
Pseudocode actual programming language
It us short phrase write code program actually create specific language
Once know program function use pseudocode create statement achieve required result program
Pseudocode make creating program easier
Programs complex long preparation key
For year flowchart used map program writing one line code language
However difficult modify advancement programming language difficult display part program flowchart
It challenging find mistake without understanding complete flow program
That pseudocode becomes appealing
To use pseudocode write want program say English
Pseudocode allows translate statement language special command standardized
Writing program code enable better organize see may left needed part program
All write word short statement
Let look example
Let review example pseudocode
Compare pseudocode example flowchart add two number Now let look simple example pseudocode
Here pseudocode Now let look example pseudocode Remember writing basic pseudocode like writing actual coding language
It compiled run like regular program
Pseudocode written want
But company use specific pseudocode syntax keep everyone company page
set rule use organize statement programming language
By adhering specific syntax everyone company read understand flow program
This becomes cost effective le time spent finding correcting error
If would like format using pseudocode create program basic guideline First use command statement
Pseudocode universal
So creating task list would include command specific language like Java C Perl
The point pseudocode design program translated language
Second remember write one task statement per line
Make sure put one task line
Including much information one line confusing increase possibility error
Get FREE access day create account
Third make sure capitalize keywords
Capitalizing keywords like help show action occurring specific command process necessary coding specific language
Lastly indent statement loop better see flow program
Indenting become friend
It make thing easier read keep information together especially creating loop
For example If adhere four simple guideline using pseudocode helpful
Although pseudocode standardized use application software create text editor help organize program
If perpetual procrastinator may wait last minute work
So may leave lot time pseudocode flowchart
You find text editor support creation using specific programming language
For instance text editor may support Java may support
In review simple way writing programming code English become alternative flowchart
There standard special command pseudocode
Instead includes essential information creating program reader understands program without getting bogged detail
Pseudocode easy modify written paper using word processing application like Word Notepad
Some key point remember following By using pseudocode save time finding error

Pseudocode way writing code
It used design phase project quick way devising algorithm language used known without needing spend much time using exact syntax correct
Once pseudocode algorithm written easier use help write program code
Pseudocode structured way writing algorithm look much like program code
When devising algorithm programmer need use variable assign value
Many language require variable defined given data type use
The five basic data type used include Assigning value variable indicated pseudocode using arrow symbol
The arrow point value assigned towards variable assigned
The following line pseudocode read becomes equal
totalling
Sum Sum Number counting
Count Count The assignment operator also used finding total shown following example x becomes equal plus b
Similarly also use assignment operator counting assigning variable become equal value plus
INPUT OUTPUT
READ PRINT Output act returning data user program
This could form written message numerical value image video sound
This shown pseudocode writing OUTPUT followed output
The example show would output message World Sometimes word PRINT may used instead OUTPUT following example Input hand expect value provided user
The following example output message asking user input name assign variable called
The word READ also used instead INPUT
The use selection allows decision made within algorithm based certain condition
An IF statement start condition tested
If condition evaluates TRUE THEN code block run
If condition evaluates false ELSE block run
In following example Hello printed x otherwise Goodbye printed
Often ELSE IF used one condition check
The following example would print Hello x How
x otherwise print Goodbye
This structure used many possible outcome condition
For instance extend example suppose wanted program print different message depending value variable xː In example x print Hello x How
x I fine
x print Have good dayǃ
If x equal anything else print Goodbye
Iteration used need repeat block code
We make code block repeat either given number repetition continuously either long condition continues true condition becomes true
The FOR loop used repeat code given number repetition
We specify counter variable set initial value specify end value
After every iteration loop counter variable automatically incremented
In following example x start increase every time code repeat reach value loop terminate
A REPEAT loop repeat code block given condition true
The condition checked code run regardless whether condition true code always run least
The following example continue take user input user input value le
This structure often used validation check
In WHILE loop code block run continue run given condition longer true
A WHILE loop similar REPEAT loop decides terminate based condition
However loop check condition prior running first time
If condition true code block never run
The example also used input validation
Flowcharts alternative pseudocode
They used describe algorithm form diagram
Different symbol used represent different structure described
Below example flowchart algorithm

You fully understand
informal description operating principle computer program algorithm
It us structural convention normal programming language intended human reading rather machine reading
Common Action Keywords Several keywords often used indicate common input output processing operation
Example Question think Example Review code pseudocode
There suggested answer
Please paste run code Python Please see possible solution Click expand link see one possible solution NOT tried failed
The solution graciously provided Emiko grade student
When first building program really care actual LANGUAGE SYNTAX use
Rather care logic
help forcing think logically rather syntax

informal description operating principle
It us structural convention normal intended human reading machine reading
Pseudocode typically omits detail essential machine understanding algorithm code
The programming language augmented description detail convenient compact mathematical notation
The purpose using pseudocode easier people understand conventional programming language code efficient description key principle algorithm
It commonly used textbook documenting various algorithm also planning computer program development sketching structure program actual coding take place
No standard pseudocode syntax exists program pseudocode executable program
Pseudocode resembles confused without error
UML chart thought graphical alternative pseudocode spacious paper
Languages bridge gap pseudocode code written programming language
Its main use introduce student high level language use hybrid language
Textbooks related often use pseudocode description algorithm programmer understand even know programming language
In textbook usually accompanying introduction explaining particular convention use
The level detail may case approach formalized language
A need implement specific algorithm especially unfamiliar one often start pseudocode description translate description target programming language modify interact correctly rest program
Programmers may also start project sketching code pseudocode paper writing actual language structuring approach process step followed refinement
As name suggests pseudocode generally actually obey rule particular language systematic standard form although particular writer generally borrow style syntax example control structure conventional programming language
Popular syntax source include
Variable declaration typically omitted
Function call block code code contained within loop often replaced natural language sentence
Depending writer pseudocode may therefore vary widely style imitation real programming language one extreme description approaching formatted prose
This example pseudocode Fortran style pseudo code Pascal style pseudo code C style pseudo code Structured Basic style pseudo code In pseudocode often consists typically theory mixed control structure conventional programming language perhaps also description
This compact often informal notation understood wide range mathematically trained people frequently used way describe mathematical
For example sum operator product operator may represent selection structure one expression Normally used mathematical equation example mean markup language proprietary
Mathematical style pseudocode sometimes referred example origin concept
Here follows longer example Various attempt bring element natural language grammar computer programming produced programming language extent
In language parenthesis special character replaced preposition resulting quite talkative code
These language typically meaning variable declaration omitted
Such language may make easier person without knowledge language understand code perhaps also learn language
However similarity natural language usually cosmetic genuine
The syntax rule may strict formal conventional programming necessarily make development program easier
An alternative using mathematical pseudocode involving set theory notation matrix operation documentation algorithm use formal mathematical programming language mix mathematical notation program control structure
Then code parsed interpreted machine
Several formal include set theory notation using special character
Examples Some language include vectorized expression matrix operation formula mixed conventional control structure
Examples

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted An algorithm simply solution problem
An algorithm present solution problem well defined set step instruction
general way describing algorithm
use syntax specific programming language therefore executed computer
But closely resembles structure programming language contains roughly level detail
An algorithm give solution particular problem well defined set step
A recipe cookbook good example algorithm
When computer used solving particular problem step solution communicated computer
This make study algorithm important part computer science
An algorithm executed computer combining lot elementary operation addition subtraction perform complex mathematical operation
But translating idea algorithm computer code straight forward
Specially converting algorithm low level language assembly language could tedious using high level language C Java
When designing algorithm important analysis resource time storage required algorithm
Notations big O notation used performing time storage analysis algorithm
Algorithms expressed using natural language pseudocode flowchart etc
Pseudocode one method could used represent algorithm
It written specific syntax used programming language therefore executed computer
There lot format used writing pseudocodes borrow structure popular programming language C Lisp FORTRAN etc
Also natural language used presenting detail important
Most algorithm presented using pseudocode since read understood using programmer familiar different programming language
Some language Pascal syntax similar pseudocode making transformation pseudocode corresponding program code easier
Pseudocode allows include control structure WHILE FOR CASE present many high level language
An algorithm well defined sequence step provides solution given problem pseudocode one method used represent algorithm
While algorithm written natural language pseudocode written format closely related high level programming language structure
But pseudocode use specific programming language syntax therefore could understood programmer familiar different programming language
Additionally transforming algorithm presented pseudocode programming code could much easier converting algorithm written natural language

In computing system design loosely coupled system one component make use little knowledge definition separate component
Subareas include coupling class interface data loose coupling opposite tight coupling
Components coupled system replaced alternative implementation provide service
Components coupled system le constrained platform language operating system
If system decoupled time difficult also provide transactional integrity data replication across different system provides loose coupling creates issue maintaining consistency
Loose coupling broader distributed system design achieved use transaction queue provided middleware four type autonomy promote loose coupling reference autonomy time autonomy format autonomy platform autonomy
architecture also aim promoting loose coupling loose coupling interface enhanced publishing data standard format
Loose coupling program component enhanced using data type parameter
Passing customized data type object requires component knowledge data definition
Loose coupling service enhanced reducing information passed service key data example service sends letter reusable customer identifier passed customer address obtained within service
This decouples service service need called specific order Coupling refers degree knowledge one component another
Loose coupling computing interpreted encapsulation example tight coupling occurs dependent class contains pointer directly concrete class provides required behavior
The dependency substituted signature changed without requiring change dependent class loose coupling occurs dependent class contains pointer interface implemented one many concrete class
The dependent class dependency contract specified interface class implement interface thus satisfy dependency dependent class without change class

They developed classical system analysis Structured analysis became popular still use today
Structured analysis consists interpreting concept data control terminology represented data flow diagram
The flow data control bubble store bubble difficult track
One approach first define event world require system react
Bubbles need interact connected system defined bubble usually grouped higher level bubble decrease complexity
Data dictionary needed describe data command flow timeframe commercial programming done Cobol Fortran C BASIC

Information engineering circa Finkelstein popularised James Martin according Hay information engineering logical extension structured technique developed
Structured programming led structured design turn led structured system analysis tool began appear automated drawing diagram kept track thing drawn data dictionary
After example design manufacturing use tool named software engineering
Structured analysis typically creates hierarchy employing single abstraction mechanism structured analysis method employ IDEF process driven start purpose viewpoint
This method identifies overall function iteratively divide function smaller function preserving input output control also known functional decomposition approach focus cohesion within function coupling function leading structured data
The functional decomposition structured method describes process without delineating system behavior method identifies input output related activity
One reason popularity structured analysis ability communicate process concept
SOAP protocol specification exchanging structured information implementation web service computer network
Its purpose induce extensibility neutrality independence SOAP allows process running disparate operating system communicate using Extensible Markup Language
Since Web protocol like HTTP installed running operating system SOAP allows client invoke web service receive response independent language SOAP provides Messaging Protocol layer web service protocol stack web service
The server return SOAP response price location since generated data come standardized format requesting application integrate directly
SOAP designed protocol Dave Winer Don Box Bob Atkinson Mohsen Microsoft

Version specification however became recommendation June SOAP specification maintained XML Protocol Working Group World Wide Web Consortium group closed July
SOAP originally stood Simple Object Access Protocol version standard dropped acronym SOAP specification broadly defined consisting following conceptual component Protocol concept encapsulation concept Network concept
SOAP The set rule formalizing governing format SOAP Nodes These machine processing unit used receive process SOAP message
SOAP Roles Over path SOAP message assume specific role
The role node defines action node performs message receives example role none mean node process SOAP header way simply transmit message along path
SOAP protocol binding A SOAP message need work conjunction protocol transferred network example SOAP message could use TCP lower layer protocol transfer message
These binding defined SOAP protocol binding framework SOAP feature SOAP provides messaging framework
However extended add feature reliability security etc rule followed adding feature SOAP framework
SOAP module A collection specification regarding semantics SOAP header describe new feature extended upon SOAP module need realize feature
SOAP requires module adhere prescribed rule SOAP message Represents information exchanged soap node

Cohesion type measurement usually described high cohesion low cohesion
Modules high cohesion tend preferable high cohesion associated several desirable trait software including reliability understandability
In contrast low cohesion associated undesirable trait difficult maintain test reuse even understand
Cohesion often contrasted different concept
High cohesion often correlate vice versa
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured Design cohesion coupling published article book latter two subsequently became standard term software engineering
In method serve class tend similar many aspect class said high cohesion
In highly cohesive system code readability increased complexity kept manageable
Cohesion increased Advantages high cohesion strong cohesion While principle module perfect cohesion consisting single atomic element single function example practice complex task expressible single simple element
Thus module element either complicated order accomplish task narrow thus tightly coupled module
Thus cohesion balanced unit complexity coupling
Cohesion qualitative measure meaning source code measured examined using determine classification
Cohesion type worst best follows Although cohesion ranking type scale rank indicate steady progression improved cohesion
Studies various people including indicate first two type cohesion inferior communicational sequential cohesion good functional cohesion superior
While functional cohesion considered desirable type cohesion software module may achievable
There case communicational cohesion highest level cohesion attained circumstance

There two common meaning
One reference number word symbol take something particular language
Java criticized verbose language detractor take look COBOL
The much detail logged sent console needed debugging
A verbose mode produce lot detail
Unfortunately run programming equivalent Heisenberg producing enough debugging info try figure problem change timing enough make problem vanish
IBM created debugging instruction mainframe usually nothing little possible turned change program timing
Unfortunately available use customer IBM kept pretty secret
Still question
Ask

learn share knowledge build career
In computer science two definition word map
The first associative array type container map value one type value another type
An example
The second definition functional programming map applies function take list function applies function element list order return list result
What origin different definition map
I guessing second definition might come I sure derived another useful
The first definition make intuitive sense I sure came
Both construct define map mathematical sense mapping element one set another
Well mathematical meaning pairing element one set another

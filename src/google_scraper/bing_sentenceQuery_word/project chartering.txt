Exploring trend development project management today By Todd Fuller Formal chartering may step frequently overlooked organisation beginning project
Root cause analysis project failure often identifies poor vision lack charter key reason project go awry cancelled
Knowing developing good project charter apparently difficult
It certainly due complex technical reason like able find word processor advanced enough document information
There reason many project ineffective charter
The care nurturing project merely fraction job duty
Business manager simply need result
Many time feel responsibility complete simply identify problem someone like project manager assigned correct
If role project sponsor create charter may need training assistance order develop charter serf foundation future project work
Since business manager clearly identified problem someone assigned help PM often revert back duty leaving task PM
The rule come play If single task assigned two people equally take ownership completion
It clearly documented organisation project methodology role responsible developing charter
Many time project manager party business discussion leading birth project
Once assigned often seen sign weakness PM go back territory already covered
What PM want acquire reputation able jump foot get project moving
Revisiting lofty idea business objective goal critical success factor come across excessively focused achieving result
As result many PM move forward uneasy feeling missing something
As project manager role responsibility come chartering project
Well since probably control fund needed sponsor project unlikely gravitas favourite word previous election cycle charter
Basically come
The business manager often put together unsuitable charter
However mean accept shortcoming move forward anyway
Remember ultimately responsible success project best fact responsibility especially PMP insure appropriate charter place investing additional
Here item make certain addressed whatever chartering process organisation employ
If company even recognise concept chartering may need introduce concept little time walk process without using official sounding term like charter mission statement vision document
There single business manager interest enough project guardian funding representative rest management team
The person must understand business need objective project
If ca find one problem
Projects executed achieve business objective
If one care objective enough champion management asking project
The PM sometimes put position rarely effective
A project manager meeting business manager end like server favourite chain eatery
If find project without clear management rank best solution find one quick
Without one difficult spot soon
It rare PM push back demand business manager without succumbing de facto adoption every scope addition dream
A project without clear sponsor champion seen business manager free resource get done anything need even remotely related original objective
It like bill going congress manner additional spending get attached could stand
This result project many objective stakeholder project manager trying satisfy demand many master
Hopefully occurred project
This aspect chartering mostly outside control project manager aspect may influence
Project manager assigned early planning process possible
Often business manager assume planning goal objective critical success factor lofty aspect business project fall purview
However even project manager listen dramatically improve ability manage project later especially scope help achieve original objective try creep project plan
You push involved early possible project selection chartering process
Your success depends
If project already sponsor might assume business need already documented
This often case
Many time project sponsor instinctively know benefit formally describe document
If sponsor leaf company becomes disassociated project step fill void business need clear
Sometimes business manager volunteer champion project high profile wish involved way
If case project survive rough sea like company cutback new CIO want review every IT project
If business need documented well even project manager able explain value organisation
Understanding business value help keep team motivated
Most people perform higher level objective project significant impact
Even impact grand clear understanding value beneficiary keep team better motivated one certain project even executed
In case business value determined low project exist better know early avoid unnecessary spending organisation
If organisation initiate project anyway project manager understand increased risk losing funding road plan accordingly
Whether sponsor senior management project manager write project charter good one address following topic
There often conflicting opinion whether sponsor senior management project manager responsible developing charter
In theory best case sponsor develop charter realistically often delegated PM business need identified perhaps superficially project manager assigned
If charter developed discipline rigour participation appropriate key stakeholder writing stewarding process development becomes le important

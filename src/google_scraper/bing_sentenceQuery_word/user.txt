A person us
Users generally use system software product without technical expertise required fully understand
use advanced feature program though necessarily capable
A user often identified system
Other term username include derived identical term
Some software product provide service system direct
ultimate human user also referred software product
The term used abstract distinguish use software developer system enhance software end user
In also distinguishes software operator client pay development may directly use software help establish
This abstraction primarily useful designing refers relevant subset characteristic expected user would common
In design created represent type user
It sometimes specified persona type user interface comfortable due previous experience interface inherent simplicity technical expertise degree knowledge specific field
When constraint imposed category especially designing program use general public common practice expect minimal technical expertise previous training end user
The discipline blur typical distinction user developer
It designates activity technique people professional developer create automated behavior complex data object without significant knowledge programming language
Systems whose another system direct end user A user account allows user system potentially receive resource provided connected system however authentication imply authorization
To account user typically required oneself purpose logging
Once user logged operating system often use identifier integer refer rather username process known
In system username correlated

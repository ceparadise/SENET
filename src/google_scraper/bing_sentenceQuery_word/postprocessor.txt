In process input data produce output used input another program
The output said form input data often used subsequent program like
The amount kind processing done depends nature preprocessor preprocessors capable performing relatively simple textual substitution expansion others power
A common example processing performed next step compilation
In phase known
It also include macro processing file inclusion language extension
Lexical preprocessors preprocessors require operate source text prior performing simple substitution character sequence tokenized character sequence according rule
They typically perform file conditional compilation inclusion
The common example take line beginning
Because know nothing underlying language use criticized many feature built directly language
For example macro replaced aggressive inlining template includes import requires preservation type information object code making feature impossible retrofit language effectively accomplished dead code elimination language
However key point remember preprocessor directive start new line
Other lexical preprocessors include commonly used build system open source macro processor operates pattern context
Syntactic preprocessors introduced family language
Their role transform syntax tree according number rule
For programming language rule written language program reflection
This case
Some language rely fully external language define transformation preprocessor statically typed counterpart
Syntactic preprocessors typically used customize syntax language extend language adding new primitive embed DSL inside general purpose language
A good example syntax customization existence two different syntax programming language
Programs may written indifferently using normal syntax revised syntax may either syntax demand
Similarly number program written customize syntax language addition new operator
The best example language extension macro found family language
While language simple dynamically typed functional core standard distribution permit imperative programming well static typing
Almost feature implemented syntactic preprocessing although bear noting macro expansion phase compilation handled compiler Lisp
This still considered form preprocessing since take place phase compilation
One unusual feature family language possibility using macro create internal DSL
Typically large project module may written variety one perhaps using dialect another written dialect specialized etc
standard library contains example level syntactic abstraction form LOOP macro implement minilanguage describe complex iteration still enabling use standard Lisp operator
The provides similar feature external DSLs
This preprocessor take description semantics language
interpreter combining interpretation code generation turn definition compiler programming language either bytecode native code
Most preprocessors specific particular data processing task C language
A preprocessor may promoted meaning aimed specific usage programming language intended used wide variety text processing task
probably well known example general purpose preprocessor although C preprocessor sometimes used specific role
Examples

POST stand Power On Self Test
It diagnostic program built computer test different hardware computer
The POST process run Windows Macintosh computer
While exact test performed may vary machine POST sequence check vital hardware component
If test fail POST process return error message
This message may displayed screen may form beep blinking light
The common type POST error memory error
This caused one bad memory chip loose fully seated
If post process fails computer may need check computer manual see error code mean
If memory error may able fix problem removing reinstalling replacing bad memory module
If error caused another component may need computer serviced authorized technician
The POST process run quickly beginning load
Therefore likely notice unless error
If POST process finish without encountering error computer boot normally

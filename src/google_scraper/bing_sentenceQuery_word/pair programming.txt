technique two work together one workstation
One writes line code typed
The two programmer switch role frequently
While reviewing observer also considers strategic direction work coming idea improvement likely future problem address
This free driver focus attention tactical aspect completing current task using observer safety net guide
Pair programming increase required deliver code compared programmer working individually
Experiments yielded diverse result suggesting increase
However resulting code fewer defect
Along code development time factor like field support cost quality assurance also figure return investment
Pair programming might theoretically offset expense reducing defect program
A system two programmer posse greater potential generation diverse solution problem three reason In attempt share goal plan programmer must overtly negotiate shared course action conflict arises
In consider larger number way solving problem single programmer alone might
This significantly improves design quality program reduces chance selecting poor method
In online survey pair programmer stated enjoyed work programmed alone said confident solution pair programmed
Knowledge constantly shared pair programmer whether industry classroom many source suggest student show higher confidence programming pair many learn whether tip programming language rule overall design skill
In promiscuous pairing programmer communicates work programmer team rather pairing one partner cause knowledge system spread throughout whole team
Pair programming allows programmer examine partner code provide feedback necessary increase ability develop monitoring mechanism learning activity
Pair programming allows team member share problem solution quickly making le likely hidden agenda
This help pair programmer learn communicate easily
This raise communication bandwidth frequency within project increasing overall information flow within There empirical study pair programming
The empirical study tend examine level productivity quality code may focus bias introduced process testing publishing
A found pair typically consider design alternative programmer working alone arrive simpler maintainable design catch design defect earlier
However raised concern finding may influenced sign among published study pair programming
It concluded pair programming uniformly beneficial effective
Although pair programmer may complete task faster solo programmer total number increase
A manager would balance faster completion work reduced testing debugging time higher cost coding
The relative weight factor vary project task
The benefit pairing greatest task programmer fully understand begin challenging task call creativity sophistication novice compared expert
Pair programming could helpful attaining high quality correctness complex programming task would also increase development effort cost significantly
On simple task pair already fully understands pairing result net drop productivity
It may reduce code development time also risk reducing quality program
Productivity also drop pairing used without sufficient availability mentor coach
There indicator pair performing well also known pair programming two programmer different location working via shared desktop remote pair programming plugin
Remote pairing introduces difficulty present pairing extra delay coordination depending heavyweight tool instead lightweight one like index card loss verbal communication resulting confusion conflict thing keyboard
Tool support could provided

Pair programming collaborative learning method student program pair instead individually
This approach significantly improves college student programming competency increase likelihood male female student become remain computer science major
During pair programming student work tandem one computer completing regular programming assignment
The driver control mouse keyboard navigator make suggestion point error asks question
The partner routinely switch role gain benefit role

Pair programming refers practice whereby two programmer work together one computer collaborating design algorithm code test
The pair made driver actively type computer record design navigator watch work driver attentively identifies problem asks clarifying question make suggestion
Both also continuous brainstorming partner
Throughout world many university using pair programming computer science class number high school begun using practice well
Generally student much prefer collaborate work alone find computer science attractive forced work alone majority time
Between two student generally figure problem avoid pesky syntax semantic error cost many hour debug
Perhaps debugging session greatly reduced pair programming student vow never take another computer science course
Though educator may concerned half student learn pair programming pair programming shown help student learn fundamental skill individual level
At North Carolina State University NCSU University California Santa Cruz UCSC extensive pair programming study conducted approximately beginning computer science student almost year software engineering student three year period

It Friday evening
I lying bed phone hand reading class spread next
They conveniently slipped mind past half hour I pay heed I suddenly remember photo I posted Instagram yesterday
Guess work I church since I arrived Stanford week ago past Sunday minute
I accompanied incessant baby yelping cue every second group tourist taking Christmas card picture front main altar mother loudly whispering direction Managing Editor Introductory course CS adopted new pair programming policy SIMON Stanford Daily
This quarter Stanford Computer Science Department implement pair programming introductory computer science CS course CS Programming Methodology CS Programming Abstractions
Instead completing assignment individually student encouraged work pair within smaller discussion section
The purpose change reduce increasingly demanding workload section leader due high enrollment also help student develop important collaboration skill according CS lecturer Marty Stepp spearheaded change
Stepp teaching CS CS quarter
Having student submit pair enable u spend time giving detailed accurate grading feedback hope student learn joint programming experience Stepp wrote email The Daily
In light recent story increase CS honor code violation many speculated policy change attempt curb student temptation cheat
However professor computer science Eric Roberts explained case
This nothing recent story Roberts said
The section leader persistent problem introductory CS course pair programming potential solution department contemplating
It sudden decision Roberts said
We thinking long Students encouraged sit together write code time assignment separately compare code
They discouraged splitting part assignment taking turn entire assignment individually
Roberts taught CS winter also served Associate Chair Director Undergraduate Studies Computer Science explained pair programming reduce number assignment need graded help increase retention rate student section leading program
Section leader student CS Teaching Computer Science program help introductory CS class teaching weekly discussion session grading assignment exam holding help hour LaIR
Coordinator CS Reid Watson said pair programming gaining popularity among computer science educator
Many Stanford CS lecturer inspired try strategy campus hearing presentation pair programming attending ACM Special Interest Group Computer Science Education conference computer science education
According Watson discussion took place long recent honor code violation brought light
There discussion related honor code anyone Watson said
Watson explained section size two class remain student given option work pair
He belief student able produce higher quality code working others
When talk code partner lot time end writing better code another person need understand Watson said
We believe actually improve quality assignment lot student added
According Stepp CS syllabus quarter student still required complete exam assignment individually majority work allow collaboration partner
For assignment student required work pair incentivized
Only student working pair permitted take late day pair programming assignment
Working pair improve student learning giving someone talk stuck letting see different way approaching problem read Stepp syllabus
Section leader Rishi Bedi said really excited looking forward change
Pair programming present great opportunity new CS student strengthen understanding also better team member critical industry skill Bedi said
Roberts said department hope student might able learn better working friend
By letting people opportunity work together might get better experience peer mentoring Roberts said
Roberts also said idea whether change help reduce cause increase number honor code violation Watson emphasized quarter serve trial period
The pair programming option trial spring reevaluate effectiveness later quarter Roberts said
Tagged April Fools
Nope real Thus pushing assignment average grade even higher already
The section leader persistent problem introductory CS course Yeah turn dozen qualified section leader applicant CS program quarter based absurdly subjective criterion
Nice try Roberts

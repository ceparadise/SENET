amount time message take traverse system
In computer expression much time take data get one designated point another
It sometimes measured time required packet returned sender
Latency depends speed transmission medium copper wire optical fiber radio wave delay transmission device along way router modem
A low latency indicates high network efficiency
Latency two fundamental measure network performance
They closely related whereas latency measure amount time start action completion throughput total number action occur given amount time
Sending data large packet higher throughput sending data small packet smaller number packet header reduced startup queuing latency
If data sent continuous flow propagation latency little effect throughput system wait acknowledgment packet sending next resulting high propagation latency greatly reduce throughput
Latency also important consideration regard aspect computer particularly nearly instantaneous response required
For example Internet game high latency also called add difficulty determining player performed action first shooting opponent answering question
In playing musical instrument latency greater millisecond make difficult player get nearly instantaneous feedback require
The command widely used identify latency problem network

Latency delay input system desired outcome term understood slightly differently various context latency issue also vary one system another
Latency greatly affect usable enjoyable electronic mechanical device well communication
Latency communication demonstrated live transmission various point earth communication ground transmitter satellite satellite receiver take time
People connecting distance live event seen wait response
This latency wait time introduced signal travelling geographical distance well various piece communication equipment
Even limited speed light refractive index cable repeater amplifier along length introduce delay
expression much time take data get one designated point another
In environment example AT T latency measured sending returned sender time considered latency
Ideally latency close zero possible
The contributor network latency include special case network latency Internet large network
The factor determine latency Internet
However distance transmission medium number hop equipment server greater smaller network
Internet latency measurement would generally start exit network end return requested data Internet resource
length time take computer act signal telling stop decide response event
important factor determining Internet latency
A WAN busy directing traffic produce delay whether resource requested server another computer network elsewhere Internet
LAN user also experience delay WAN busy
In either example delay would still exist even rest hop including server desired data located entirely free traffic congestion
delay sound created heard
In sound created physical world delay determined varies slightly depending medium travel
Sound travel faster denser medium It travel faster solid le quickly liquid slowest air
We generally refer speed sound measured dry air room temperature
In electronics audio latency cumulative delay audio input audio output

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading article alternative method modulo reduction could understand following excerpt Those bold A single division recent processor
In contrast multiplication throughput one instruction every cycle latency cycle
Latency time start instruction result available
If division latency cycle calculate x b c result division available cycle
That division b start result available cycle result dividing c available cycle
The throughput one division every six cycle mean start another division every six cycle
So want calculate five division start cycle result available cycle
As exercise figure long take evaluate x b c b c z b c u b c v b c
Latency number processor clock take instruction data available use another instruction
Therefore instruction latency clock data available another instruction many clock start execution
Throughput number processor clock take instruction execute perform calculation
An instruction throughput clock would tie execution unit many cycle prevents instruction needing execution unit executed
Only instruction done execution unit next instruction enter

Hi need help
Add comment Latency time measure communication overhead incurred machine subsystem example memory latency tune required processor access memory
The time required two process synchronize called synchronization latency granularity communication latency closely Source Add comment On whole time scale time one portion inside technique tire anticipating yet another aspect
Response time therefore lost meter

submitted Latency measured second
millisecond
The multiplicative inverse would
hz
But call
Normally hz would associated frequency term seems considerably context
Edited clarity
Post comment
Responsiveness
deleted Well want lower latency
But normally higher number good
So convenient say want higher antilatency
deleted Well instead microsecond second would megahertz millihertz
Yeah make little sense measure way make sense convey frequency
Not necessarily
The frequency really make sense cyclic
So simple example one bit data transferred time frequency really well defined case even though time
The unit might work justified case I would argue also make sense convey frequency unless start talking maximum frequency carry assumption well
Exactly
Frequency inverse time inverse
The time syn ack may latency periodic even multiple packet
In case inverse minimising latency
Yeah frequency right term
I like responsiveness
Mathematically number I talking
Whether make sense actually use value could depend context sure
speed throughput
This kind depends question whether mean latency hardware networking etc
Throughput meaning
Maybe I stick antilatency
I see depends latency mean
Latency specific meaning time event inverse specific meaning apparently specific name
If considering latency time event might use inter arrival rate inverse
I would thinking along line previous poster consider latency term completion time coming storage background latency given time operation complete throughput would rate command completion given time period
arrival rate
Maybe
But rate sound bit much like throughput perhaps
Throughput latency completely different thing say
Throughput meaning
I thought reading question
Generally I would say latency delay first event throughput rate event happening first
It depends field though
normally higher number good That true
Latency golf score error level number turn path length waste thing might want minimize
Priority queue often implemented default
Minimizing absolute minimum also nice tell far optimal
If request query transaction take millisecond idealized sequential scenario perform sequential
These measure
In simplest idealized case single server processing request sequentially latency throughput may direct inverse context throughput seems answer question
However general relationship latency throughput dependent architecture system question affected factor like concurrency load request complexity network latency distance node involved request etc
I think best answer main difference generally talk single request throughput talk latency
concurrency You clarify say throughput particular thread
load request complexity In aggregate affect latency throughput equally
network latency distance node involved request These factor long comparing apple apple right
ie throughput latency throughput latency You clarify say throughput particular thread
Sure
Part I thinking look service outside fact say Google request latency tell anything useful throughput Google whole sense inverse relationship break even though may still exist level
Your point valid
I trying cover lot different scenario without getting specific
As thing get complex typically talk statistically term average distribution put bound latency throughput
I think misunderstand question
I mean multiplicative inverse latency value act latency
I misunderstand question
What asking exist
I giving way describe lack latency stated one reply
So convenient say want higher antilatency
If describing project product someone saying want higher ridiculous
Instead use term I gave
I get point term mathematical reason want use multiplitive inverse latency certainly exists divide latency
My context giving two number layperson represent two latency value
Trying always explain lower value better lead explanation actual unit nanosecond hence confusion
If I could say one value twice responsiveness still mathematically sound representation nonetheless make sense normal English
So yeah gon na go responsiveness

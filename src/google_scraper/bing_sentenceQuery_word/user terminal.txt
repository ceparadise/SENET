A electronic electromechanical device used entering data displaying printing data system
The example early day hardcopy terminal predated use computer screen decade
Early terminal inexpensive device slow compared input technology improved introduced terminal pushed older form interaction industry
A related development system evolved parallel made inefficiency user typing ability ability support multiple user machine terminal
The function terminal confined display input data device significant local programmable data processing capability may called smart terminal
A terminal depends host computer processing power called dumb terminal
A personal computer run software replicates function terminal sometimes allowing concurrent use local program access distant system
The terminal first working programmable fully automatic digital computer keyboard row lamp show result
Early user terminal connected computer electromechanical TeleTYpewriter TTY ASR originally used
Later printing terminal developed
However printing terminal limited speed paper could printed interactive use paper record unnecessary
By early many user computer industry realized affordable video data entry terminal could supplant ubiquitous permit new us computer would interactive
The problem amount memory needed store information page text comparable memory low end use
Displaying information video speed also challenge necessary control logic took rack worth electronics
One company announced plan build video terminal attracted large backlog order folded engineering plan included fabricating ICs proved ambitious
Another approach involved use specialized developed retained information written without need refresh
The announced shipped making one earliest terminal
It solved memory space issue mentioned using digital using rather later common choice
Early video computer display sometimes nicknamed Glass TTYs glass Teletypes Visual Display Units VDUs used individual primitive chip yet quickly became extremely popular device many different type computer system several supplier gravitated set common standard Starting late early dozen manufacturer terminal including many incompatible command sequence although many used early starting point
The great variation control code maker gave rise software identified grouped terminal type system software would correctly display input form using appropriate control code In system file stty utility TERM environment variable would used Data General Business BASIC software example sequence code sent terminal try read cursor position line content using sequence different manufacturer control code sequence response would determine number Data General Dasher terminal ADM terminal TTY special feature would available program say set code use
The great majority terminal monochrome manufacturer variously offering green white amber sometimes blue screen phosphor
Amber claimed reduce eye strain
Terminals modest colour capability also available widely used example colour version popular Wyse offered shade character cell
An intelligent terminal processing usually implying microprocessor built terminal microprocessor real processing input main computer attached would respond quickly keystroke
The term intelligent context date Notable example include predecessor introduced
From introduction user programmer could notice significant advantage VDU technology improvement yet programmer used feature new terminal later terminal example dumb terminal allowed programmer continue use older software
Some dumb terminal able respond escape sequence without needing microprocessor used multiple many single factor classed terminal intelligent ability within interrupting main computer send block data time example user finished whole field form
Most terminal early Data General DEC despite introduction ANSI terminal essentially dumb terminal although later ADM TVI model primitive capability
The advance microprocessor lower memory cost made possible terminal handle editing operation inserting character within field may previously required full character computer possibly slow modem line
Around mid intelligent terminal costing le dumb terminal would year earlier could provide enough local editing data send completed form main computer
Providing even processing possibility workstation like could run blurring distinction terminal Personal Computer
Another motivation development simplify reduce electronics required terminal
That also made practicable load several personality single terminal Qume could emulate many popular terminal day sold organization wish make software change
Frequently emulated terminal type included The escape code standard produced uniformity extent significant difference remained example ANSI mode terminal followed ANSI standard yet difference might exist code character attribute available field within form foreign character facility handling printer connected back screen
Most terminal connected often green amber screen
Typically terminal communicate computer via via cable often using EIA serial interface
system communicated using IBM protocol many computer many visual display supplier competing computer manufacturer terminal expand system
In fact instruction design originally conceived processor
While early single color screen terminal
The PC contain character generation hardware video signal video formatting generated PC graphic mode CPU software
An IBM PC monitor whether green monochrome display display technically much similar analog TV set without tuner terminal
With suitable PC could however emulate terminal capacity could connected mainframe minicomputer
The could booted terminal emulator mode ROM
Eventually personal computer greatly reduced market demand conventional terminal
In especially thin client combined economical local processing power central shared computer facility retain advantage terminal personal computer Today PC client provide emulation common terminal DEC using standard could run using software software Linux
Since advent subsequent popularization genuine hardware terminal used interface computer today
Using modern operating system like derivative feature mostly independent hardware used
When using GUI like one display typically occupied collection window associated various application rather single stream text associated single process
In case one may use application within windowing environment
This arrangement permit interaction computer running example without need physical terminal device even allow running terminal emulator device
A often sometimes serial computer interface text entry display
Information presented
When device use video display called visual display unit VDU video display terminal VDT
The text terminal used operate computer
Modern computer keyboard display console
Some operating system provide several text terminal single computer
The fundamental type application running text terminal command user executes command press
This includes environment
In shell command small application
Another important application type
A text editor occupies full area display display one text document allows user edit document
The text editor many us replaced usually provides rich formatting feature text editor lack
The first word processor used text communicate structure document later word processor operate graphical environment provide simulation formatted output
Programs control local terminal let user interact remote server
On work similarly
In simplest form text terminal like file
Writing file display text reading file produce user enters
In operating system several correspond available text terminal
For operation special program use easily via library
For complex operation program use terminal specific system call
For application simplest way use terminal simply write read text string sequentially
The output text scrolled last several line typically visible
system typically input text key pressed application receives ready string text
In mode application need know much terminal
For many interactive application sufficient
One common enhancement assisted library also may give access command history
This helpful various interactive
Even advanced interactivity provided application
Those application completely control screen layout also respond immediately
This mode useful
In addition program control color brightness text screen decorate underline blinking special character

To achieve application must deal plain text string also allow move arbitrary position clear portion screen change color display special character also respond
The great problem many different terminal set
In order overcome special created together terminal description database
Dumb terminal interpret limited number control code etc
ability process special perform function clearing line clearing screen controlling position
In context dumb terminal sometimes dubbed essentially limited functionality mechanical
This type dumb terminal still supported modern system setting
terminal also ability process escape sequence particular
A graphical terminal display image well text
Graphical terminal divided terminal
A display directly draw line face control host computer system
The line continuously formed since speed electronics limited number concurrent line displayed one time limited
display historically important longer used
Practically modern graphic display descended picture scanning technique used visual element rectangular array
Since raster image perceptible human eye whole short time raster must refreshed many time per second give appearance persistent display
The electronic demand refreshing display memory meant graphic terminal developed much later text terminal initially cost much
Most terminal today graphical show image screen
The modern term graphical terminal
A thin client typically us protocol like Microsoft Windows
The bandwidth needed depends protocol used resolution
Modern graphic terminal allow display image color text varying size color type face
In early industry consortium attempted define standard would allow single CRT screen implement multiple window behave distinct terminal
Unfortunately like suffered run closed standard unable obtain even minimal information realistic way small company independent developer could join consortium
Possibly standard disappeared without trace
A piece software emulates text terminal
In past widespread use broadband internet access many computer would use serial access program communicate computer via serial device
When first released program called used communicate many computer including
Dec Terminal one first terminal program popular
The Windows emulate physical terminal support program logging textually remote computer Windows including Telnet program bundled version Windows often incorporate code process escape sequence
The terminal emulator system example qterminal emulate physical terminal including support escape sequence
xterm emulate hardware terminal
Terminals operate various mode relating send input typed user keyboard receiving system whatever may There distinction key
In terminal switch mode pressing key block mode thing pressing key
Whilst key cause input line sent host mode key rather cause terminal transmit content character row cursor currently positioned host prompt
Different computer require different degree mode support terminal used computer terminal
The provided Unix operating system accommodate terminal rarely requires terminal mode since operating system required provide terminal device driver operating system local echo terminal performs line editing function host end
Most usually especially host system support terminal system always mode
In contrast terminal connected system always required block mode

By using keyboard enter query hitting specific key begin search system would locate answer print response paper used teleprinter
Terminals type gained popularity many publishing medium firm use electronic brain conducting fact check helped business constantly update maintain vast amount information sort data
Most early device required use punch card add information database
The punch card created using equipment perforate small rectangular card specific point along body card
Each card fed slot terminal allowing system read card convert information electronic data stored memory bank system
It stored data system would access query made translate data back common language use one teleprinter provide printout answer
With technological advance concept computer terminal began shift somewhat
Instead small number terminal connected idea network desktop connection via central server came
By workstation many business longer equipped device like typewriter featured monitor keyboard small enough fit typical work desk
In case newer terminal also included printer although many business opted use single printer service several terminal
As technology continued enhance electronic function newer system single printer individual workstation became common
Today computer terminal allows user connect data saved hard drive data stored common server within business also wealth information found Internet
This contemporary configuration terminal continuing undergo change
Advances technology make possible use laptop even handheld device remotely connect database enter retrieve data general perform task possible office setting
I one computer engineer think day computer terminal completely take individual workstation
While highly specialized computer workstation might still exist specific field I think general consumer end using terminal like computer system
The reason behind duplication data around world data exist individual computer creating huge sucking effect energy resource well physical resource
By moving data storage central processing central location essentially reducing waste world
A simple way think concept consider people get electricity Someday see computer consumer simple basic essentially input device allowing central server process application
One example already occurring Google document
This service offered Internet giant allows people use word processor right within web browser
My bos make u use computer terminal I work I absolutely hate
I think would much easier computer use instead terminal simply connects server
The problem terminal rely connection speed terminal central server giving data terminal period network busy clogged user extremely slow response time effect I able help client
This something employer consider looking purchasing computer terminal server solution
Ensure employee proper tool use job trying get done
This concept ensuring proper tool mean please efficient much happier work environment
Just previous commentor mentioned employer save significant amount overhead cost purchasing computer terminal system work server instead buying individual workstation
This type computer system possible application used individual worker simple enough work computer terminal
If looking high power software application use workforce might need consider use true computer work station individual workstation
Computer terminal traditionally used computing power
The first computer terminal actually based provided basic input output method I remember time people thought computer terminal would completely take computing industry
The concept behind cloud computing
While cloud computing seen new emergence much grander scale Google local level terminal use minimal
Often computer terminal used simply mean large organization reduce computer equipment cost
Perhaps one famous example computer terminal connected larger system retail cash register
These cash register operate information larger computer server still able act interaction point individual point sale

What difference Terminal Console Shell Command Line
The short answer Console terminal closely related
Originally meant piece equipment could interact computer early day unix meant device resembling typewriter sometimes called teletypewriter shorthand
The name came electronic point view name furniture point view
Very early unix history electronic keyboard display became norm terminal
In unix terminology particular kind implement number additional command beyond read write
Some terminal provided kernel behalf hardware device example input coming keyboard output going text mode screen input output transmitted serial line
Other terminal sometimes called provided thin kernel layer program called
Some type terminal emulator include The word also traditional meaning device one interacts computer typically keyboard display
For example X terminal kind computer whose purpose drive keyboard display mouse occasionally human interaction peripheral actual application running another powerful computer
A generally terminal physical sense definition primary terminal directly connected machine
The console appears operating system terminal
On system Linux FreeBSD console appears several terminal ttys special key combination switch terminal confuse matter name given particular terminal variation
See also
A interface user type command expressed sequence character typically command name followed parameter press key execute command
A primary interface user see log whose primary purpose start program
I know whether original metaphor shell home environment user shell program running
In unix circle specialized mean centered around entering name application one want start followed name file object application act pressing Enter key
Other type environment notable recent exception Gnome Shell usually use word example window system involve
There many different unix shell
Ubuntu default shell like Linux distribution
Popular alternative include emphasizes power customizability emphasizes simplicity
shell include flow control construct combine command
In addition typing command interactive prompt user write script
The common shell common syntax based
When discussing shell almost always implied shell
Some shell often used scripting lack advanced interactive feature include many variant
Pretty much system shell installed usually ash ksh bash
On Ubuntu ash variant chosen faster us le memory bash
In unix system administration user program invoked log
Normal user account shell user restricted access may specific command
account
The division labor terminal shell completely obvious
Here main task
A visual representation
Something sit work like bos
Some hardware bunch stuff
Another example console would video game console Super Nintendo play Actraiser Basically application running command
Basically anything input command
From Technically A terminal window also referred terminal emulator window graphical user interface GUI emulates console
In Our word A GUI Application access user console
instrument panel containing control computer A shell program provides traditional user interface Linux operating system A command line space right command prompt display mode computer monitor usually CRT LCD panel user enters command data The answer seem good
However dry technical taste I give end something terminates
For example take subway city station get terminal
Or airport place people come reach destination country considered terminal
The reason terminal airport nowadays place get people onboard place get plane obvious economic reason
A computer purpose get data something spit result
Thus terminal device get result screen example
It happened first computer usually input keyboard output screen single device
Because nowadays terminal considered device
A mouse keyboard screen camera terminal
OS thing
On computer kernel Ubuntu example Linux part
Now since kernel really shell provided program let user interact kernel easy way
That BASH example
dictionary flat surface contains control machine piece electrical equipment etc
That music industry board knob space shuttle command table considered console
Super Nintendo also called console historically since first entertainment device looked like box bunch button
interface opposite GUI
Namely two type interface computer CLI command line interface GUI graphical user interface
The main difference first one get input keyboard second get input mouse
These term often go together people use one term refer collection

usually obvious context mean terminal window providing interface command line shell
To keep getting I going say xterm XTerm Gnome Terminal Konsole mrxvt etc etc
Same bash
multiple specific meaning leave
Something provides human interaction program bidirectional stream ASCII character usually similar escape code processing

backspace delete arrow key etc
generate escape code
Programs print escape code move cursor around terminal screen switch bold text color clear scroll screen etc
In old day often dedicated appliance screen keyboard serial port
Now usually program like xterm
There device file program terminal virtual terminal also side accessible device file
This xterm writes input bash read
Every terminal including virtual one provides basic line editing cooked opposed raw mode
This handled kernel code
It bash provides line editing arrow key
Try running typing want see basic line editing like
Backspace work couple thing per stty setting
Even though lot kernel code behind terminal device would refered code terminal
Edit Gilles convinced referring tty terminal proper usage
Terminal Emulators interactive program run connected terminal dependent terminal semantics implemented kernel
Most behaviour standardised POSIX across Unix
A text editor depends behaviour Unix tty stuff well handling many feature terminal emulator
However physical screen keyboard serial port instance terminal
It require Unix kernel end serial port complete
Something completely different could sending escape code ASCII text receiving
It would though Unix terminal
A terminal emulator plus Unix tty semantics make full package Unix terminal program like bash normally run
style user interface type something press return make something happen
It also used shorthand shell like bash also say command line something like fdisk
Considering program use terminal UI two main family command line text
editor like vi
Command line program normally run terminal almost always still work input output redirected file program like editor email client would work
A program starting program
In Unix context common mean shell
Bourne shell C shell equivalent
Unix shell also read input file
shell script
They full programming language variable loop conditionals many program written bash POSIX shell feature portability
It also easily possible write quick interactive shell
Putting together shell like bash whatever program started running shell command receive character terminal device xterm writes input side
If run hit kernel tty code act send foreground process terminal
Note usage context mean Unix tty terminal emulator something hooked serial port
This happens shell put terminal cooked mode starting program mean kernel act
The tty code still nothing handling escape code control code
If instead xterm using Linux console text terminal kernel IS emulation handling stuff
Linux compiled without virtual console text terminal support without tty support
sometimes used synonym terminal KDE even terminal emulator called Konsole
As point also another meaning locally attached hardware
In kernel context console another specific meaning terminal boot message written
This serial port
Normally course text console implemented kernel top driver graphic hardware keyboard
If boot Linux command line get kernel message screen AND serial port
Linux implement virtual console
You swap one physical controlling
Typical Linux distros create start even ca want start log time flip command man page whatever else without running program like screen
Linux kernel includes terminal emulator provide terminal interface screen keyboard virtual console
The standard virtual terminal login prompt get back session X server grab next available virtual console
The X server open directly rather getting keypresses though
So swap text console mean press use terminal
Back computer slow much RAM people spent much time text console since fast could set nice font even change terminal size smaller character screen
swap console
disables console course leaving combo
So one term single technical meaning
It couple different one
Depending feel terminal proper terminal plus tty handling could say terminal also multiple meaning
To Summarize answer program command output like Linux
program past Before terminal monitor keyboard concept transferred like
So I open black window appear run run command
Console also Physical device
example Linux access combination
sometimes mean keyboard monitor attached computer
I think back early day computer every user terminal could get one
system operator console
The console could used task like rebooting machine getting system diagnostics possible user terminal
The console machine room intrinsic part computer whereas terminal could remote
The console would also include hardware light switch text input output
I would say command line area user type command whereas shell program command
The term shell particular Unix derivative tradition
The equivalent mainframe usually called job control language
Clearly original distinction become blurred time technology change
Trying short answer line enter command
Usually used tell need run something text mode window command line interface provided operating system
actual program run operating system process stuff enter
Hence name shell OS core
It provides command prompt run command apps
You always work program never operate console terminal directly
window text mode program running
This window process key press know width height
Can fullscreen
device display human accepts input stream character show
There feedback user height width hack keyboard keypresses char travelling
Terminal process special sequence stream make thing colored clean screen nasty thing
Terminals flaky easy mess thing file piping output contains special sequence
They popular networking device debug interface need single stream sending output control output device conversation without need initialize create window
console process input stream like terminal
This vague topic term ambiguous
I strongly recommend reading link I provided throughout answer also source answer
A layer kernel A many meaning A many meaning Often operating system allow run multiple console physical console console definition
These called
accessed combination
For example want open virtual console use combination
Consoles definition might appear anachronism expert comfortable using since many OSes support GUI
Also GUI stop responding console may still work
Most nowadays strictly speaking
It type working system time basic interface offered system
In fact everything including GUI build top
Collocquially terminal may also refer computer network
refers hardware interface terminal

console nowadays mostly one
The window colloquially referred console shell connected terminal system via virtual console
Back day computer expensive facility might one actual computer several terminal connecting via serial cable serial console
The OS operation etc
carried physical Computer input output happened console
I know unbuntu distros swtich virtual terminal pressing leftover time
Today concept thin client go back direction centralizing massive amount ressources providing enough hardware provide state art interface actual workplace
engine see terminal
It provides interop system add nice feature like variable
It translates back forth actual OS kernel us system call
System call shell bit like coding shell least give
refers method exchanging input output via
Strictly speaking line type current command line
The method general correctly referred CLI

I tested Ubuntu Debian
When I I get But I use dropdown menu help say
Does mean I using
Or xterm
Or extension xterm
I confused
The variable use application take advantage capability terminal
For example program want display colored text must first find terminal using support colored text colored text
The way work system keep library known terminal capability
On system also termcap legacy used much
So let say program want display red text
It basically make call terminfo library say
Then take byte print
You try
This get terminfo capability pas parameter color want
Now let say shiny new terminal emulator released system terminfo library definition yet
When application go look something fail terminal known
The way terminal get around lying
So gnome terminal saying
Xterm basic terminal around since dawn thus terminal emulator support support
So gnome terminal saying xterm likely definition terminfo library
The downside lying terminal type terminal might actually support lot xterm example many new terminal support color older terminal supported
So tradeoff get feature compatibility
Most terminal opt compatibility thus choose advertise
If want override many terminal offer way configuring behavior
But also
The environment variable indicates terminal terminal
specific purpose tell application running terminal interact terminal
Applications interact terminal writing escape sequence sequence character include nonprintable character effect moving cursor erasing part screen changing current color etc
In old day different brand physical terminal different set escape sequence
Therefore operating system maintains database terminal type characteristic
The traditional database many modern system application switched
Both database indexed name terminal type application query using terminal type name environment variable
Nowadays terminal use common set extension wo see many different value
Most GUI terminal emulator compatible traditional X terminal still used maintained
Terminal emulator differ xterm may add entry terminal database name
However mesh well remote shell
A program running machine A displaying machine B example launched ssh B A need query terminal database machine A
Remote login method ssh carry environment variable helpful B terminal database also entry value user A
Therefore many terminal emulator stick pretty much universally known
The differentiation terminal large come way application interact way terminal interact user fit environment
For example Gnome Terminal look good Gnome provides tab nicety Konsole look good KDE provides tab nicety urxvt small memory requirement run Windows screen tmux provide session attached different parent terminal
Since none feature make difference application running terminal terminal emulator use
To find terminal shell running look parent shell The environment variable TERM mean terminal using
The environment variable TERM contains identifier text window capability
You get detailed list cababilities using command using reference
When producing text embedded color directive msgcat look TERM variable
Text window today typically support least color
Often however text window support color even though TERM variable set identifier denoting supported color
It worth setting TERM variable different value case case built support color
It also built support color
You try set TERM either
rxvt often built support color
You try set TERM
konsole often built support color
You try set TERM
After setting TERM verify invoking seeing whether output look like reasonable color map
The environment variable TERM contains identifier text window capability
You get detailed list cababilities using command using reference

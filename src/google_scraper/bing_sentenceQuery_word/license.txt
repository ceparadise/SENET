The computer engineer creating software run people life may need registration
Hemera Images A computer engineer work role software development
He deal drainage gear assembly line physical world sense engineer forty year ago
Yet world virtual new reality computer engineer influence almost universal
Because influence professional registration add additional layer confidence product computer engineer produce
The NCEES National Council Examiners Engineers Surveyors organization state use test competency potential professional engineer
Testing software engineer begin testing cycle follow pattern engineering specialty
The initial part examination software engineer test basic skill
This followed internship licensed engineer field
Later come final exam test specialized knowledge practical application
In fashion state say engineer regardless type plan call engineer must hold state license professional engineer PE
The computer engineer plan open office need registration wish advertise service public describe engineer
State registration also allows public determine whether official complaint pending license
A computer engineer work industry giant almost certainly find working supervision licensed PE although supervision may dozen level corporate bureaucracy
This mean PE designation necessary although lack designation limit engineer upward mobility
If engineer plan remain within corporate cocoon entire career registration unnecessary
While registration necessary computer engineer working supervision PE computer engineer call engineer order get job PE designation tell potential employer computer engineer least four year responsible supervised experience least certain level competency
Additionally say job candidate enough moxie stick demanding registration process
Ultimately question registration requirement state

However using computer understanding operate two different thing school employ educator trained teach computer science student
By definition computer science field focus understanding design computer computational process
While computer scientist concerned algorithm others focus development implementation hardware software
At college university level computer science overlap several allied field including information technology computer engineering
Those interest teach computer science look forward abundance job opening starting high school level
As technology becomes increasingly significant part world employment opportunity related academic continue grow especially posse advanced degree field
While computer science taught elementary middle school level class many school employ medium study teacher serve school library resource teacher especially elementary level
In many respect medium study misleading term teacher since typically teach concept overlap medium study postsecondary level
They however educate student basic computing skill case offer introductory level lesson computer science
An elementary middle school medium study teacher may also introduce student basic computer function basic programming language HTML
Despite growing demand incorporate computer science earlier level elementary middle school curriculum nearly always focus teaching student use computer rather teaching student computer work
Individuals interest teaching computer science topic elementary middle school must complete following Not surprisingly growing demand provide computer science course high school student
Both industry leader organization like Computer Science Teachers Association continue make compelling argument favor offering computer science course core part high school curriculum
While subject available elective various high school across nation report reveal United States offer computer science course state permit computer science education count towards student high school diploma
By close half state introduced policy allow computer science course count mathematics science credit high school level
Several state process introducing legislation would integrate computer science school even
Despite intense lobbying industry still long way go
For example field requirement option vary according state
In state computer science course offered teacher hold mathematics science certified teach state simply passion field

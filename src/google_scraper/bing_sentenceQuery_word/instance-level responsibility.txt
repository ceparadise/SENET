A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn

I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Traditionally philosophical discussion moral responsibility focused human component moral action
Accounts ascribe moral responsibility usually describe human agent performing action direct consequence
In increasingly technological society however human activity properly understood without making reference technological artifact complicates ascription moral responsibility Jonas Waelbers
As interact artifact affect decision make make Latour
They persuade facilitate enable particular human cognitive process action attitude constraining discouraging inhibiting others
For instance internet search engine prioritize present information particular order thereby influencing Internet user get see
As Verbeek point technological artifact active mediator actively people world perception action experience existence
As active mediator change character human action result challenge conventional notion distribute moral responsibility Jonas Johnson
Computing present particular case understanding role technology moral responsibility
As technology become integral part daily activity automate process continue transform way people communicate relate complicate already problematic task attributing moral responsibility
The growing pervasiveness computer technology everyday life growing complexity technology new possibility provide raise new kind question responsible information published Internet
Who accountable electronic record lost contain error
To extent period time developer computer technology accountable untoward consequence product
And computer technology become complex behave increasingly autonomous human still held responsible behavior technology
This entry first look challenge computing pose conventional notion moral responsibility
The discussion review two different way various author addressed challenge reconsidering idea moral agency rethinking concept moral responsibility
Moral responsibility human action consequence
Generally speaking person group people morally responsible voluntary action morally significant outcome would make appropriate blame praise
Thus may consider person moral responsibility jump water try rescue another person see person drowning
If manages pull person water likely praise whereas refuse help may blame
Ascribing morally responsibility establishes link person group people subject someone something object affected action subject
This done retrospectively well prospectively
That sometimes ascription responsibility involve giving account fault accident punished
It also prospectively determining obligation duty person fulfill future ought
However always clear ascription moral responsibility appropriate
On one hand concept varying meaning debate continue set moral responsibility apart kind responsibility Hart
The concept intertwined sometimes overlap notion accountability liability blameworthiness causality
Opinions also differ condition warrant attribution moral responsibility whether requires agent free whether human entity moral responsibility attributed see entry
On hand difficult establish direct link subject object complexity involved human activity particular today technological society
Individuals institution generally act system task distributed among human technological component mutually affect contingent way
Increasingly complex technology exacerbate difficulty identifying responsible
When something go wrong retrospective account happened expected complex system challenging task ascribing responsibility Johnson Powers
The increasing pervasiveness computer technology pose various challenge figuring moral responsibility entail properly ascribed
To explain computing complicates ascription responsibility consider condition make sense hold someone responsible
Despite ongoing philosophical debate issue analysis moral responsibility share least following three condition Eshelman Jonas A closer look three condition show computing complicate applicability condition
In order person held morally responsible particular event able exert kind influence event
It make sense blame someone accident could avoided acting differently control event leading accident
However computer technology obscure causal connection person action eventual consequence
Tracing sequence event led incident usually lead many direction incident seldom result single error mishap
Technological accident commonly product accumulation mistake misunderstanding negligent behavior various individual involved development use maintenance computer system including designer engineer technician regulator manager user manufacturer seller resellers even policy maker
The contribution multiple actor development deployment technology known problem many hand Friedman Nissenbaum Jonas
One example problem many hand computing case malfunctioning radiation treatment machine Leveson Turner Leveson
This machine designed radiation treatment cancer patient well
During period machine massively overdosed six patient contributing eventual death three
These incident result combination number factor including software error inadequate testing quality assurance exaggerated claim reliability bad interface design overconfidence software design inadequate investigation accident report
Nevertheless analysis event Leveson Turner conclude hard place blame single person
The action negligence involved might proven fatal contributing event
This say moral responsibility case Nissenbaum Gotterbarn many actor could acted differently make difficult retrospectively identify appropriate person called upon answer make amends outcome
Adding problem many hand temporal physical distance computing creates person consequence action distance blur causal connection action event Friedman
Computational technology extend reach human activity time space
With help social medium communication technology people interact others side world
Satellites advanced communication technology allow pilot fly drone Afghanistan station United States
These technology enable people act greater distance remoteness dissociate original action eventual consequence Waelbers
When person us technological artifact perform action thousand mile way person might know people affected might directly partially experience consequence
This reduce sense responsibility person feel may interfere ability fully comprehend significance action
Similarly designer automated system determine ahead time decision made rarely see decision impact individual affect
Their original action programming system may effect people year later
The problem many hand distancing effect use technology illustrate mediating role technological artifact confusion moral responsibility
Technological artifact bring together various different intention creator user
People create deploy technology objective producing effect world
Software developer develop Internet filter often request manager client aim shielding particular content user influencing user read
The software inscribed design various intention developer manager client poised behave given particular input according idea information appropriate Friedman
Moral responsibility therefore attributed without looking causal efficacy artifact constrain enable particular human activity
However technological artifact determine human action
They isolated instrument mean work regardless context used interpretive flexibility Bijker et al

Although design technology provides set condition action form meaning action result human agent choose use technology particular context
People often use technology way unforeseen designer
This interpretive flexibility make difficult designer anticipate possible outcome use technology
The mediating role computer technology complicates effort retrospectively tracing back causal connection action outcome also complicates responsibility
As computer technology shape people perceive experience world affect second condition attributing moral responsibility
In order make appropriate decision person able consider deliberate consequence action
She aware possible risk harm action might cause
It unfair hold someone responsible something could known action might lead harm
On one hand computer technology help user think action choice may lead
They help user capture store organize analyze data information Zuboff
For example one advantage robot used armed force rescue worker enable operator acquire information would able available without
They allow operator look beyond next hill around next corner thus help operator reflect consequence particular tactical decision might US Department Defense
On hand use computer constrain ability user understand consider outcome action
These complex technology never fully free error increasingly hide automated process behind interface Van den Hoven
Users see part many computation computer performs part unaware performs usually partial understanding assumption model theory information computer screen based
The opacity many computer system get way assessing validity relevance information prevent user making appropriate decision
People tendency either rely much enough accuracy automated system Cummings Parasuraman Riley
A ability act responsibly example suffer distrust automation result high rate false alarm
In Therac case one machine operator testified become used many cryptic error message machine gave involve patient safety
She tended ignore therefore failed notice machine set overdose patient
Too much reliance automated system equally disastrous consequence
In missile cruiser
Vincennes shot Iranian civilian jet airliner killing passenger onboard mistakenly identified airliner attacking military aircraft Gray
The cruiser equipped Aegis defensive system could automatically track target incoming missile enemy aircraft
Analyses event leading incident showed overconfidence ability Aegis system prevented others intervening could
Two warship nearby correctly identified aircraft civilian
Yet dispute Vincennes identification aircraft military aircraft
In later explanation Richard Thomas one nearby ship stated We called always seemed She always seemed telling everybody get link though picture better quoted Gray
The captain ship thought sophisticated Aegis system provided crew Vincennes information
Considering possible consequence one action complicated computer technology make possible human thing could
Computer technology created new mode conduct new social institution new vice new virtue new way helping new way abusing people Ladd
The social legal convention govern new mode conduct take time emerge initial absence convention contributes confusion responsibility
For example ability user upload share text video image publicly Internet raise whole new set question responsible content uploaded material
Such question heart debate conviction three Google executive Italy violation data protection act Sartor Viola de Azevedo Cunha
The case concerned video YouTube four student assaulting disabled person
In response request Italian Postal Police Google owner YouTube took video two month student uploaded
The judge nonetheless ruled Google criminally liable processing video without taking adequate precautionary measure avoid privacy violation
The judge also held Google liable failing adequately inform student uploaded video data protection obligation
In ensuing debate verdict critical ruling insisted threatened freedom expression Internet set dangerous precedent used authoritarian regime justify web censorship see also Singel
Moreover claimed platform provider could held responsible action user could realistically approve every upload job censure
Yet others instead argued would immoral Google exempt liability damage others suffered due Google profitable commercial activity
Cases like one show confusion possibility limitation new technology difficult determine one moral obligation others
The lack experience new technological innovation also affect count negligent use technology
In order operate new computer system user typically go process training familiarization system
It requires skill experience understand imagine system behave Coeckelbergh Wackers
Friedman describes case programmer invented experimenting computer worm piece code replicate
At time relatively new computational entity
The programmer released worm Internet experiment quickly got control code replicated much faster expected see also Denning
Today would find satisfactory excuse familiar become computer worm virus
However Friedman pose question whether programmer really acted negligent way consequence truly unanticipated
Does computer community lack experience particular type computational entity influence judge negligent behavior
The freedom act probably important condition attributing moral responsibility also one contested
We tend excuse people moral blame choice act way
We typically hold people responsible coerced forced take particular action
The freedom act also mean person free autonomy Fisher
Someone held morally responsible act basis authentic thought motivation capacity control behavior Johnson
Nevertheless little consensus capacity human being entity enables act freely see entry
Does require rationality emotion intentionality cognition
Indeed one important debate moral philosophy center question whether human being really autonomy free
And moral responsibility still attributed Eshleman
In practice attributing autonomy free human basis fulfillment set condition turn le straightforward endeavor
We attribute autonomy person degree
An adult generally considered autonomous child
As individual society autonomy thought vary manipulated controlled influenced force outside parent peer pressure
Moreover internal physical psychological influence addiction mental problem perceived constraining autonomy person
Computing like technology add additional layer complexity determining whether someone free act affect choice human make
One biggest application area computing automation process control
Automation help centralize increase control multiple process charge limit discretionary power human operator chain
An example provided automation public administration Bovens Zouridis
Large public sector organization last decade progressively standardized formalized production process
The process issuing decision student loan speeding ticket tax return carried almost entirely computer system
This reduced scope administrative discretion many official tax inspector welfare worker policy officer deciding apply formal policy rule individual case
Citizens longer interact official significant responsibility applying knowledge rule regulation decide appropriate would better let someone warning speeding ticket required
Rather decision algorithm apply measure rule regardless person context speeding camera care context
Responsibility decision made case moved bureaucrat bureaucrat manager computer expert decide convert policy legal framework algorithm
The automation bureaucratic process illustrates computer technology intentionally designed limit discretion human being
Indeed relatively new field Persuasive Technology explicitly aim develop technological artifact persuade human perform desirable way IJsselsteijn et al

An example lock already use number country including USA Canada Sweden UK
It requires driver pas breathing test start car
This technology force particular kind action leaf driver hardly choice
Other technology might subtle way steering behavior either persuading seducing user Verbeek
For example onboard computer device car show information fuel consumption encourage driver optimize fuel efficiency
Such technology designed explicit aim making human behave responsibly limiting option persuading choose certain way
Verbeek note critic idea intentionally developing technology enforce morally desirable behavior argued jettisons democratic principle society threatens human dignity
They argue deprives human ability right make deliberate decision act voluntarily
In addition critic claimed human acting freely action considered moral
These objection countered Verbeek argues pointing rule norm regulation host technological artifact already set condition action human able allowed perform
Moreover note technological artifact active mediator affect action experience human determine
Some people creatively circumvented strict morality alcohol lock air pump car Vidal
Nevertheless critique underline issue stake automating process computing set constraint freedom person act thus affect extent held morally responsible
The challenge computer technology present regard condition ascribing responsibility indicate limitation conventional ethical framework dealing question moral responsibility
Traditional model moral responsibility seem developed kind action performed individual directly visible consequence Waelbers
However today society attribution responsibility individual group individual intertwined artifact interact well intention action human agent artifact mediate
Acting computer technology may require different kind analysis held responsible mean morally responsible
Moral responsibility generally attributed moral agent least Western philosophical tradition moral agency concept exclusively reserved human being Johnson
Unlike animal natural disaster human being tradition originator morally significant action freely choose act one way rather another way deliberate consequence choice
And although people inclined anthropomorphize computer treat moral agent Reeves Nass philosopher agree current computer technology called moral agent would mean could held morally responsibility
However limitation traditional ethical vocabulary thinking moral dimension computing led author rethink concept moral agency
The increasing complexity computer technology advance Artificial Intelligence AI challenge idea human being entity moral responsibility ascribed Bechtel
Dennett example suggests holding computer morally responsible possible concerned intentional computer system
An intentional system according one predicted explained attributing belief desire well rationality
In word behavior described assuming system mental state act according think ought given belief desire
Many computer today according Dennett already intentional system lack ability reflect reason mental state
They belief belief thought desire
Dennett suggests fictional HAL featured movie would qualify intentional system held morally responsible
Although current advance AI might lead HAL see development computer system intentionality real possibility
Sullins argues line Dennett moral agency require personhood
He proposes computer system specifically robot moral agent significant level autonomy regarded appropriate level abstraction exhibiting intentional behavior
A robot according Sullins would significantly autonomous direct control agent performing task
However add third condition robot also position responsibility moral agent
That robot performs social role carry responsibility performing role robot appears belief understanding duty towards moral agent
To illustrate kind capability required full moral agency draw analogy human nurse
He argues robot autonomous enough carry duty human nurse understanding role responsibility health care system would full moral agent
Sullins maintains time machine kind capability offer even modest robot today seen moral agent sort certain level abstraction deserving moral consideration
Echoing objection early project strong AI Sack critic analysis presented Dennett Sullins objected idea computer technology capacity make human being moral agent mental state intentionality common sense emotion Johnson Kuflik
They instance point make sense treat computer system moral agent held responsible suffer thus punished Sparrow Asaro
Or argue Stahl computer capable moral reasoning capacity understand meaning information process
In order comprehend meaning moral statement agent part form life statement meaningful able take part moral discourse
Similar debate AI critic continue draw distinction human computer noting various capacity computer would justify attribution moral agency
In absence definitive argument possibility future computer system morally responsible researcher within field machine ethic aim develop discussion focusing instead creating computer system behave moral agent Moor
Research within field concerned design development computer system independently determine right thing would given situation
According Allen Wallach AMAs would capable reasoning moral social significance behavior use assessment effect behavior sentient being make appropriate choice see also Wallach Allen Allen et al

Such ability needed argue computer becoming complex capable operating without direct human control different context environment
Progressively autonomous technology already development military robot driverless car train service robot home healthcare involved moral situation directly affect safety human
An autonomous bomb disposal robot might future faced decision bomb defuse first order minimize casualty
Similarly moral decision driverless car might make whether break crossing dog avoid risk causing injury driver behind
Such decision require judgment
Currently operator make moral decision decision already inscribed design computer system
Machine ethic Wallach Allen argue go one step beyond making engineer aware value build design product seek build ethical machine
To specify mean computer make ethical decision put ethic machine Moor distinguishes three different kind ethical agent implicit ethical agent explicit ethical agent full ethical agent
The first kind agent computer ethic developer inscribed design
These agent constructed adhere norm value context developed used
Thus ATM teller designed high level security prevent unauthorized people drawing money account
An explicit ethical agent computer ethic
In word basis ethical model determine would right thing given certain input
The ethical model based traditional ethical theory Kantian utilitarian preference creator
These agent would make ethical decision behalf human user developer
Such agent akin autonomous moral agent described Allen Wallach
Finally Moor defines full ethical agent entity make ethical judgment justify much like human being
He claim although computer technology today called fully ethical empirical question whether would possible future
The effort build AMAs raise question effort affect ascription moral responsibility
If technology moral agent like human being held morally responsible
As human being would design artificial agent behave within formalized ethical framework likely responsibility still ascribed human actor deploy technology
However Allen Wallach acknowledge danger exclusively focusing equipping robot moral ability rather also looking sociotechnical system robot embedded may cause confusion distribution responsibility
Robots moral capability may present similar challenge ascribing responsibility technology introduce new complexity obfuscate chain accountability lead back creator user
The prospect increasingly autonomous intelligent computer technology growing difficulty finding responsible human agent lead Floridi Sanders take different approach
They propose extend class moral agent include artificial agent disconnecting moral agency moral accountability notion moral responsibility
They contend insurmountable difficulty traditional rather outdated view human found accountable certain kind software even hardware demand different approach
Instead suggest artificial agent acknowledged moral agent held accountable responsible
To illustrate draw comparison artificial agent dog source moral action
Dogs cause morally charged action like damaging property helping save person life case dog
We identify moral agent even though generally hold morally responsible according Floridi Sanders source moral action held morally accountable correcting punishing
Just like animal Floridi Sanders argue artificial agent seen source moral action thus held morally accountable conceived behaving like moral agent appropriate
The notion level abstraction refers stance one adopts towards entity predict explain behavior
At low level abstraction would explain behavior system term mechanical biological process
At higher level abstraction help describe behavior system term belief desire thought
If high enough level computational system effectively described interactive autonomous adaptive held accountable according Floridi Sanders
It thus require personhood free agent morally accountable rather agent act intention able make choice
The advantage disconnecting accountability responsibility according Floridi Sanders place focus moral agenthood accountability censure instead figuring human agent responsible
We le likely assign responsibility cost forced necessity identify human moral agent
We liberate technological development AAs Artificial Agents bound standard limiting view
When artificial agent behave badly dealt directly autonomous behavior complexity make difficult distribute responsibility among human agent
Immoral agent modified deleted
It possible attribute moral accountability even moral responsibility determined
Critics Floridi Sanders view accountability moral agency argue placing focus analysis computational artifact treating moral agent draw attention away human deploy develop
Johnson instance make case computer technology remain connected intentionality creator user
She argues although computational artifact part moral world recognized entity moral relevance moral agent intentional
They mental state purpose come freedom act
She emphasizes artifact intentionality intentionality related functionality
They artifact design use reflect intention designer user
Human user turn use intentionality interact software
In interacting artifact activate inscribed intention designer developer
It human activity computer technology designed developed tested installed initiated provided input instruction perform specified task
Without human activity computer would nothing
Attributing independent moral agency computer Johnson claim disconnect human behavior creates deploys us
It turn attention away force shape technological development limit possibility intervention
For instance leaf issue sorting responsible dealing malfunctioning immoral artificial agent make amends harmful event may cause
It postpones question account condition artificial agent allowed operate Noorman
Yet say technology moral agent say part moral action
Several philosopher stressed moral responsibility properly understood without recognizing active role technology shaping human action Jonas Verbeek Johnson Powers Waelbers
Johnson instance claim although computer moral agent artifact designer artifact artifact user focus moral evaluation work action Johnson
Humans create artifact inscribe particular value intention achieve particular effect world turn technological artifact influence human being affect perceive interpret world
Similarly Verbeek maintains technological artifact alone moral agency building work Bruno Latour argues moral agency hardly ever purely human
Moral agency generally involves mediating artifact shape human behavior often way anticipated designer
Moral decision action technological artifact
He suggests form human action three form agency work agency human performing action agency designer helped shaped mediating role artifact artifact mediating human action
The agency artifact inextricably linked agency designer user reduced either
For subject act make moral decision composite human technological component
Moral agency merely located human complex blend human technology
In light noted difficulty ascribing moral responsibility several author critiqued way concept used interpreted relation computing
They claim traditional model framework dealing moral responsibility fall short propose different perspective interpretation address difficulty
One approach rethink moral responsibility assigned Gotterbarn Waelbers
When come computing practitioner Gotterbarn observes tendency avoid responsibility looking someone else blame
He attribute tendency two pervasive misconception responsibility
The first misconception computing ethically neutral practice
According Gotterbarn misplaced belief technological artifact practice building ethically neutral often used justify narrow focus development computer system without taking broader context technology operate account
This narrow focus detrimental consequence
Gotterbarn give example programmer given assignment write program could lower raise device pole technician set required height
The programmer focused solving given puzzle failed take account circumstance device would used contingency might occur
He thus consider possibility patient could accidentally way device moving pole
This oversight eventually resulted tragic accident
A patient crushed device technician set device tabletop height realizing patient still underneath
According Gotterbarn computer practitioner moral responsibility consider contingency even though may legally required
The design use technological artifact moral activity choice one particular design solution another real material consequence
The second misconception responsibility determining blame something go wrong
Computer practitioner according Gotterbarn conventionally adopted malpractice model responsibility focus determining appropriate person blame harmful incident
This malpractice model lead sort excuse shirk responsibility
In particular complexity computer technology introduce allow computer practitioner responsibility
The distance developer effect use technology create instance used claim direct immediate causal link would tie developer malfunction
Developers argue contribution chain event negligible part team larger organization limited opportunity otherwise
The malpractice model according Gotterbarn entices computer practitioner distance accountability blame
The two misconception based particular view responsibility place focus exempts one blame liability
In reference Ladd Gotterbarn call negative responsibility distinguishes positive responsibility see also Ladd
Positive responsibility emphasizes virtue obliged regard consequence action others Gotterbarn
Positive responsibility entail part professionalism computer expert strive minimize foreseeable undesirable event
It focus ought done rather blaming punishing others irresponsible behavior
Gotterbarn argues computing profession adopt positive concept responsibility emphasizes obligation duty computer practitioner regard consequence one action minimize possibility causing harm
Computer practitioner moral responsibility avoid harm deliver properly working product according regardless whether held accountable thing turn differently
The emphasis prospective moral responsibility computer practitioner raise question far responsibility reach particular light system many hand help create difficulty involved anticipating contingency might cause system malfunction Stieb Miller
To extent developer manufacturer expected exert anticipate prevent consequence use technology possible bug code
These system generally incomprehensible single programmer seems unlikely complex computer system completely error free
Moreover designer engineer foresee possible condition product eventually operate
Should manufacturer mobile phone anticipated product would used roadside bomb
A fundamental question whether computer programmer broader responsibility welfare public primarily responsible performing task well
Nevertheless distinction positive negative responsibility underline holding someone morally responsible function provides yet another perspective issue Stahl
Both prospectively retrospectively responsibility work organize social relation people people institution
It set expectation people fulfillment certain obligation duty provides mean correct encourage certain behavior
For instance robotics company expected build safeguard prevent robot harming human
If company fails live expectation held accountable case pay damage undergo kind punishment
The punishment prospect punishment encourage company regard system safety reliability sound design risk involved production robot
It might trigger company take action prevent future accident
Yet might also encourage find way shift blame
The particular practice social structure place ascribe responsibility hold people accountable influence relate technology
Nissenbaum contends difficulty attributing moral responsibility large extent traced back particular characteristic organizational cultural context computer technology embedded
She argues conceive nature capacity limitation computing influence answerability develop use computer technology
She observes systematic erosion accountability increasingly computerized society conceives accountability value practice place emphasis preventing harm risk
Accountability mean someone several people answer malfunction system cause risk grave injury cause infrastructure large monetary loss even malfunction cause individual loss time convenience contentment
It used powerful tool motivating better practice consequently reliable trustworthy system
Holding people accountable harm risk caused computer system provides strong incentive minimize provide starting point assigning punishment
Current cultural organizational practice however opposite due condition computer technology commonly developed deployed coupled popular conception nature capacity limitation computing
Nissenbaum identifies four barrier accountability today society problem many hand acceptance computer bug inherent element large software system using computer scapegoat ownership without liability
According Nissenbaum people tendency shirk responsibility shift blame others accident occur
The problem many hand idea software bug inevitable complex computer system easily accepted excuse answering harmful outcome
People also inclined point finger complexity computer argue computer fault thing go wrong
Finally perceives tendency company claim ownership software develop dismiss responsibility come ownership
Current day computer program come extended license agreement assert manufacturer ownership software disclaim accountability quality performance product
They also dismiss liability consequential damage resulting defect software
These four barrier Nissenbaum hold stand way culture accountability aimed maintaining clear line accountability
Such culture foster strong sense responsibility virtue encouraged everyone connected outcome particular action answerable
Accountability according Nissenbaum different liability
Liability looking person blame compensate damage suffered event
Once person found others let hook may encourage people look excuse blaming computer
Accountability however applies involved
It requires particular kind organizational context one answerability work entice people pay greater attention system safety reliability sound design order establish culture accountability
An organization place le value accountability little regard responsibility organizing production process likely allow technological product become incomprehensible
Nissenbaum analysis illustrates context technology developed used significant influence ascription moral responsibility several author stressed moral responsibility properly understood without recognizing active role technology shaping human action Jonas Verbeek Johnson Powers Waelbers
According Johnson Powers enough look human intend
Ascribing responsibility person act technology requires coming grip behavior technology
One consider various way technological artifact mediate human action
Moral responsibility thus action person group people affect others morally significant way also action shaped technology

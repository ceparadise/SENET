A set test input execution condition expected result developed particular objective exercise particular program path verify compliance specific requirement
A test case could simply question ask program
The point running test gain information example whether program pas fail test
Test case cornerstone developed verify quality behavior product
In order fully test requirement application met must least two test case requirement one positive test one negative test
If requirement must least two test case
Keeping track link requirement test frequently done using
Written test case include description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted
A formal written characterized known input expected output worked test executed
The known input test expected output test
For application system without formal requirement test case written based accepted normal operation program similar class
In school testing test case written activity result reported test run
In hypothetical story used help tester think complex problem system
These scenario usually written detail
They simple diagram testing environment could description written prose
The ideal scenario test story motivating credible complex easy evaluate
They usually different test case test case single step scenario cover number step key
A test case usually single step occasionally sequence step test correct feature application
An expected result expected outcome usually given
Additional information may included Larger test case may also contain prerequisite state step description
A written test case also contain place actual result
These step stored word processor document spreadsheet database common repository
In database system may also able see past test result generated result system configuration used generate result
These past result would usually stored separate table
often also contain Besides description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted time consuming part test case creating test modifying system change
Under special circumstance could need run test produce result team expert would evaluate result considered pas
This happens often new product performance number determination
The first test taken base line subsequent test product release cycle
use variation written test case commonly performed group client system ensure developed system meet requirement specified contract
User acceptance test differentiated inclusion positive test case almost complete exclusion negative test case

Testing important critical part software development process quality reliability delivered product strictly depend
Testing limited detection bug
software also increase level proper functioning evaluation functional nonfunctional property
In compiling survey tried study fascinating topic
The approach overviewed include traditional technique structural criterion well modern one specification based technique
However test practice inherently still remains methodology
We never find test approach guaranteed deliver perfect
product
So carry research area specification based testing
In view fact research want carry research generate test case specification software made using mathematical formal specification technique
In addition measurement completeness effectiveness test case also important issue help increasing confidence software engineer product delivered
Testing effectiveness determined one testing way thing produce result
Defect data obvious testing artifact measure must put context coupled key factor critical enabling improvement
For black box testing input variable schema would relate input implementation test output variable would relate observable result test

If Automation excluded manual testing point view diffrerence Test Strategy Test Scenario Test case Test Script A Test Strategy document high level document normally developed project manager
This document defines Testing achieve testing objective
The Test Strategy normally derived Business Requirement Specification document
Some company include inside Test Plan fine usually case small project
However larger project one Test Strategy document different number Test Plans phase level testing
Components Test Strategy document Scope Objectives Business issue Roles responsibility Communication status reporting Test deliverability Industry standard follow Test automation tool Testing measurement metrices Risks mitigation Defect reporting tracking Change configuration management Training plan A scenario story describes hypothetical situation
In testing check program cope hypothetical situation
The ideal scenario test credible motivating easy evaluate complex
Scenarios usually different test case test case single step scenario cover number step
Test suite scenario used concert complete system test
A Scenario functionality tested
It also called Test Condition Test Possibility
In software engineering test case set condition variable tester determine requirement upon application partially fully satisfied
It may take many test case determine requirement fully satisfied
In order fully test requirement application met must least one test case requirement unless requirement sub requirement
In situation sub requirement must least one test case
A test case also defined sequence step test correct behavior application
A sequence step consisting action performed system test
These step sometimes called test procedure test script
These action often associated set data preloaded input test
The combination action taken data provided system test lead test condition
This condition tends produce result test compare expected result ass quality given test condition
The action performed serially parallel combination consecution
Test Script set instruction written using language performed system test verify system performs expected
Test script used automated testing
Sometimes set instruction written human language used manual testing also called Test Script better term would Test Case
Test Scenario mean What tested test case mean How tested
Test case It consist test case name Precondition step input condition expected result
Test Scenario Test scenario consists detailed test procedure
We also say test scenario many test case associated
Before executing test scenario need think test case scenario
Test Script A Test Script set instruction written using programming language performed system test verify system performs expected
Test script term used referring automated testing
When creating test script using automation tool create script
outline testing approach everything else surround
It different test plan sense Test strategy sub set test plan
It hard core test document extent generic static
There also argument level test strategy plan I really see discerning difference
Example Test plan give information going test time
For example Module going tested
If tester Y replaces X reason test plan updated
On contrary test strategy going detail like module tested test team member
In case matter testing generic change team member updated keeping static
This one line pointer tester create initial transitional step test design phase
This mostly one line definition going test respect certain feature
Usually test scenario input creation test case
In agile project Test scenario test design output test case written following
A test scenario might result multiple test
Examples test scenario Test Case commonly used term specific test
This usually smallest unit testing
A Test Case consist information requirement testing test step verification step prerequisite output test environment etc
A set input execution precondition expected outcome developed particular objective exercise particular program path verify compliance specific requirement
Commonly used refer instruction particular test carried automated test tool By posting answer agree

Hey someone tell difference test design test case specification
I use IEEE Test Case Specification Template I sure I write step testing Thanx detailing test condition expected result well test pas criterion specifying test data use running test condition identified Test Design Specification In IEEE numbered Test Design Specification section defines feature set tested general criterion determine test case
It also must list id test case specification implement test requirement
There many many TDS section test plan
For example would one TDS use case alternate flow tested
Each numbered Test Case Specification defines exact setup input one test case
So typically many TCS TDS
As practical matter expected result typically required test case instead general criterion
Putting criterion TDS usually done support manual testing allowing tester make subjective evaluation using general knowledge
This support complete hierarchy feature set test test case
It work equally well manual automated testing unit integration system scope

A test case document set test data precondition expected result postconditions developed particular test scenario order verify compliance specific requirement
Test Case act starting point test execution applying set input value application definitive outcome leaf system end point also known execution postcondition
Test Case ID Test Scenario Test Case Description Test Steps Prerequisite Test Data Expected Result Test Parameters Actual Result Environment Information Comments Let u say need check input field accept maximum character
While developing test case scenario test case documented following way
In example first case pas scenario second case FAIL
If expected result match actual result log defect
The defect go defect life cycle tester address fix

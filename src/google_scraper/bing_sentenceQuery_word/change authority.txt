Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information

French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research

During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Miles Berry Chris Leach Cast mind back January
In one many overhaul education secretary announced attention scrap ICT curriculum favour computing
The idea behind
To revive legacy wartime hero Alan Turing create generation young people able work forefront technological change
school preparing implement curriculum change September
And like Facebook Google welcomed move want know teaching community think
Miles Berry subject leader computing education share argument favour change
On opposing side Chris Leach head ICT argues favour keeping ICT
If like add opinion debate please feel free comment article
It hard deny massive change computing née ICT new national curriculum
The name change much content introduction computer science much programming far greater emphasis giving pupil knowledge understanding computation digital technology
While none prohibited former curriculum I delighted form part entitlement local authority school curriculum benchmark others
In report Royal Society made case rebranding ICT computing partly damage done perception subject undemanding public exam
Computing umbrella term subject whole comprises three element computer science information technology digital literacy
It helpful think foundation application implication digital technology
While teacher might cover aspect independently much gained drawing three
The new focus computer science CS provides ample justification computing place timetable
In CS rigorous academic discipline
Like science provides unique lens pupil understand world
Given role digital technology rounded liberal education include alongside history poetry music
Studying CS develop pupil ability think like computer scientist
Pupils gain portfolio mental tool labelled thinking including ability look abstraction algorithmic solution pattern way decomposing problem well desire find efficient elegant solution
These skill rarely taught elsewhere curriculum
The insight Logo work learn best making thing others underpins much new curriculum particularly coding element
While always bit programming national curriculum tended marginalised many school
We mean opportunity provide rich varied diet programming experience stage education Bee Bots
It going exciting see pupil coding skill go developer computer scientist future technically literate politician entrepreneur manager bode well u
The significant change however switch focus skill understanding
Education ought concerned developing understanding idea principle rather training people use particular software
As part education rather learning search Google child also learn Google put result order keep track query type
Many digital native capable acquiring tech skill still critical role teacher developing knowledge understanding underpin new computing curriculum seek
What ICT
Here I define subject pupil I remind ICT stand information communication technology subject use technology communicate information
I often find telling child ICT computing
So changing name subject ICT computing limiting subject narrowing curriculum
Computer science feature highly ICT curriculum I gradually increased amount computer science ICT curriculum independently national curriculum
Of course child need know technology work use effectively
I want pupil user technology creator well I excited possibility device bring
But I also want child I teach understand social historical aspect ICT
With ICT child look issue regarding use ICT real world recent news report safe responsible use ICT key component curriculum
Children look technology changed communicate affected society around world
They consider different form communication development telegraph
We look history computer early mechanical calculator
I want child understand technology developed appreciation visionary made possible
By understanding ICT evolved I hope child able contemplate continue evolve better prepared adapt alongside
One reason change subject name confusion ICT actually
Is tool learning subject subject right
I would argue
ICT used every subject done effectively subject becomes much covered separate ICT lesson
Some school may decided could cover ICT using across curriculum led rebrand subject becomes focus school

Freelance Writer Think thing every day posting status update downloading song checking class schedule online Do think would cool design technology make device work better
To invent new one
To help make people life job easier
Then maybe right path
But first let set thing straight
Computer scientist people call printer stop working
And sit dark cubicle day without talking anyone
Whatever think computer science wrong say Dianna Xu Chair Computer Science Department Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania
So
Computer scientist use technology solve problem
They write software make computer new thing accomplish task efficiently
They create application mobile device develop website program software
And find everywhere big tech firm government agency startup nonprofit
It everyday computing say Liz Burd Chancellor Learning Teaching University Newcastle Australia
It building tool enable everyday One biggest thing computer science major learn logically think problem find way solve
Chris Stephenson Executive Director Computer Science Teachers Association add good computer scientist also understand teamwork good communicator
They work people time say including come CS background
No matter brilliant point explain someone product work code Stephenson say
Bobby Schnabel Dean School Informatics Computing chair Association Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee say student go computer science like working computer
Others want solve problem technology

These day I lot programming Anokwa say
Those skill head
All skill I need I learned first couple year Brown meant study philosophy enrolled Lexington Virginia
But also liked tinkering computer
He took class logic class computer programming
It might seem like two subject anything common Brown liked relied logical thinking
It seems like straightforward correlation say
The summer graduating computer science degree went back hometown Memphis Tennessee got job lifeguarding country club
Through someone met found next job helped company find new employee department
Outside work joined informal group programmer
That met founder website called MyRepresentatives
The site make easy people live Memphis area find represents local state federal government
Brown started working site lead developer
It unpaid valuable position
He working MyRepresentatives month landed paid job Lindsey Software company design program public housing agency work today
The computer programming class Lynch took high school one favorite
I liked knowing logic understanding thing work say
How work solve problem She majored computer science Colchester Vermont learned little bit everything computing programming language mathematical principle behind technology managing website attack problem system
The biggest thing degree gave perfect foundation build career Lynch say
In experience general degree
A technical degree general Now technical analyst Esri software company us sophisticated mapping technology called geographic information system GIS
Lynch even know GIS joined Esri imagine working industry
Among thing company software used map damage Hurricane Sandy left East Coast illustrate federal government sent money different project
Lynch design application company use Esri software
In job help customer work colleague develop test application
She like different thing every day
Every month something change I get cutting edge happening field say
Umali might playing day since company Turbine develops world popular online game sometimes need play make sure everything work correctly
Turbine make game like Dungeons Dragons The Lord Rings
Umali work behind scene keep game running smoothly making sure user sign want play list top player date
It energetic dynamic environment say
Umali graduated computer science degree Troy New York
Since several job software industry managing data people access need
Technology changed lot since college Umali say computer science major taught timeless skill like examine process information
They taught u principle break problem manageable piece say
Then prepared learn innovation field like new programming language

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

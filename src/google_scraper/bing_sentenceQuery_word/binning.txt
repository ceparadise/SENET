Binning process combining charge adjacent pixel CCD readout
This process performed prior digitization circuitry CCD specialized control serial parallel register
The two primary benefit binning improved SNR ability increase albeit expense reduced spatial resolution
To understand process consider example binning shown
As normal operation charge integrates individual pixel CCD exposed light
During parallel readout charge two row pixel rather single row shifted serial register
Next charge shifted serial register two pixel time summing well
It go output amplifier converted voltage transferred amplification digitization
This procedure iterated entire array read
The result readout event summing well contains collected charge four pixel CCD
It noted Photometrics camera ability perform binning arbitrary MxN binned pixel superpixels simple software control
Since serial register summing well accumulate charge multiple pixel binning must sufficient capacity prevent
In CCDs serial register typically charge capacity double parallel register summing well double serial register
However specification particular CCD used noted understood using binning technique
This especially true working level saturation could lead erroneous data collection
The primary benefit binning higher SNR due reduced read noise contribution
CCD read noise added readout event normal operation read noise added pixel
However binning mode read noise added superpixel combined signal multiple pixel
In ideal case produce SNR improvement equal binning factor example
The figure show effect binning region
This example assumes photoelectron collected pixel read noise electron
If region read normal mode SNR signal lost noise
However binning SNR becomes sufficient observe weak signal
Unlike read noise reduced binning since pixel contribute dark current noise superpixel
To ensure dark current noise lower SNR binning essential CCD cooled sufficiently reduce dark current noise negligible level relative read noise
One common application binning spectroscopy
In spectroscopic CCD system dispersed slit image lie along CCD column perpendicular serial register resultant image binned along column
Binning thus provides marked increase SNR without loss spectral resolution
Spatial resolution lost along slit axis typically concern
Another use binning increase frame rate
Since slowest step readout sequence digitization given pixel binning used increase effective total frame rate given system
Thus highly binned image obtained high speed required focusing image obtained ultimate resolution required
Because controlled via software Photometrics digital camera extremely flexible used wide variety analytical imaging application

What binning mean
CCD versatile device readout pattern manipulated achieve various effect
One common effect Binning
Binning allows charge adjacent pixel combined offer benefit faster readout speed improved signal noise ratio albeit expense reduced spatial resolution
To understand process let u compare process single pixel readout versus x binning shown
If consider spot light evenly illuminates four pixel miniature CCD
The CCD light sensitive region four pixel readout register depicted blue bottom CCD
The light signal induces charge electron four pixel shown shading number bottom right hand corner pixel
light fall evenly four pixel creates charge four pixel
first operation shift charge one row
The charge lowest pixel get shifted readout register
single pixel readout charge readout register shifted right readout amplifier
In binning operation charge shifted charge first row added first row readout register
single pixel readout first pixel readout readout register shifted shift charge second pixel readout amplifier
In binning operation summed charge two right two pixel shifted readout amplifier
single pixel readout next row shifted vertically readout register
In binning operation readout register shifted sum charge pixel readout amplifier readout
single pixel readout mode readout register shifted right readout next pixel
Binned operation complete
single pixel readout readout register shifted right readout final pixel
It important highlight main difference two readout scheme
In first achieve full spatial resolution sensor offer
In Binned example reduced pixel pattern single pixel hence lost spatial resolution
However binned operation take le step readout sensor hence faster
Typically binning twice fast achieved shift readout register every vertical shift
If binning CCD readout would respectively time faster
The binned example also highlight binning improves signal noise ratio
If assume CCD readout noise
Then single pixel example pixel readout noise hence achieve signal noise ratio
Even subsequently sum four pixel computer readout signal noise ratio becomes
In adding four pixel sum signal time
noise added quadrature
square root sum noise squared square root time squared

In binned example noise signal readout amplifier signal noise ratio
twice good single pixel readout mode
One common application binning spectroscopy
In spectroscopic CCD system spectral line typically image slit formed
The image slit typically high aspect ratio
long thin orientated perpendicular readout register
The signal single spectral line binned achieve best signal noise ratio without deterioration spectral resolution

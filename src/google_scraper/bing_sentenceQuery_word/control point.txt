In order individual imperative evaluated
The emphasis explicit control flow distinguishes language language
Within imperative statement execution result choice made two path follow
For functional language function language construct exist achieve result usually termed control flow statement
A set statement turn generally structured addition grouping also defines
mechanism alter flow control way similar subroutine usually occur response external stimulus event occur rather execution control flow statement
At level control flow instruction usually work altering
For CPUs control flow instruction available conditional unconditional instruction also termed jump
The kind control flow statement supported different language vary categorized effect A explicit name number assigned fixed position within may referenced control flow statement appearing elsewhere source code
A label mark position within source code effect
alternative named label used language placed start line text source code
Languages use often impose constraint line number must increase value following line may require consecutive
For example BASIC In language label usually appearing start line immediately followed colon
For example C The language allowed whole number identifier label linked colon following statement variant allowed whole number
The statement combination English word pronounced accordingly basic form unconditional transfer control
Although may either upper lower case depending language usually written The effect goto statement cause next statement executed statement appearing immediately indicated label
Goto statement many computer scientist notably
The terminology varies may alternatively known routine procedure function especially return result method especially belong
In computer memory small current standard subroutine used mainly reduce program size
A piece code written used many time various place program
Today subroutine often used help make program structured isolating algorithm hiding data access method
If many programmer working one program subroutine one kind help divide work
In structured programming ordered sequencing successive command considered one basic control structure used building block program alongside iteration recursion choice
In May Böhm Jacopini published article showed program could transformed form involving choice IF THEN ELSE loop WHILE condition DO xxx possibly duplicated code addition Boolean variable flag
Later author showed choice replaced loop yet Boolean variable
That minimalism possible mean necessarily desirable computer theoretically need subtract one number another branch result negative practical computer dozen even hundred machine instruction
What Böhm Jacopini article showed program could
Other research showed control structure one entry one exit much easier understand form mainly could used anywhere statement without disrupting control flow
In word
Later development recently composable continued strategy making component program even freely composable
Some academic took purist approach result argued even instruction like middle loop bad practice needed proof thus advocated loop single exit point
This purist approach embodied language designed preferred tool teaching introductory programming academia
The direct application theorem may result additional local variable introduced structured chart may also result
The latter issue called context
Pascal affected problem according empirical study cited student programmer difficulty formulating correct solution Pascal several simple problem including writing function searching element array
A study Henry Shapiro cited Roberts found using control structure correct solution given subject subject wrote incorrect code problem allowed write return middle loop
Most programming language control structure initial keyword indicates type control structure involved
Languages divide whether control structure final keyword
Conditional expression conditional construct feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Less common variation include compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action else otherwise taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
Case logic also implemented functional form statement
A loop sequence statement specified may carried several time succession
The code inside loop loop shown obeyed specified number time collection item condition met
In language loop expressed using rather explicit looping construct
special case recursion easily transformed iteration
Most programming language construction repeating loop certain number time
In case counting go downwards instead upwards step size used
In example N body loop may execute I value depending programming language
In many programming language integer reliably used loop
number represented imprecisely due hardware constraint loop might repeated time depending rounding error hardware compiler version
Furthermore increment X occurs repeated addition accumulated rounding error may mean value X iteration differ quite significantly expected sequence
Most programming language construction repeating loop condition change
Some variation test condition start loop others test end
If test start body may skipped completely end body always executed least
A value change detection method used within ordinary loop trigger processing group value
Values monitored within loop change diverts program flow handling group event associated
Several programming language later special construct allow implicit looping element array member set collection
generalise loop also support us
comprehension together provide similar function Scala
General iteration construct C statement form used express sort loop others looping number collection parallel
Where specific looping construct used usually preferred general iteration construct since often make purpose expression clearer
used assure program segment loop forever exceptional condition arises error
For instance program loop forever handling event occur stopping process terminated operator
Infinite loop implemented using control flow construct
Most commonly unstructured programming jump back goto structured programming indefinite loop loop set never end either omitting condition explicitly setting true
Some language special construct infinite loop typically omitting condition indefinite loop
Examples include Ada Fortran Go Ruby
Often infinite loop unintentionally created programming error loop wherein loop condition us variable never change within loop
Sometimes within body loop desire skip remainder loop body continue next iteration loop
Some language provide statement language Perl Ruby
The effect prematurely terminate innermost loop body resume normal next iteration
If iteration last one loop effect terminate entire loop early
Some language like Perl Ruby statement restarts current iteration start
Ruby statement restarts entire loop initial iteration
When using loop search table might desirable stop searching soon required item found
Some programming language provide statement language Perl effect terminate current loop immediately transfer control statement immediately loop
The following example done support
Both feature similar comparing code snippet show difference must combined statement construct
support conditional execution code depending whether loop exited early statement using loop
For example The clause example linked statement inner statement
Both Python loop support else clause executed early exit loop occurred
Some language support breaking nested loop theory circle called break
One common use example searching table
This done either via multilevel break break level bash PHP via labeled break break continue given label Java Perl
Alternatives multilevel break include single break together state variable tested break another level exception caught level broken placing nested loop function using return effect termination entire nested loop using label goto statement
C include multilevel break usual alternative use goto implement labeled break
Python multilevel break continue proposed rejected basis added complexity worth rare legitimate use
The notion break interest give rise today called
In refined proving possible avoid adding additional variable structured programming long break loop allowed
Furthermore Kosaraju proved strict hierarchy program exists every integer exists program containing break depth rewritten program break depth le without introducing added variable
One also subroutine executing looped statement breaking nested loop subroutine
There multiple break generally implemented exception instead
In textbook us Tennent notion explain similarity break return statement
Watt note class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
As commonly implemented however return sequencer may also carry return value whereas break sequencer implemented contemporary language usually
used express correctness loop
In practical term loop variant integer expression initial value
The variant value must decrease loop iteration must never become negative correct execution loop
Loop variant used guarantee loop terminate
A loop invariant assertion must true first loop iteration remain true iteration
This implies loop terminates correctly exit condition loop invariant satisfied
Loop invariant used monitor specific property loop successive iteration
Some programming language contain native support loop variant invariant
In case support specification
Some dialect provide extensive sublanguage describing Loops
An early example found Conversional Lisp
provides Loop macro implement sublanguage
Many programming language especially favoring dynamic style programming offer construct
These cause flow execution jump given context resume predeclared point
three common sort control construct exotic one also exist keyword
standard condition ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE raised intercepted ON action Programmers also define use named condition
Like one statement specified many case GOTO needed decide flow control resume
Unfortunately implementation substantial overhead space time especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE many programmer tried avoid using condition
Common Syntax example Modern language specialized structured construct exception handling rely use break return
For example one write Any number variety clause used
If matching particular control percolate back subroutine call nested block matching found end main program reached point program forcibly stopped suitable error message
Via influence keyword reserved declaring exception handler language popular today like Java C
Some language like Ada use keyword introduce exception handler may even employ different keyword Ada pattern matching
A language like incorporate placeholder exception handler syntax automatically extract several piece information exception occurs
This approach exemplified construct AppleScript David Watt textbook also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article section early exit loop
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
Watt note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding explicit code ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
In Object Pascal D Java C Python clause added construct
No matter control leaf code inside clause guaranteed execute
This useful writing code must relinquish expensive resource opened file database connection finished processing Since pattern fairly common C special syntax Upon leaving compiler guarantee object released effectively variable file stream abstracting side effect initializing releasing file
Python statement Ruby block argument used similar effect
All language mentioned define standard exception circumstance thrown
Users throw exception fact allows user throw catch almost type including basic type like whereas language like Java permissive
C introduced async keyword supporting direct style
also known semicoroutines allow control yielded consumer method temporarily typically using keyword
Like async keyword support programming direct style
function yield control form without thread
Coroutines implemented library programming language provides either continuation generator distinction coroutines generator practice technical detail
In spoof article Lawrence Clark suggested GOTO statement could replaced statement provides entertaining example
COMEFROM implemented one named
article Structured Programming go Statements identifies two situation covered control structure listed gave example control structure could handle situation
Despite utility construct yet found way mainstream programming language
The following proposed If omitted get loop test top
If omitted get loop test bottom
If omitted get infinite loop
Hence single construction replace several construction programming language
A possible variant allow one test within loop use see next section appears cover case better
Languages lacking construct generally emulate using equivalent idiom In loop construct represented using standard infinite loop clause middle confused statement following section
Naming loop like example optional permit leaving outer loop several nested loop
This proposed
A modified version presented
used specify event may occur within occurrence indicated using name event statement
When event occur relevant action carried control pass
This construction provides clear separation determining situation applies action taken situation
conceptually similar exception similar construct used purpose many language
The following simple example involves searching table particular item
One way attack piece software redirect flow execution program
A variety technique including shadow stack pointer verification used defend attack

learn share knowledge build career
One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

I ca understand fixed point floating point number due hard read definition Google
But none I read provide simple enough explanation really
Can I get plain definition example
A fixed point number specific number bit digit reserved integer part part left decimal point specific number bit reserved fractional part part right decimal point
No matter large small number always use number bit portion
For example fixed point format decimal largest number could represent would smallest would
Every bit code process number knowledge decimal point
A floating point number reserve specific number bit integer part fractional part
Instead reserve certain number bit number called certain number bit say within number decimal place sits called
So floating point number took digit digit reserved exponent might represent largest value smallest value
A fixed point number mean fixed number digit decimal point
A floating point number allows varying number digit decimal point
For example way storing number requires exactly four digit decimal point fixed point
Without restriction floating point
Often fixed point used programmer actually us integer make assumption digit beyond decimal point
For example I might want keep two digit precision value mean actually mean mean mean etc
Floating point number general purpose represent small large number way small penalty extra storage decimal place go
The term refers corresponding manner number represented fixed number digit sometimes decimal point
With representation placement decimal point relative significant digit number
For example representation uniform decimal point placement convention represent number etc whereas representation could addition represent etc
From understanding arithmetic done using integer
decimal part stored fixed amount bit number multiplied many digit decimal precision needed
For example If number need stored need two digit precision decimal point number multiplied get
When performing math number use rule set
Adding number would yield data
If want calculate decimal part number use modulo operand
pseudocode Floating point number completely different story programming
The current standard floating point number use something like bit data number bit exponent sign
Take number Floating point let represent every number great deal precision
Fixed le precise simpler By posting answer agree

In object whose value refers another value stored elsewhere using
A pointer location memory obtaining value stored location known pointer
As analogy page number book index could considered pointer corresponding page dereferencing pointer would done flipping page given page number reading text found indexed page
Pointers data significantly improve performance repetitive operation traversing structure
In particular often much cheaper time space copy dereference pointer copy access data pointer point
Pointers also used hold address entry point subroutine
In used often using called
A pointer simple concrete implementation abstract
Several language support type pointer although restriction use others
While pointer used refer reference general properly applies whose explicitly allows pointer manipulated arithmetically via memory address opposed possible
Because pointer allow protected unprotected access memory address risk associated using particularly latter case
Primitive pointer often stored format similar however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To alleviate potential problem matter pointer considered separate type parameterized type data point even underlying representation integer
Other measure may also taken validation bound checking verify content pointer variable contain value valid memory address within numerical range processor capable addressing
credited invention pointer
In Lawson presented Computer Pioneer Award f inventing pointer variable introducing concept thus providing first time capability flexibly treat linked list high level language
According first appeared print technical memorandum
In pointer kind
A datum read written using one memory access instance primitive
A group primitive contiguous memory viewed collectively one datum instance aggregate could logically contiguous byte value represent coordinate point space
When aggregate entirely composed type primitive aggregate may called sense primitive array byte program use word way
In context definition smallest primitive specifies different byte
The memory address initial byte datum considered memory address entire datum
A primitive value intended used memory address said
It also said pointer value datum memory address
More generally pointer kind said obtain datum
The feature separate pointer kind reference pointer value meant interpreted memory address rather concept
References serve level indirection A pointer value determines memory address datum used calculation
Because indirection fundamental aspect algorithm pointer often expressed fundamental typed programming language pointer determines type datum pointer point
When setting like tree necessary pointer help manage structure implemented controlled
Typical example pointer start pointer end pointer pointer
These pointer either actual absolute start address base typically us fewer bit full address usually require one additional arithmetic operation resolve
Relative address form manual share many advantage disadvantage
A offset containing unsigned integer used provide relative addressing kilobyte data structure
This easily extended address pointed forced word boundary requiring additional shift left order adjust offset factor addition base address
Generally though scheme lot trouble convenience programmer absolute address underlying preferred
A one byte offset hexadecimal value character
used point alternative integer value index array

In way character efficiently translated usable sequential absolute address without
used control usually make extensive use pointer
The pointer usually embedded table entry may instance used hold entry point executed based certain condition defined table entry
The pointer however simply index separate associated table comprising array actual address address depending upon programming language construct available
They also used point earlier table entry loop processing forward skip table entry early exit loop
For latter purpose pointer may simply table entry number transformed actual address simple arithmetic
Pointers thin top addressing capability provided modern
In simplest scheme numeric assigned unit memory system unit typically either depending whether architecture effectively transforming memory large
The system would also provide operation retrieve value stored memory unit given address usually utilizing machine
In usual case pointer large enough hold address unit memory system
This introduces possibility program may attempt access address corresponds unit memory either enough memory installed
beyond range available memory architecture support address
The first case may certain platform architecture called segfault
The second case possible current implementation pointer bit long address extend bit
Pointers must conform certain rule canonical address pointer dereferenced processor raise
On hand system unit memory address
In case complex scheme employed use different part memory different time
The last incarnation architecture support bit physical memory address mapped linear address space paging mechanism
Thus possible total memory may accessed time
Another example computer family processor though supporting MB physical memory could access GB virtual memory combination address segment register made accessing KB one data structure cumbersome
In order provide consistent interface architecture provide allows address refer unit memory others refer device computer
There analogous concept file offset array index remote object reference serve purpose address type object
Pointers directly supported without restriction language implicitly
They primarily used constructing turn fundamental constructing nearly well passing data different part program
In functional programming language rely heavily list pointer reference managed abstractly language using internal construct like
When dealing array critical operation typically involves stage called involves constructing pointer desired data element array
In data structure pointer used reference explicitly tie one piece structure another
Pointers used pas parameter reference
This useful programmer want function modification parameter visible function caller
This also useful returning multiple value function
Pointers also used deallocate dynamic variable array memory
Since variable often become redundant served purpose waste memory keep therefore good practice deallocate using original pointer reference longer needed
Failure may result available free memory gradually severe case rapidly diminishes accumulation numerous redundant memory block
The basic define pointer This declares identifier object following type This usually stated succinctly pointer
Because C language specify implicit initialization object automatic storage duration care often taken ensure address point valid sometimes suggested pointer explicitly initialized value traditionally specified C standardized macro Dereferencing null pointer C produce could catastrophic
However implementation simply halt execution program question usually
However initializing pointer unnecessarily could hinder program analysis thereby hiding bug
In case pointer declared next logical step point something This assigns value address
For example stored memory location value assignment
To dereference pointer asterisk used This mean take content locate address memory set value
If later accessed new value
This example may clearer memory examined directly
Assume located address memory also assume machine int wide
The following would memory following code snippet executed The NULL pointer shown
By assigning address yield following memory value Then dereferencing coding computer take content address assign location yielding following memory Clearly accessing yield value previous instruction modified content way pointer
In C array indexing formally defined term pointer arithmetic language specification requires equivalent
Thus C array thought pointer consecutive area memory gap syntax accessing array identical used dereference pointer
For example array declared used following manner This allocates block five integer name block act pointer block
Another common use pointer point dynamically allocated memory return consecutive block memory le requested size used array
While operator array pointer equivalent result operator differs
In example evaluate size array evaluate size pointer
Default value array declared like If located memory starting address machine memory contain following value like address Represented five integer
These five integer occupy bit byte byte stored first stored consecutively starting address
The syntax C pointer The last example access content
Breaking Below example definition This definition essentially definition empty list cell type another link also type
The definition reference however use potentially confusing signal value
For reason data structure C usually dealt via carefully checked correctness
Pointers used pas variable address allowing value changed
For example consider following code In program required memory depends may enter
In case programmer need allocate memory dynamically
This done allocating memory rather variable usually stored
Variables also stored CPU register another matter Dynamic memory allocation made pointer name like common variable ca given
Pointers used store manage address block memory
Such block used store data object array object
Most structured language provide area memory called object dynamically allocated
The example C code illustrates structure object dynamically allocated referenced
The provides function allocating memory block heap
It take size object allocate parameter return pointer newly allocated block memory suitable storing object return null pointer allocation failed
The code illustrates memory object dynamically deallocated returned heap free store
The standard C library provides function deallocating previously allocated memory block returning back heap
On computing architecture pointer used directly manipulate memory device
Assigning address pointer invaluable tool programming
Below simple example declaring pointer type int initialising address example constant In mid using access video capability PCs slow
Applications typically used access video memory directly casting constant pointer array unsigned int value
Each value consisted code low byte colour high byte
Thus put letter row column bright white blue one would write code like following In many language pointer additional restriction object point specific
For example pointer may declared point language attempt prevent programmer pointing object integer eliminating error
For example C would integer pointer would char pointer
The following would yield compiler warning assignment incompatible pointer type declared different type
To suppress compiler warning must made explicit indeed wish make assignment say cast integer pointer char pointer assign
A draft C standard requires casting pointer derived one type one another type maintain alignment correctness type Pointers par
In language allow pointer arithmetic arithmetic pointer take account size type
For example adding integer number pointer produce another pointer point address higher number time size type
This allows u easily compute address element array given type shown C array example
When pointer one type cast another type different size programmer expect pointer arithmetic calculated differently
In C example array start byte whereas byte point would point
Other risk casting include loss data wide data written narrow location
unexpected result value comparison problem especially signed v unsigned value
Although impossible general determine cast safe language store used confirm dangerous cast valid runtime
Other language merely accept conservative approximation safe cast none
As pointer allows program attempt access object may defined pointer origin variety
However usefulness pointer great difficult perform programming task without
Consequently many language created construct designed provide useful feature pointer without also sometimes referred
In context pointer directly address memory used article referred contrast smart pointer variant
One major problem pointer long directly manipulated number made point unused address data used purpose
Many language including recent like replace pointer opaque type reference typically referred simply used refer object manipulated number preventing type error
Array indexing handled special case
A pointer address assigned called
Any attempt use uninitialized pointer cause unexpected behavior either initial value valid address using may damage part program
The result often used function pointer branch address
In system explicit memory allocation possible create deallocating memory region point
This type pointer dangerous subtle deallocated memory region may contain data deallocated may reallocated overwritten unrelated code unknown earlier code
Languages prevent type error deallocation performed automatically reference scope
Some language like support use simple form help track allocation dynamic memory addition acting reference
In absence reference cycle object refers indirectly sequence smart pointer eliminate possibility dangling pointer memory leak
string support reference counting natively
The introduces optimisation based around eliminate pointer bug without resorting
A value reserved indicating pointer refer valid object
Null pointer routinely used represent condition end unknown length failure perform action use null pointer compared value
An pointer whose value interpreted offset address pointer thus data structure autorelative pointer member point portion data structure data structure may relocated memory without update value auto relative pointer
The cited patent also us term mean thing
However meaning term used way A pointer whose value offset value another pointer
This used store load block data assigning address beginning block base pointer
In language pointer reference another pointer requiring multiple dereference operation get original value
While level indirection may add performance cost sometimes necessary order provide correct behavior complex
For example C typical define term element contains pointer next element list This implementation us pointer first element list surrogate entire list
If new value added beginning list changed point new element
Since C argument always passed value using double indirection allows insertion implemented correctly desirable eliminating special case code deal insertion front list In case value le caller properly updated address new item
A basic example argument given prototype variable pointer array string array array pointer string convention name program character string
In language pointer reference executable code point function method procedure
A store address function invoked
While facility used call function dynamically often favorite technique virus malicious software writer
A pointer point valid object consequently may make program crash behave oddly
In pointer specifically initialized may point unpredictable address memory
The following example code show dangling pointer Here may point anywhere memory performing assignment corrupt unknown area memory trigger
In doubly back pointer held element back item referring current element
These useful navigation manipulation expense greater memory use
These pointer declaration cover variant pointer declaration
Of course possible triple pointer main principle behind triple pointer already exist double pointer
The higher priority
Where pointer used address entry point program start also either uninitialized corrupted call nevertheless made address said occurred
The consequence usually unpredictable error may present several different way depending upon whether pointer valid address whether coincidentally valid instruction opcode address
The detection wild branch present one difficult frustrating debugging exercise since much evidence may already destroyed beforehand execution one inappropriate instruction branch location
If available usually detect wild branch take effect also provide complete partial trace history
It possible simulate pointer behavior using index normally array
Primarily language support pointer explicitly support array thought processed entire memory range within scope particular array index thought equivalent assembly language point individual byte whose actual value relative start array absolute address memory
Assuming array say contiguous character individual byte contiguous byte within array directly addressed manipulated using name array bit unsigned simulated pointer quite similar example shown
Pointer arithmetic simulated adding subtracting index minimal additional overhead compared genuine pointer arithmetic
It even theoretically possible using technique together suitable simulate intermediate another language support pointer example
To achieve code initially loaded contiguous byte array simulator read interpret action entirely within memory contained array
If necessary completely avoid problem usually actioned compiler hand coded simulator
strongly typed language pointer typed safe type conversion permitted
All pointer default initialized attempt access data pointer cause raised
Pointers Ada called
Ada permit arithmetic access type although many compiler vendor provided feature Ada support safe arithmetic access type via package
Several old version Windows platform support STRPTR return address string VARPTR return address variable
Visual Basic also support OBJPTR return address object interface ADDRESSOF operator return address function
The type integer value equivalent held pointer type
Newer dialect exhaustive pointer implementation however
In FreeBASIC arithmetic pointer equivalent C treated though pointer byte width
pointer dereferenced Also casting type pointer generate warning
In pointer variable store address
Each pointer type point one freely cast pointer type function pointer object pointer
A special pointer type called void pointer allows pointing object limited fact dereferenced directly shall cast
The address often directly manipulated casting pointer integral type sufficient size though result may indeed cause undefined behavior earlier C standard integral type guaranteed large enough specifies defined implementation need provide
fully support C pointer C typecasting
It also support new group typecasting operator help catch unintended dangerous cast
Since also provides used situation safer alternative primitive C pointer
also support another form reference quite different pointer called simply
ability modify pointer target address arithmetic operation well magnitude comparison restricted language standard remain within bound single array object otherwise invoke
Adding subtracting pointer move multiple size
For example adding pointer integer value increment pointer
This effect incrementing pointer point next element contiguous array often intended result
Pointer arithmetic performed pointer size thus pointed address added although compiler perform byte arithmetic extension treating
Pointer arithmetic provides programmer single way dealing different type adding subtracting number element required instead actual offset byte
Pointer arithmetic pointer us byte offset definition
In particular C definition explicitly declares syntax element array equivalent content element pointed
This implies equivalent one write equally well access fourth element array
While powerful pointer arithmetic source
It tends confuse novice forcing different context expression ordinary arithmetic one pointer arithmetic one sometimes easy mistake one
In response many modern computer language example permit direct access memory using address
Also safe C dialect address many issue pointer
See discussion
The supported ANSI C generic pointer type
A pointer store address object function C implicitly converted object pointer type assignment must explicitly cast dereferenced
C used pointer purpose ANSI C
allow implicit conversion pointer type even assignment
This design decision avoid careless even unintended cast though compiler output warning error encountering cast
In reference void complement pointer void reference behave like alias variable point never variable whose type
In pointer supported certain condition block code including pointer must marked keyword
Such block usually require higher security permission allowed run
The syntax essentially address pointed either memory
However pointer managed memory pointer managed object must declared using keyword prevents moving pointed object part memory management pointer scope thus keeping pointer address valid
An exception using structure safe managed equivalent require unsafe code
This type often returned using method example The framework includes many class method namespaces class convert type example many type pointer example allow communication
Most method security permission requirement unmanaged code since affect arbitrary place memory
The programming language support pointer variable
Primitive group record data object declared within program inherently memory allocated within program space address data item typically single memory word
In program source code data item used like variable content implicitly accessed indirectly pointer
Memory space data object typically using external statement via embedded extended language construct statement
Extended version COBOL also provide pointer variable declared clause
The value pointer variable established modified using statement
Some extended version COBOL also provide variable capable storing
The language provides full support pointer data type including pointer structure string handling extensive
quite leap forward compared programming language time
The derivative C fully support C pointer C typecasting
The employ value reference semantics without pointer arithmetic
Nevertheless pointer class provided
They offer pointer arithmetic typecasting explicit memory management interfacing software feature
introduced strongly typed pointer capability
Fortran pointer contain simple memory address
They also encapsulate lower upper bound array dimension stride example support arbitrary array section metadata
An used associate variable attribute
The statement may also used associate pointer block memory
For example following code might used define create linked list structure add support procedure pointer
Also part feature support intrinsic function converting pointer Fortran pointer back
pointer
Its declaration syntax equivalent C written way around ending type
Unlike C Go garbage collection disallows pointer arithmetic
Reference type like exist
Some type like map channel boxed
internally pointer mutable structure initialized using function
In approach unified syntax pointer arrow operator dropped dot operator pointer refers field method dereferenced object
This however work level indirection
Unlike explicit representation pointer
Instead complex data structure like implemented using
The language provide explicit pointer manipulation operator
It still possible code attempt dereference null reference null pointer however result thrown
The space occupied unreferenced memory object recovered automatically
Pointers implemented much Pascal parameter procedure call
even strongly typed Pascal fewer way escape type system
Some variant include garbage collection
Much pointer available
There still fewer way evade type system variant still safer respect pointer variant
As garbage collection part language specification
Unlike many language feature pointer standard allows pointer reference dynamically created variable anonymous allow reference standard static local variable
It pointer arithmetic
Pointers also must associated type pointer one type compatible pointer another type
pointer char compatible pointer integer
This help eliminate type security issue inherent pointer implementation particularly used
It also remove risk caused ability dynamically let go referenced space using standard procedure effect library function found mean risk dangling pointer entirely eliminated
However commercial open source Pascal derivative compiler implementation pointer allowed reference standard static local variable cast one pointer type another
Moreover pointer arithmetic unrestricted adding subtracting pointer move number byte either direction using standard procedure move pointer size point
An untyped pointer also provided name compatible pointer type
The support pointer although rarely used form pack unpack function
These intended simple interaction compiled OS library
In case Perl us typed allow form pointer arithmetic
They used construct complex data structure

Outline architecture central processing unit CPU function arithmetic logic unit ALU control unit CU register within CPU
A major defining point history computing realisation data instruction manipulate data logically could stored place
The computer design built upon principle became known still basis computer today
Although name honour John von Neumann brilliant mathematician worked construction atomic bomb idea probably originated Presper Echkert John Mauchly two early pioneer worked ENIAC Moore School University Pennsylvania time period
Another major characteristic von Neumann architecture unit process information separate unit store information
This characteristic lead following component von Neumann architecture
Memory collection cell unique physical address
We use generic word cell rather byte number bit addressable location called memory varies one machine another
Today computer byte addressable
To fully illustrate concept memory take computer RAM example
The memory consists byte mean byte computer uniquely addressable machine bit
The cell memory numbered consecutively beginning
For example cell memory cell would addressed follows What content address
The bit pattern stored location
However content actually represents instruction value sign etc
discussed later
What important however understand bit pattern information interpreted
When referring bit byte word bit numbered right left beginning zero
The bit address numbered follows The capable performing basic arithmetic operation adding subtracting multiplying dividing two number
This unit also capable performing logical operation
The operates word natural unit data associated particular computer design
Historically word length computer number bit processed
However current Intel line processor blurred definition defining word length bit
The processor work word bit double word bit quadwords bit
In rest wiki referring word historical nature aforementioned
Most modern small number special storage unit called
These register contain one word used store information needed immediately
For example calculation
first added result multiplied
Rather storing result adding memory retrieving multiply result left register content register multiplied
Access register much faster access memory location
All computing power world would useful one could input value calculation outside report outside result said calculation
Input output unit channel computer communicates outside world
An device data program outside world entered computer
The first input unit interpreted hole punched paper tape card
input device however include limited keyboard mouse camera also known simply webcam scanning device
An device result stored computer memory made available outside world
Examples include printer screen monitor
The organising force computer charge
There two special register control unit
The contains instruction executed contains address next instruction executed
Because control unit work closely together often thought one unit called
Above simplified view flow information part von Neumann machine
The part connected one another collection wire called bus data travel computer
Each bus carry three kind information address data control
An address used select memory location device data go taken
Data flow bus CPU memory Devices
The control information used manage flow address data
For example control signal typically used determine direction data flowing either CPU
The number bit transfer simultaneously
The wider bus address data bit move
Explain use cache memory
Because memory access time consuming relative speed processor many architecture provide
Cache memory small amount memory copy frequently used data stored
Before main memory access made CPU check whether data stored cache memory
another technique used speed
This technique split instruction smaller step overlapped
In personal computer component von Neumann machine reside physically printed circuit board called
The motherboard also connection attaching device bus mouse keyboard additional storage device
So mean say machine processor
The variable usually refers number bit CPU general register Two number added single instruction
It also refer width bus size addressable always
In addition refer width data always
Explain machine instruction cycle
Before looking computer let u look
The definition computer outline capability computer electronic device store retrieve process data
Therefore instruction give computer relate storing retrieving processing data
The underlying principle von Neumann machine data instruction stored memory treated alike
This mean instruction data addressable
Instructions stored contiguous memory location data manipulated stored together different part memory
To start Cycle first data loaded main memory operating system address first instruction placed onto
The process cycle includes four step The increment one one point next instruction executed control unit go address memory address register hold address next instruction specified take main memory address bus return memory buffer register via data bus
The MBR two way register temporarily hold data fetched Memory cache RAM make copy content place copy
At point contains instruction executed
Before going next step cycle must updated hold address next instruction executed current instruction completed
There instruction register responsible instruction solved CU
CU check status instruction allows execution
Because instruction stored contiguously memory adding number byte current instruction put address next instruction
Thus control unit increment
It possible may changed later instruction executed
In case instruction must get additional data memory sends address memory bus memory responds returning value location
In computer data retrieved memory may immediately participate arithmetic logical operation
Other computer simply save data returned memory register processing subsequent instruction
At end execution result instruction may saved either register memory
To execute instruction instruction register control unit determine instruction
It might instruction access data input device send data output device perform operation data value
At phase instruction decoded control signal
That logic circuitry determines operation executed
This step show computer execute instruction expressed machine language
The instruction literally built circuit
The instruction executed may potentially require additional memory access complete task
For example instruction say add content memory location register control unit must get content memory location
Once instruction decoded operand data fetched control unit ready execute instruction
Execution involves sending signal unit carry processing
In case adding number register operand sent added content register
When execution complete cycle begin
If last instruction add value content register next instruction probably say store result place memory
However next instruction might control instruction asks question result last instruction perhaps change content program counter
Hardware changed dramatically last yet von Neumann model remains basis computer today
As Alan Perlis computer scientist said Describe primary memory
RAM stand Memory
RAM memory cell usually byte directly accessed
Inherent idea able access location ability content location
That storing something else place change bit pattern cell
In addition RAM computer contain second kind memory called ROM
ROM stand Memory
The content location ROM changed
Their content permanent altered second operation
Placing bit pattern ROM called
The bit pattern burnt either time ROM manufactured time computer part assembled
RAM ROM differentiated basic property RAM ROM
This mean RAM retain bit configuration power turned ROM
Because ROM stable changed used store instruction computer need start
Frequently used software also stored ROM system read software time machine turned
Main memory usually contains ROM along RAM
Identify need persistent storage
An input device mean data program entered computer stored memory
An output device mean result sent back user
Because main memory volatile limited essential type storage device program data stored longer processed machine turned
These type storage device main memory called storage device
Because data must read written storage device also input output device

Recall executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another cycle
technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform keep track program memory memory reside
Another key operating system concept idea defined program execution
A program static set instruction
A process dynamic entity represents program executed
Through multiprogramming computer system might many active process
The operating system must manage process carefully
At point time specific instruction may next executed

A process might interrupted execution operating system performs carefully track progress process intermediate state

The Computer Science Guide clearly note technical detail needed
For example memory management described handled multitasking environment expected
Therefore section serve purpose illustrating memory management technique summarised rather utilised exam
Has operating system one program memory one time
This basic type memory management
The memory broken different part
Has operating system number program running time different partition
The partition base bound register
Base register Bounds register Partition selection First fit Best fit Worst fit A technique process divided page stored memory frame loaded
Frame Page The number system specifies number digit used system
The digit always begin continue one le base
For example digit base
There digit base
There digit base
The base also determines position digit mean
When one add last digit number system one carry digit position left
Numbers written using
The rightmost digit represents value multiplied base zeroth power
The digit left one represents value multiplied base first power
The next digit represents value multiplied base second power
The next digit represents value multiplied base third power
One usually familiar positional notation even aware
One instinctively inclined utilise method calculate number one A formal way defining positional notation say value represented polynomial base number system
But polynomial
A polynomial sum two algebriac term consists constant multiplied one variable raised integral power
When defining positional notation variable base number system
Thus represented polynomial follows acting base To express idea formally number number system digit represented follows represents digit th position number Look complicated
Take concrete example base
Here number exactly digit base
The formula state fifth digit last digit left multiplied base fourth power fourth digit multiplied base third power In previous calculation one assumed number base
This logical assumption generic number system base
However reason number could represent value base
In order distinguish value general notation utilised order represent number base
Therefore number found base system
In order turn turn one simply us previous calculation Therefore base equal base
One must keep mind two number equivalent value
That represent number thing
If one bag contains bean second bag contains bean bag contain exact number bean
The number system allow one represent value various way
Note base rightmost digit one position
In base rightmost digit also one position
In fact true base anything raised power zero one
Why would anyone want represent value base
It done often granted sometimes helpful understand work
For example computing technique called hashing take number scramble one way scramble number interpret different base
Other base base binary particularly important computer processing
The binary number system particularly important computing
It also helpful familiar number system power ase base octal base hexadecimal
Recall base digit base two digit base eight digit
Therefore number could represent value base le digit exist base
It however valid number base base higher
Likewise number valid number base higher simply exist us digit base lower
What digit base higher
One need assign symbol represent digit correspond decimal value beyond
In base higher one generally look towards letter digit
The letter A consequently represent number B represent C represent forth
Therefore digit base Focusing value binary octal hexadecimal represent number base one calculate example decimal equivalent octal base simply put finding
As case expanding number polynomial form adding number And converting hexadecimal number decimal Define Boolean operator AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
Construct truth table using operator
The gate computer sometimes referred logic gate perform one logical function
That gate accepts one input value produce single output value
Because one dealing binary information input output either corresponding signal corresponding signal
The type gate input value determine output value
A NOT gate accepts one input value produce one output value
The table right illustrates NOT gate three way Boolean expression logical diagram symbol using truth table
In representation variable represents input signal either
The variable represents output signal whose value determined value
By definition input value NOT gate output input value output
A NOT gate sometimes referred inverts input value
In Boolean expression NOT operation represented mark value begin negated
Sometimes operation shown horizontal bar value begin negated
In Boolean expression table assigned value determined applying NOT operation input value
In variable left equal sign take value expression side
The logical diagram symbol NOT gate triangle small circle called end
The input output shown line flowing gate
Sometimes line labeled though always
The truth table show possible input value NOT gate well corresponding output value
Because one input signal NOT gate signal two possibility column labelled A truth table
The column labelled show output gate inverse input
Note three representation truth table actually defines behaviour gate situation
These three notation different way representing thing example result Boolean expression always result Boolean expression always
This behaviour consistent value shown truth table
Unlike NOT gate accepts one input signal AND gate accepts two input signal
The value input signal determine output signal
If two input value AND gate output otherwise output
The AND operation Boolean algebra expressed using single dot case asterisk
Often operator assumed example often written
Because two input two possible value input four possible combination provided input AND gate
Therefore four situation occur AND operator used Boolean expression
Likewise truth table showing behaviour AND gate four row showing four possible input combination
Like AND gate two input OR gate
If two input value output value otherwise input
The Boolean algebra OR operation expressed using plus sign
The OR gate two input one two value AND gate four input combination therefore four row truth table
The XOR OR gate illustrated right
An XOR gate produce two input otherwise
Note difference XOR gate OR gate differ one input situation
When input signal OR gate produce XOR produce
Sometimes regular OR gate referred OR produce either input
The XOR produce input mixed one one
Think XOR gate saying When I say I mean one
The Boolean algebra symbol sometimes used express XOR operation
However XOR operation also expressed using operator leave exercise
Note logic diagram symbol XOR gate like symbol OR gate except extra curved line connecting input signal
The NAND NOR gate accept two input value
The NAND NOR gate essentially opposite AND OR gate respectively
That output NAND gate one took output AND gate put inverter NOT gate
There typically specific symbol used express NAND NOR gate operation Boolean algebra
Instead one rely definition express concept
That Boolean algebra expression NAND negation AND operation
Likewise Boolean algebra expression NOR negation OR operation
The logic diagram symbol NAND NOR AND OR except NAND NOR symbol inversion bubble indicate negation
Compare output column truth table AND NAND
They opposite row row
The true OR NOR gate
Six specific type gate observed
It may seem difficult task keep straight remember work
Well probably depends one think
One encouraged try memorise truth table
The processing gate described briefly general term
If one think way one produce appropriate truth table time needed
Some description term input value cause gate produce n output case produce Construct logic diagram using AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
A combinational circuit consists logic gate whose output determined time present combination input irrespective previous consists input variable logic gate output variable
The logic gate accept signal input generate signal example combinational circuit binary adder decimal adder decoder multiplexer half adder half subtractor etc
A logic circuit addition two number called half adder
addition process reproduced truth table

The enacted Title III
The act recognized importance economic national security interest United States
The act requires develop document implement program provide information support operation asset agency including provided managed another agency source
FISMA brought attention within federal government explicitly emphasized policy security
FISMA requires agency program official chief information officer inspector general IGs conduct annual review agency information security program report result OMB
OMB us data assist oversight responsibility prepare annual report Congress agency compliance act
In FY federal agency spent billion securing government total information technology investment approximately billion percent total information technology portfolio
FISMA assigns specific responsibility NIST OMB order strengthen information security system
In particular FISMA requires head agency implement policy procedure reduce information technology security risk acceptable level
According FISMA term mean protecting information information system unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification destruction order provide integrity confidentiality availability
In accordance FISMA responsible developing standard guideline associated method technique providing adequate information security agency operation asset excluding national security system
NIST work closely federal agency improve understanding implementation FISMA protect information information system publishes standard guideline provide foundation strong information security program agency
NIST performs statutory responsibility Computer Security Division Information Technology Laboratory
NIST develops standard metric test validation program promote measure validate security information system service
NIST host following FISMA defines framework managing information security must followed used operated federal government agency executive legislative branch contractor organization behalf federal agency branch
This framework defined standard guideline developed
FISMA requires agency place information system inventory
According FISMA head agency shall develop maintain inventory major information system including major national security system operated control agency The identification information system inventory subsection shall include identification interface system system network including operated control agency
The first step determine constitutes question
There direct mapping computer information system rather information system may collection individual computer put common purpose managed system owner
NIST SP Revision Guide Developing Security Plans Federal Information Systems provides guidance determining boundary
All information information system categorized based objective providing appropriate level information security according range risk level The first mandatory security standard required FISMA legislation Standards Security Categorization Federal Information Information Systems provides definition security category
The guideline provided NIST SP Guide Mapping Types Information Information Systems Security Categories
The overall FIPS system categorization high water mark impact rating criterion information type resident system
For example one information type system rating Low confidentiality integrity availability another type rating Low confidentiality availability rating Moderate integrity impact level integrity also becomes Moderate
Federal information system must meet minimum security requirement
These requirement defined second mandatory security standard required FISMA legislation Minimum Security Requirements Federal Information Information Systems
Organizations must meet minimum security requirement selecting appropriate security control assurance requirement described Recommended Security Controls Federal Information Systems
The process selecting appropriate security control assurance requirement organizational information system achieve adequate security multifaceted activity involving management operational personnel within organization
Agencies flexibility applying baseline security control accordance tailoring guidance provided Special Publication
This allows agency adjust security control closely fit mission requirement operational environment
The control selected planned must documented System Security Plan
The combination FIPS NIST Special Publication requires foundational level security federal information information system
The agency risk assessment validates security control set determines additional control needed protect agency operation including mission function image reputation agency asset individual organization Nation
The resulting set security control establishes level security due diligence federal agency contractor
A risk assessment start identifying potential mapping implemented individual vulnerability
One determines risk calculating likelihood impact given vulnerability could exploited taking account existing control
The culmination risk assessment show calculated risk vulnerability describes whether risk accepted mitigated
If mitigated implementation control one need describe additional Security Controls added system
NIST also initiated Information Security Automation Program ISAP SCAP support complement approach achieving consistent security control assessment
Agencies develop policy system security planning process
NIST introduces concept System Security Plan
System security plan living document require periodic review modification plan action milestone implementing security control
Procedures place outlining review plan keep plan current follows planned security control
The System security plan major input security certification accreditation process system
During security certification accreditation process system security plan analyzed updated accepted
The certification agent confirms security control described system security plan consistent FIPS security category determined information system threat vulnerability identification initial risk determination identified documented system security plan risk assessment equivalent document
Once system documentation risk assessment completed system control must reviewed certified functioning appropriately
Based result review information system accredited
The certification accreditation process defined NIST SP Guide Security Certification Accreditation Federal Information Systems
Security accreditation official management decision given senior agency official authorize operation information system explicitly accept risk agency operation agency asset individual based implementation set security control
Required Appendix III security accreditation provides form quality control challenge manager technical staff level implement effective security control possible information system given mission requirement technical constraint operational constraint constraint
By accrediting information system agency official accepts responsibility security system fully accountable adverse impact agency breach security occurs
Thus responsibility accountability core principle characterize security accreditation
It essential agency official complete accurate trustworthy information possible security status information system order make timely credible decision whether authorize operation system
The information supporting evidence needed security accreditation developed detailed security review information system typically referred security certification
Security certification comprehensive assessment management operational technical security control information system made support security accreditation determine extent control implemented correctly operating intended producing desired outcome respect meeting security requirement system
The result security certification used reassess risk update system security plan thus providing factual basis authorizing official render security accreditation decision
All accredited system required monitor selected set security control system documentation updated reflect change modification system
Large change security profile system trigger updated risk assessment control significantly modified may need
Continuous monitoring activity include configuration management control information system component security impact analysis change system ongoing assessment security control status reporting
The organization establishes selection criterion subsequently selects subset security control employed within information system assessment
The organization also establishes schedule control monitoring ensure adequate coverage achieved
Security expert Bruce Brody former federal chief information security officer Alan Paller director research described FISMA fundamentally flawed tool arguing compliance reporting methodology mandated FISMA measure security planning rather measuring information security
Past chief technology officer Keith Rhodes said FISMA helped government system security implementation everything security people view FISMA checklist nothing going get done

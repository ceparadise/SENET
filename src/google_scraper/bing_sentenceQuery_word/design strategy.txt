Object Behavioral Define family algorithm encapsulate one make interchangeable let client algorithm vary independently client using
Suppose work company build strategy game
Let assume come following hierarchy class
All character able walk also method render screen
The superclass take care implementation method subclass provides implementation since character look different
A new requirement arrives character need fight
Simple job say add method superclass
But wait moment Workers
They fight
Well one could think could simply override method subclass nothing
But future need class fight walk
We need cleaner solution
What taking fight walk behavior superclass interface
That way character supposed walk implement Walkable interface character supposed fight implement interface
Well another way say duplicate code
What need make small change fight behavior
You would need modify class
At point put three design principle follow application development So let apply design principle
Pull fight walk behavior different class
And apply design principle well pull behavior interface
Hence create new WeaponBehavior interface deal fight behavior similarly WalkBehavior interface deal walk behavior
behavior live separate class implement particular behavior interface
That way class need know implementation detail behavior
In addition rely implementation interface
Other type object use behavior hidden inside class
And add new behavior without modifying existing one touching character class
So class delegate behavior information two behavior interface come design principle
We adding two instance variable
Each character object set variable polymorphically reference specific behavior type would like runtime
Think behavior family algorithm
So composition give lot flexibility
Not let encapsulate family algorithm set class also let change behavior runtime long object composing implement correct behavior interface
Find example
Think twice implementing pattern
You sure need frequently change algorithm
You clearly anticipate future otherwise pattern expensive basic implementation
This pattern expensive create
This pattern expensive maintain
If representation class often change lot refactoring
This pattern hard remove
The strategy pattern A struct used define class strategy set using function pointer
The following mirror Python example us feature The strategy pattern similar Java require dynamic allocation object
Delegates follow strategy pattern delegate definition defines strategy interface delegate instance represents concrete strategy
defines Func delegate used quickly implement strategy pattern shown example
Note different method defining delegate instance
An example Using strategy class In Common Lisp using first class function Similar Python Scala support function
The following implement basic functionality seen Python example
add procedure pointer abstract interface also function
The following mirror Python example
This Groovy example basic port Ruby using block example
In place Ruby block example us Groovy closure support
An example An example Similar Python Scala support function
The following implement basic functionality seen Python example
function Python JavaScript Scala pattern implemented without defining explicit subclass interface The strategy pattern formally implemented The strategy pattern function called ScriptBlocks pattern modeled like Python passing function directly context instead defining class
An alternative using An example Another example Python Python function pattern used simply passing function directly context instead defining class method containing function
One loses information interface strategy made explicit however simplifying pattern manner
Here example might encounter GUI programming using callback function An example The previous ruby example us typical OO feature effect accomplished ruby block much le code
Like Python also support function
The following implement basic functionality shown Python example

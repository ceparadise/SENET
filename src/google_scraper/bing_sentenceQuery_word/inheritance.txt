In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

In language way add functionality
programming notion class perhaps interface
A inherits field method parent class
It modify behaviour parent adding new field method modifying existing one
Depending programming language used may certain restriction extending class
Inheritance used solve different type problem An example Car class
You could create Ferrari class would inherit Car also make Toyota class would also inherit Car
This way field method drive method brake method color field would also inside Ferrari Toyota would need copy code twice
However maybe inside Car could brand field
This brand field would equal nothing inside Ferrari field might equal ferrari Toyota toyota
Of course could create Car otherwise field would missing
In order prevent people creating Car turn Car abstract class

class Member public Member cout class Base public Base cout Memeber member class Derived public Base public Derived cout int main Derived der Given code output program
When object created order everything created follows
Member variable created first

The constructor parent class called object parent
The object constructor called
Following code see Derived object created main
Since Derived class parent call order jump Base class
Now inside Base class nothing outputted yet
Inside Base class local variable created first
This brings u Member class
In Member class constructor called outputted
After jump back constructor Base class outputted
Finally get back started Derived class
The constructor derived called outputted
The final output
Which following represents redefinition utilizes benefit inheritance
We know square really subclass rectangle merely rectangle four side equal
Using inheritance easily reuse much code
First need extend class Next rid field This allows alter constructor call constructor
You using Rectangle superclass
After delete method handled superclass
This give simple bit code
Which following Object class
Object class never descendant
Every class Object method
Object inherits minimum four class
Object one superclass Entity
None answer true
Every class Object method
Object basic class others even user made one inherit
Therefore class Object method
A way think class think tree Object class lowest node tree node connect back
True False
The class BetterMan inherits class Man
False True True The class BetterMan inherits method class man
The keyword extends mean BetterMan get method Man plus able extend class adding method
All method Man used BetterMan calling keyword better
What code print
Runtime Error Parent called Child called Compiler Error Child called Parent called Compiler Error Final method ca overriden
So code wo compile
Now final modifier removed
The code would compile run produce Child class Pet public Pet virtual void bar cout In pet bar class Cat public Pet public virtual void eat cout Cat eating virtual void bar cout In Cat bar Given class would result int main Pet petPtr new Cat petPtr eat Compilation error The program run print Pet eating The program compiles runtime error None The program run print Cat eating Compilation error When child class inherits property parent class attribute inherited

This article kept following
Note suggested another article merged one
August UTC See also I commented reference CSS example inheritance CSS behave inheritance possible actually inherit class modify
Instead get override prior definition
I sure full disagreement
CSS definitely cascade really inherit
I almost removed change I realized month since I actually cursed design CSS trying get true inheritance I could remember specific well enough clearly detail
Maybe I go try CSS I remember I hate much wish
Oct UTC Tell ya next time I work CSS run reason dislike belief object oriented I rush give full narrative
Right I ca remember
BTW I prefer CSS nothing I dislike
Oct UTC Well standard call inheritance property loosely inherited child element part computer science coverage topic
Obviously pure representation I thinking writng
But article broader OOP computer science instead confined OOP view concept
OOP purist maybe right viewpoint general overview whole concept
Mike please let rip compare contrast produce good coverage similarity difference use inheritance CS
Oct UTC This something worm may onto
I invite refer several month worth discussion already
It surprising emotionally entangled one get seemingly simple issue naming article
I agree whatever happening CSS certainly kind relationship I would prefer principle implied current article since already covering
infancy need ton work I probably qualified please feel free improve
As might gather discussion disagreement whether inheritance make sense outside OOP context
I think area computer science inheritance concept yet nothing programming
CSS one open debate whether really called inheritance refers I think least mention
Of course limit CSS think circumstance outside OOP form inheritance used would great
Nov UTC Mike thanks sort thing I thought end writing sort thing I writing I thinking programmer mode
It part I want OOP version CS article
The Wikipedia descriptive prescriptive describe us term
Hence word processing easy understand introduction CSS really common use OOP another common use
The article need remarked either adjust definition include us multiple definition cover class meaning
Then get compare contrast refer article detail topic define use term
At point really comprehensive coverage inheritance mean field
And Inheritance OOP really purist mean inheritance CSS meaning
Nov UTC This comment part Controversial Articles list References contain link outside Wikipedia Here history concept Here content Inheritance expressed keyword Java relationship notation
The concept reifies relationship
Thus proposition Socrates Man state Nov UTC It seems article heading straight road Inheritance exists programming
The opening sentence even state inheritance creates relationship
There whether article exist reasonable justification existence notion inheritance make sense outside context OOP I think try make article inheritance occurs way computer science
Jan UTC OK I gon na dive rewrite
No offense contributed current version stand strongly structured towards programming concept inheritance I think article relatively short something like disambiguation page since already brief discussion potential alternate meaning inheritance broadly area CSS word processor style implementation inheritance concept language
Some mention also disagreement true inheritance believe inheritance make sense outside OOP case article even exist like believe least mention case word inheritance used even though true inheritance whatever kind
Here go Feb UTC Attempts reading topic lead way redirects expression even mentioned article
I wish people trigger happy redirects without actual work topic making sure loss way
In fact original topic stand enlightening redirects replaced
Inheritance dual view thing
I would rather say partially overlap concept
Also dual view stuff explained quite poorly IMHO article
Having said I discovered two inheritance page OOP Computer science frankly I lost interest
Good luck
October UTC The introduction currently read However far I understand term inheritance also used within framework class exist independent entity
I think usage reflected definition
June UTC currently redirects since creation
Is specific reason
Otherwise I would turn redirect
June UTC From second paragraph Categorization powerful mechanism number information processing
This make sense error somewhere
As I quite sure writer trying say rather correcting I make note someone else correct
In section meant
February UTC Hello
I suppose example text would certainly reinforce idea nicely
This one seems miss example common computer science article
July UTC Aijaz inheritance inheritance inheritance inheritance inheritance

two class share functionality
You use want create new class utilize existing code another class
In case derive new class existing class
By utilize method existing class without rewrite code
inheritance relationship class
also known inheritance tree
It important know hierarchy
The contains many useful method others
The away go exclusive class behavior
Here example inheritance tree As see start move get defined go tree
Whenever pas method class travel inheritance tree suitable definition found
Lets say start class call
The message sent tree get
Once get method found utilized
The class extends another class inherits another class
The class utilized
It important know inherits everything
This includes class method field
In order show class relates another use keyword
Here example class extends class In example
We call constructor superclass directly subclass using key work
Here class extends class
We use call constructor create square
There many thing subclass since inherits private public member parent class
It important remember Here example inheritance utilizing class

In Greek many much form shape provision single entity different
A one whose operation also applied value type type
There several fundamentally different kind polymorphism The interaction parametric polymorphism subtyping lead concept
Ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism originally described set lecture note written British computer scientist
In paper introduced term model subtypes
However implementation subtyping inheritance predate term inclusion polymorphism appeared chose term refer polymorphic function applied argument different type behave differently depending type argument applied also known
The term context intended pejorative refers simply fact type polymorphism fundamental feature type system
In example function seem work generically various type looking invocation considered two entirely distinct function compiler intent purpose In language situation complex correct function need invoked might determinable run time
Implicit type conversion also defined form polymorphism referred coercion polymorphism
allows function data type written generically handle value without depending type
Parametric polymorphism way make language expressive still maintaining full static
The concept parametric polymorphism applies
A function evaluate applied value different type known A data type appear generalized type
element arbitrary type designated like generalized type specialization made
Parametric polymorphism ubiquitous functional programming often simply referred polymorphism
The following example show parametrized list data type two parametrically polymorphic function Parametric polymorphism also available several language
For instance D name C Java later formally developed notion polymorphism extension lambda calculus called polymorphic lambda calculus
Any parametrically polymorphic function necessarily restricted working shape data instead value leading concept
Some language employ idea also called restrict range type used particular case polymorphism
In language subtyping allows function written take object certain type also work correctly passed object belongs type subtype according
This type relation sometimes written
Conversely said
Subtype polymorphism usually resolved dynamically see
In following example make cat dog subtypes animal
The procedure accepts animal also work correctly subtype passed In another example type function written take work equally well passed passed
The actual type object hidden client accessed via object
In fact type may even possible get hand object whose type see
This particular kind type hierarchy context usually contains many type
offer subtype polymorphism using also known
In typical implementation class contains called table function implement polymorphic part class object contains pointer vtable class consulted whenever polymorphic method called
This mechanism example The go popular object system
Some however provide method call polymorphic argument
Row Polymorphism similar distinct concept subtyping
It deal
It allows usage value whose type certain property without losing remaining type information
A related concept
A polytypic function general polymorphic function though one provide fixed ad hoc case specific data type ad hoc combinator absent
Polymorphism distinguished implementation selected statically compile time dynamically run time typically via
This known respectively corresponding form polymorphism accordingly called
Static polymorphism executes faster dynamic dispatch overhead requires additional compiler support
Further static polymorphism allows greater static analysis compiler notably optimization source code analysis tool human reader programmer
Dynamic polymorphism flexible example dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing dynamically linked library may operate object without knowing full type
Static polymorphism typically occurs ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism whereas dynamic polymorphism usual subtype polymorphism
However possible achieve static polymorphism subtyping sophisticated use namely

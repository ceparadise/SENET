In simply physical virtual component limited availability within computer system
Every device connected computer system resource
Every internal system component resource
Virtual system resource include concretely network connection concretely memory area
Managing resource referred includes preventing releasing resource process finished using dealing multiple process wish access limited resource
Some resource notably memory storage space notion location one distinguish allocation allocation
For example allocating GiB memory single block versus allocating block size MiB
The latter known often severely impact performance free space subcategory general resource storage space
One also distinguish resource resource
Compressible resource generally throughput one CPU network bandwidth throttled benignly user slowed proportionally throttling otherwise proceed normally
Other resource generally storage one memory throttled without either causing failure process allocate enough memory typically run severe performance degradation due working set fit memory requires frequent paging progress slow significantly
The distinction always sharp mentioned paging system allow main memory primary storage compressed paging hard drive secondary storage system allow cache compressible without disastrous performance impact
Electrical power degree compressible without power without sufficient voltage electrical device run stop crash device notably mobile phone allow degraded operation reduced power consumption allow device suspended terminated much lower power consumption

In refers technique managing component limited availability
may manage resource using feature exposed survey article contrasting different approach may elect manage host another program
management known consists cleaning resource leak terminating access resource acquired released use
This known resource analogous memory
On many system operating system reclaims resource process make
The act refusing release resource process finished using known issue sequential computing
Multiple process wish access limited resource issue known
Resource management seek control access order prevent situation
Formally resource management preventing resource leak consists ensuring resource released successfully acquired
This general problem abstracted code normally executed order condition code called code successfully completes regardless whether code executes successfully
This also known occurs various context temporary change program state entry exit
However resource management commonly cited application
In terminology resource release must successful resource acquisition failure ensure bug code path violates condition cause resource leak
Resource leak often minor problem generally crashing program instead causing slowdown program overall system
However may cause crash either program program due system run resource acquisition request fail
This present attack cause resource exhaustion
Resource leak may happen regular program flow simply forgetting release resource exceptional circumstance resource released exception another part program
Resource leak frequently caused subroutine either statement exception raised either subroutine deeper subroutine call
While resource release due return statement handled carefully releasing within subroutine return exception handled without additional language facility guarantee release code executed
More subtly successful resource acquisition must resource release otherwise code try release resource acquired
The consequence incorrect release range silently ignored crashing program unpredictable behavior
These bug generally manifest rarely require resource allocation first fail generally exceptional case
Further consequence may serious program may already crashing due failure acquire essential resource
However prevent recovery failure turn orderly shutdown disorderly shutdown
This condition generally ensured first checking resource successfully acquired releasing either boolean variable record successfully acquired lack atomicity resource acquired flag variable fails updated conversely handle resource null indicates successfully acquired ensures atomicity
Memory treated resource usually considered separately primarily memory allocation deallocation significantly frequent acquisition release resource file handle
Memory managed system similarity internal memory management since memory resource management since managed external system
Examples include memory managed via native code used Java via object DOM used
In case virtual machine unable manage external memory shared memory management thus external memory treated resource managed analogously
However cycle system JavaScript referring DOM referring back JavaScript make management difficult impossible
A key distinction resource management within program whether resource handled like stack variable lifetime restricted single acquired entry within particular scope released execution exit scope whether resource must handled like heap variable resource acquired within function returned must released outside acquiring function
Stack management common use case significantly easier handle heap management
The basic approach resource management acquire resource something release yielding code form illustrated opening file Python This correct intervening code contain early exit language exception guaranteed succeed
However cause resource leak return exception cause incorrect release unacquired resource fail
There two fundamental problem pair adjacent release code must written far acquisition code resource management encapsulated programmer must manually ensure always paired
In combination mean acquisition release must explicitly paired placed together thus making easy paired correctly
The resource leak resolved language support construction like Python placing body clause release clause This ensures correct release even return within body exception thrown
Further note acquisition occurs clause ensuring clause executed code succeeds without throwing exception assuming exception mean success case Python
If resource acquisition fail without throwing exception returning form must also checked release While ensures correct resource management fails provide adjacency encapsulation
In many language mechanism provide encapsulation statement Python The technique unwind protection form encapsulation common approach resource management found various form C Java Python Ruby among others date late NIL dialect Lisp see
There many variation implementation also significantly different
The common approach resource management across language use unwind protection called execution exit scope execution running end block returning within block exception thrown
This work resource implemented many language including C Common Lisp Java Python Ruby Scheme
The main problem approach release code commonly clause may distant acquisition code lack acquisition release code must always paired caller lack
These remedied either functionally using Common Lisp Ruby Scheme using object handle acquisition release adding language construct call method control enters exit scope C Java Python see
An alternative imperative approach write asynchronous code acquire resource next line release called scope exited synchronous acquisition followed asynchronous release
This originated ScopeGuard class Petru Marginean improvement Joshua Lehrer direct language support D via keyword one approach addition RAII see
It also included Go statement
This approach lack encapsulation one must explicitly match acquisition release avoids create object resource avoid writing class type resource
In resource encapsulated within object use object whose value general
This allows object use manage resource without user object needing
However wide variety way object resource related
Firstly question ownership object resource
Objects resource acquire release different way different point occur pair practice often used symmetrically see Most common acquire resource object creation explicitly release via instance method commonly called
This analogous traditional file management acquire release explicit known
This basic approach used several major modern language including language additional construct automate resource management
However even language complex object relationship result complex resource management discussed
A natural approach make holding resource resource acquired object creation specifically initialization released object destruction specifically finalization
This known RAII tie resource management ensuring live object necessary resource
Other approach make holding resource class invariant thus object may necessary resource acquired yet already released managed externally resulting error trying read closed file
This approach tie resource management memory management specifically object management memory leak object leak
RAII work naturally resource resource composable resource held object arbitrarily complicated relationship complicated released transparently simply object destruction long done properly
RAII standard resource management approach outside despite appeal work poorly modern automatic memory management specifically RAII resource management memory management significant difference
Firstly resource expensive desirable release promptly object holding resource destroyed soon become garbage longer use
Object destruction prompt deterministic memory management object destroyed stack unwind object destroyed manually via calling automatically using deterministic object destroyed immediately reference count fall thus RAII work well situation
However modern automatic memory management making guarantee object destroyed promptly even
This cheaper leave garbage allocated precisely collect object immediately becoming garbage
Secondly releasing resource object destruction mean object must deterministic memory management known object simply deallocated significantly complicates slows garbage collection
When multiple object rely single resource resource management complicated
A fundamental question whether relationship one another object another object
A common case one two object chained pattern
If second object used directly hold resource first object used directly responsible managing resource
This generally answered identically whether first object second object owning object also responsible resource management resource
Further single object may several object owning viewing others
Both case commonly found convention differ
Having object use resource indirectly responsible resource composition provides one need object client use without separate object resource result considerable complexity particularly resource shared multiple object object complex relationship
If object directly us resource responsible resource aggregation relationship object use resource ignored encapsulation beyond directly using object resource must managed directly might available indirectly using object released separately
object composition using dispose pattern owning object thus also method turn call method owned object must disposed RAII handled automatically long owned object automatically destroyed value raw pointer see
In object aggregation nothing need done viewing object responsible resource
Both commonly found
For example close underlying stream chained
For example may contain turn contains calling turn close turn close turn release system file resource
Indeed object directly us resource even anonymous thanks encapsulation However also possible manage object directly us resource use resource management wrapper object By contrast Python reading need possible close reader instead must closed
In convention direct user resource responsible You implement IDisposable type us unmanaged resource directly
In case complicated multiple object sharing resource cycle object hold resource proper resource management quite complicated exactly issue arise object finalization via destructors finalizers example occur cause resource leak using observer hold resource
Various mechanism exist allow greater control resource management
For example class provides method register object disposed object together various instance class method manage disposal
In stack resource management done simply nesting code sufficiently handle case
This requires single return end code result heavily nested code many resource must acquired considered due triangular shape successive nesting
One approach allows early return consolidates cleanup one place single exit return function preceded cleanup code use jump cleanup exit
This infrequently seen modern code occurs us C

A computer generally one operating system becomes active take control system turned
Computer hardware wired initially load small set system instruction stored
You likely used least one operating system
The various version Microsoft Windows NT XP Vista popular choice personal computer
UNIX favourite serious programmer year version UNIX called popular personal computer system
Identify resource need managed within computer system
The various role operating system generally revolve around idea sharing nicely
An operating system manages resource resource often shared one way another among various program want use multiple program executing concurrently share use main memory take turn using CPU compete opportunity use input output device
The operating system act playground monitor making sure everyone cooperates get chance play
There various aspect resource require management computer system including primary memory secondary memory processor bandwidth graphic sound network cache
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy virtual memory paging interrupt polling
An executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another
Multiprogramming technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform memory management keep track program memory memory reside
Memory continuous set bit referenced specific address
All program stored main memory executed
All data referenced program program also stored main memory accessed
Main memory thought big continuous chuck space divided group bit
Each byte word memory corresponding address simply integer uniquely identifies particular part memory
To right representation memory first memory address
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Earlier stated multiprogramming environment multiple program data stored main memory time
Thus operating system must employ technique A program filled reference variable part program code
When program compiled reference changed address memory data code resides
But since one know exactly program loaded main memory one know address use anything
The solution use two kind address logical address physical address
A logical address sometimes called virtual relative address value specifies generic location relative program reality main memory
A physical address actual address main memory device shown figure
When program compiled reference identifier variable name changed logical address
When program eventually loaded memory logical address finally corresponds specific physical address
The mapping logical address physical address called address binding
Logical address allow program moved around memory loaded different place different time
As long one keep track program stored one always able determine physical address corresponds given logical address
The following section examine underlying principle main memory management technique
To simplify example calculation performed base
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking paging interrupt polling
The demand paging approach give rise idea virtual memory illusion restriction size program entire program necessarily memory time
In memory management technique examined earlier entire process brought memory continuous whole
Therefore always upper bound process size
Demand paging remove restriction
However virtual memory come lot overhead execution program
With memory management technique program loaded memory ready go
With virtual memory approach one constantly swap page main secondary memory
This overhead usually acceptable one program waiting page swapped another process take control CPU make progress
Excessive page swapping called thrashing seriously degrade system performance
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Limitations resource specific computer system often closely related hardware system capability
Limitations could include The widely used device magnetic disk drive
It includes hard drive found computer main casing disk portable moved easily computer
Storing data onto secondary storage requires mechanism organising electron medium
As use individual file used user point view smallest amount data bet written secondary memory
A file system natural solution managing file logical view operating system provides user manage data collection file
A file system often organized grouping file directory
Additionally file generic concept
Different type file managed different way
A file general contains program form data one type another
Some file rigid format others flexible
The important hardware device used secondary memory magnetic disk drive
File system stored drive must accessed efficient manner
It turn transferring data secondary memory worst bottleneck general computer system
The speed CPU speed main memory much faster speed data transfer secondary memory magnetic disk
That process must perform disk made wait data transferred give another process chance use CPU
Because secondary slowest aspect general computer system technique accessing data disk drive crucial importance file system
As computer deal multiple process period time request access disk accumulate
The technique operating system us determine request satisfy called disk scheduling

Another important resource operating system must manage use CPU individual process
TO understand operating system manages process one must recognise stage process go computational life understand information must managed keep process working correctly computer system
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Processes move specific stage managed computer system
That process enters system ready executed executing waiting resource finished
Below flow chart represents process state
In figure box represents state process might arrow indicate process might move one state another
Examining happening process state Note many process may ready state waiting state time one process running state
After process created operating system admits ready state
When CPU scheduling algorithm dictate process dispatched running state
While running process might interrupted operating system allow another process chance CPU
In case process simply return ready state
Alternatively running process might request resource available requires retrieve newly referenced part process case moved waiting state
A running process may finally get enough CPU time complete processing terminate normally otherwise may generate unrecoverable error terminate abnormally
When waiting process get resource waiting move ready state
The operating system must manage large amount data active process
Usually data stored data structured called process control block PCB
Generally state represented list PCBs one process state
When process move one state another corresponding PCB move one state list another operating system
A new PCB created process first created new state persists process terminates

Related idea memory management process management need CPU scheduling determines process memory executed CPU given point
The problem capitalise computer greater capability speed led concept timesharing
A timesharing system allows multiple user interact computer time
Multiprogramming allowed multiple process active gave rise ability programmer interact computer system directly still sharing resource whereas timesharing system create illusion user exclusive access computer
That user actively compete resource though exactly happening behind scene
One user may actually know sharing machine user anything special allow
The operating system manages sharing resource including CPU behind scene
CPU scheduling act determining process ready state moved running state
That CPU scheduling algorithm decide process given CPU make computational progress
CPU scheduling decision made process switch running state waiting state program terminates
This type CPU scheduling called nonpreemptive scheduling need new CPU process result activity current executing process
CPU scheduling decision may also made process move running state ready state process move waiting state ready state
These example preemptive scheduling currently running process fault preempted operating system
Scheduling algorithm often evaluated using particular metric turnaround time process
This amount time time process arrives ready state time exit running state last time
One would like average turnaround time process small possible
There various approach used determine process get chosen first move ready state running state
Here examination three In FCFS scheduling approach process moved CPU order arrive running state
FCFS scheduling nonpreemptive
Once process given access CPU keep unless make request force wait request force wait request device use another process
The SJN CPU scheduling algorithm look process ready state dispatch one smallest service time
Like FCFS generally implemented nonpreemptive algorithm
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
CPU scheduling distributes processing time equitably among ready process
The algorithm establishes particular time slice time quantum amount time process receives preempted return ready state allow another process turn
Eventually preempted process given another time slice CPU
This procedure continues process eventually get time need terminates
Note algorithm preemptive
The expiration time slice arbitrary reason move process CPU
This action presented transition running state ready state

Operating system must also take account fact computer usually connected network
Today World Wide Web one would take network communication granted however vastly connected interactive world requires management data level
Operating system able process input output fro physical computer usually network card sort
This communication network card computer usually managed Network Interface Controller NIC small component handle two physical data link layer

A type cache
Aside obvious various miscellaneous system concept require management may entirely obvious
One cache
Cache component transparently store data future request data served faster
The data stored within cache might value computed earlier duplicate original value stored elsewhere
If requested data contained cache request served simply reading cache comparatively faster
Otherwise data recomputed fetched original storage location comparatively slower
Hence greater number request served cache faster overall system performance becomes
Evaluate resource available variety computer system
An operating system responsible communicating variety device
Usually communication accomplished help device driver small program know way particular device expects receive deliver information
With device driver every operating system longer need know every device might possible expected communicate te fuure
It another beautiful example abstraction

Outline operating system hide complexity hardware user application
Modern computer hardware incredibly complex
Luckily operating system hide complexity use abstraction APIs
For example application want create file particular location order OS create file
The program need concerned filesystem disk running FAT NTFS etc disk whether network server local drive
The OS hide detail
Other example include virtualizing real device drive letter virtual memory input device Java virtual machine

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk

The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

I confused actual role delegate
I asked question many time interview I think interviewer satisfied answer
Can anyone tell best definition one sentence practical example
Thanks Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
I like think delegate pointer function
This go back C day idea still hold
The idea need able invoke piece code piece code going invoke known runtime
So use delegate purpose
Delegates come handy thing like event handler different thing based different event example
reference C look In C example let say calculation wanted wanted use different calculation method know runtime
So might couple calculation method like We could declare delegate signature like And could declare method take delegate parameter like And could call method passing delegate method wanted use
delegate simply function pointer
simply put assign method wish run delegate
later code call method via Invoke
code demonstrate wrote memory syntax may What delegate
When object receives request object either handle request pas request second object work
If object decides pas request say object forwarded responsibility handling request second object
Or easy pseudo example something sends request
forward request delegate
process request work
note link give good example Think delegate simplified implementation Command pattern
A delegate object refer method
Thus create delegate creating object hold reference method
Furthermore method called reference
Thus delegate invoke method refers
The principal advantage delegate allows u specify call method method actually invoked determined runtime compile time
Here I going explain delegate multicast delegate
Delegate type hold method reference object
It also referred type safe function pointer
We say delegate type defines method signature
When instantiate delegate associate instance method compatible signature
You invoke call method delegate instance
Delegates used pas method argument method
Event handler nothing method invoked delegate
Advantages using delegate Encapsulating method call caller Effective use delegate improves performance application Used call method asynchronously
There property delegate public delegate Declaration The following example show delegate operation It delegate hold reference one method
Multicast delegate must contain method return void else exception
Here Delegate added using operator removed using operator
Delegate type derived Delegate class Framework
Delegate type derived
Because instantiated delegate object passed parameter assigned property
This allows method accept delegate parameter call delegate later time
This known asynchronous callback
A great explanation practical implementation Delegate pattern found Google Collections Classes also Decorator pattern
In Event communication sender know object handle event
Delegate type hold reference method
Delegate signature hold reference method match signature Delegate like type safe function pointer
new declared delegate In Events work concept Delegate like Button Click Delegate used know code invoke run time So time Delegate used handle Events A object another object consults something happens object
For instance repair man delegate something happens car
go repair man ask fix car although prefer repair car case delegate car
A delegate object represents pointer function
However ordinary function pointer Is Object Oriented Is type safe
point method read raw memory address pointing Is strongly typed
It point method match signature
Can point one method time
While really function pointer delegate might look like dynamic language like PHP JavaScript could something like A delegate something task delegated
The primary purpose delegation decouple code allow greater flexibility reuse
In programming specifically programming mean method called work pass work method another object reference
The reference could point whatever object wish long object conforms predefined set method
We call programming interface versus programming concrete class implementation
An interface basically generic template implementation simply mean recipe set method precondition postconditions rule
Simple example Now see I use whatever implementation I want time without changing code SomeCaller type passed concrete rather abstract since interface
In Java world often expressed service paradigm call service object advertising service via specific interface service call delegate help work
The service method named task makePayment createNewUser etc
internally lot work delegation delegate type interface instead concrete implementation

How implementation get assigned beyond scope thread
Lookup inversion control dependency injection
Delegates mainly used event
You want execute piece code time run program
After running program want execute piece code whenever event occurs
This say know method invoke compiling time
know runtime clicking button
Without delegate user interface programming possible
Because executing code whenever user make event clicking button typing textbox selecting dropdownlist item asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

Ashley attorney
She taught written various introductory law course
common practice contract law
Delegation occurs party contract
Delegation involve transfer contractual right
Let say hire remodel kitchen
I planning work I painter
Paint fume give headache
I planning delegate painting friend Pam
I still responsible kitchen remodel pay I finished
The contract
Pam responsible painting
An occurs
A party assign entire contract meaning party assigns right obligation contract
Alternatively party assign right benefit due contract
The party making assignment called
The party receiving assignment
It helpful remember assignee step shoe assignor
Delegation hand involves portion contract
With delegation particular contractual task activity transferred
Delegation mean obligation transferred right transferred
The party making delegation called
The party receiving delegation
The delegatee assume responsibility entire contract receive benefit contract
Therefore delegatee step shoe delegator
In scenario I delegator Pam delegatee
In assignment delegation
The obligor original party contract obligated something term contract
In scenario obligor
You obligated pay I finish kitchen
The main difference delegation assignment relates contract right
In assignment right benefit contract assigned another party
If I assign Pam remodel kitchen Pam right collect payment
If refuse pay Pam sue payment
Pam stepped shoe
On hand delegation delegator retains right benefit contract well overall obligation contract
If I delegate duty paint kitchen I still responsible delivering completely remodeled kitchen
I also still right collect payment entire kitchen finished
If refuse pay Pam ca sue never contract
Pam step shoe
I sue payment

Another important difference delegation assignment involves liability
A delegatee liable assignee
A delegatee liable overall performance contract contractual duty accept
Let say I assign entire kitchen contract Pam
Pam responsible completion kitchen remodel
If happen problem sue Pam
Now let say I delegate kitchen painting Pam
Since Pam assumed responsibility duty responsible liable anything painting
If I install wrong color sink Pam liable Pam painting sloppy I sue Pam sue Pam
Either one u recover money necessary work
Sometimes delegation prohibited
Let change scenario little bit
Let say hired remodel kitchen remodel includes one famous stained glass window
I ca delegate task creating window task talent
Additionally assignment delegation prohibited contract clearly address possibility forbids
Let review
common practice contract law
Delegation occurs party contract
Delegation involve transfer contractual right
In right benefit contract assigned another party
In delegation delegator retains right benefit contract
Another important difference involves liability
A delegatee liable overall performance contract contractual duty delegatee accept

At moment I teaching iOS programming one concept I find really hard wrap head around delegation
What
Why used
What advantage
The technical writing book I reading make hard understand
To understand understand
A like service contract
When object often subclass always sign contract saying I interested providing logic back message send
This similar regard signing level interest difference object employ delegation one time multiple object sign
Apple us delegation pervasively
More though seeing Apple move lot API similar language
That said delegation help maintain MVC even though I would argue delegation design pattern
It help separate model controller
Such John Cartwright example know display row section
It know reuse performance reason
It know stuff know
But know cell display
It know populate cell
It know cell reuse given
This really job controller anyways
Delegation allows table view offload logic onto object responsibility anyways
More locked one delegate entire lifetime object
You could easily multiple datasources given switch around run time needed
So one hand delegation great supplying data responding interaction object
You see lot UIKit class etc
But delegation also useful want pas information object
You easily create protocol sign object follow
Furthermore protocol method default specify method
This give nice flexibility need
Let say parent view controller child view controller
Maybe using new Containment API
Typically need pas information parent child property
Done
But need pas information child back parent
Maybe something change child need notify parent
Sure could KVO certain value
But maybe want know button pressed
Simply create new protocol child view controller In MyChildViewController button tapped simply check delegate responds delegate message required delegate implement method crash
You make method need send Then set delegate MyChildViewController implement parent view controller
BOOM
You information passed child parent
The relationship two object even need close
It service contract long object signing hold end bargain implementing required method golden
Delegates property otherwise enter retain cycle neither object deallocated
Hope help
Delegates object implement certain function make sense implement function normal object
It form dependency injection
For concrete example look UITableViewDelegate protocol
These method make sense table view implement directly action selecting table view row different app maybe table view
The delegate method create object handle row selection without subclassing table view every separate action want implement

When consider list term well defined CS despite fact programming language use misuse term example C list
I looking term Computer Science domain defines pointer function C delegate Swift closure
Consider function take another function parameter established term
Functor
I know parochial terminology concept used great variety many sometimes disputable language design available computer science
Some design choice may motivated issue remotely connected science
But also le established terminology
When function take function parameter simply called
A function seen composed control part code instruction environment entity used control
This environment comprises usually two kind program entity local entity normally intended used lifetime call function distict instance distinct call visible entity created declared body function
They come existence function call usually duration call global entity defined declared usually enclosing structure function method class instance containing function declaration hence also visible usable function
They call function value created declaration instance
The function code together associated global environment called
The term year old
But closure essentially functional value
Often conceptual closure structure ignored everything work naturally one would hope since function declared environment usually cease accessible thus used environment exited
Hence longer need using
It however possible functional value leaf environment declared survive disappearance environment us global entity
This happens mostly another function return functional result
If function variable declared function use global
It may happen functional value returned call
This problem functional value stored functional variable would probably say pointer used
The difficulty come fact functional value called may use variable call created terminated returning
So special step must taken preserve closure even call terminated corresponding environment longer otherwise needed
Actually occurs often object oriented programming essentially reason
Object orientation implemented language precisely declaring object constructor function local variable state variable object constructed return tuples functional value method object class accessing variable
Thus closure concept intentional frequent occurrence OO programming
Every method essentially closure environment implementing state object
At call constructor new tuple closure created new object corresponding function code change closed new environment local environment constructor call creates object
As said closure pair composed function globals
It mutable pair essentially fixed function created
However adress pair stored variable
It dereferenced called big mystery
But I know whether call pointer function though I would hope
You may note creation closure nothing caller callee
It function declares closure function return environment globals defined
I experienced double check seem functional type function closure method instance
This typing ensures instance misused might happen untyped pointer function
It clear whether C allows changing closure associated delegate instance
whether delegate instance considered functional variable functional constant
From I read seems former hence comparison function pointer
Why necessary pas function method parameter apparently due specific feature C
Other language need anything special declare parameter like functional type
signature
I suggest read wikipedia article possibly though I read enough detail vouch accuracy

delegation implemented language
delegation requires support delegation pattern
forwarding call delegate instance

take two argument reference class contains property instance class contains metadata
Now whenever refer property get someName
mutable property
easily delegate class implement interface
delegating class contains reference outer instance
Thus allow delegate object use functionality delegating class
The contains several implementation delegated property feature
establish restriction setting value
If callback return true value property set new value callback return false new value discarded property retains previous value

Trying read property initial value assigned result exception
operator allows check property us Delegate providing delegate

occurs someone authority confers upon another person power particular task
Delegation usually street superior delegate authority subordinate
However ultimate responsibility task completion usually remains responsibility person delegated authority complete
For example bos delegate task likely still ultimately responsible making sure task accomplished
No one person many organizational leader hand full full
Delegation basically way organization distribute authority operate level organization top bottom
This dissemination authority known
This principle state must clear line authority running top organization bottom
This line authority often called comprised series relationship superior subordinate arranged vertically allows communication flow chain
So scalar chain important delegation
The scalar chain made use delegation
Let use example illustrate point
You president large manufacturing company
Your job implement strategy policy given board director run operation company span three continent employ people office around world
Get FREE access day create account
Since cloned rely upon others
You therefore authorize vice president handle task relate respective department
They turn delegate part task subordinate delegate part subordinate
You created several scalar chain
Moreover able see delegation involves creating scalar chain also utilizing person delegated specific task
Now let look one final aspect delegation quality leadership
Theorists noted leader us delegation approach three standpoint
First leader delegate authority abdicates responsibility task
Second leader may refuse delegate afraid losing control
Such leader typically fail task accomplish everything without delegation
Finally wise leader delegate necessary completely understands ultimately responsible accomplishing duty office
In word subordinate fails complete task leader ultimately responsible
Let review
important feature effective management
Delegation occurs superior within hierarchy confers authority onto subordinate completion task
A may created series delegation starting top superior working hierarchy organization
An effective leader delegate nearly reached capacity complete task assigned recognizes still ultimately responsible completion task delegate subordinate

A delegate managed secure function pointer framework
A delegate signature includes name return type argument passed
Rather passing data delegate pass method another method
Delegates used many context including implementing callback event handler entry thread point multiple type method specification
Because delegate know class referenced object used anonymous invocation

Metadata data describes data
prefix information technology usage mean underlying definition description
Metadata summarizes basic information data make finding working particular instance data easier
For example example basic document metadata
Having abilty filter metadata make much easier someone locate specific document
In addition document file metadata used image video spreadsheet web page
The use metadata web page important
Metadata web page contain description page content well keywords linked content
These usually expressed form
The metadata containing web page description summary often displayed search result search engine making accuracy detail important since determine whether user decides visit site
Metatags often evaluated search engine help decide web page relevance used key factor determining position search late
The increase search engine optimization towards end led many website keyword stuffing metadata trick search engine making website seem relevant others
Since search engine reduced reliance metatags though still factored indexing page
Many search engine also try halt web page ability thwart system regularly changing criterion ranking Google notorious frequently changing ranking
Metadata created manually automated information processing
Manual creation tends accurate allowing user input information feel relevant needed help describe file
Automated metadata creation much elementary usually displaying information file size file extension file created created file

catalog metadata data data file may entirely distinct source file
In word customer might find read buy retailer Web site purchase required inclusion metadata information information found Web could read understood machine attachment value relationship hyperlink computer could use direct search

information provides information data
Three distinct type metadata exist
Metadata traditionally used library converted catalog data digital database
In digital format becoming prevalent way storing data information metadata also used describe digital data using
There different metadata standard different discipline collection etc
Describing data increase usefulness
For example may include metadata specifying software language page written HTML tool used create subject page find information subject
This metadata automatically improve reader experience make easier user find web page online
A may include metadata providing information musician singer songwriter whose work appears disc
A principal purpose metadata help user find relevant information discover resource
Metadata also help organize electronic resource provide digital identification support archiving preservation resource
Metadata assist user resource discovery allowing resource found relevant criterion identifying resource bringing similar resource together distinguishing dissimilar resource giving location information
Metadata telecommunication activity including traffic widely collected various national governmental organization
This data used purpose used mass
In many country metadata relating email telephone call web page video traffic IP connection cell phone location routinely stored government organization
For example may include metadata describes large picture color depth image resolution image created shutter speed data
A text document metadata may contain information long document author document written short summary document
Metadata within web page also contain description page content well key word linked content
These link often called Metatags used primary factor determining order web search late
The reliance metatags web search decreased late keyword stuffing
Metatags largely misused trick search engine thinking website relevance search really
Metadata stored managed often called
However without context point reference might impossible identify metadata looking
For example database containing several number digit long could result calculation list number plug equation without context number perceived data
But given context database log book collection number may identified information refers book information within book
The term metadata coined Philip Bagley book Extension Programming Language Concepts clear us term ISO traditional sense structural metadata
data container data rather alternate sense content individual instance data content metacontent type data usually found library catalogue
Since field information management information science information technology librarianship widely adopted term
In field word defined data data
While generally accepted definition various discipline adopted specific explanation us term
While metadata application manifold covering large variety field specialized model specify type metadata
Singley distinguish two distinct class metadata guide metadata
describes structure database object table column key index
help human find specific item usually expressed set keywords natural language
According metadata divided similar category technical metadata business metadata
corresponds internal metadata corresponds external metadata
Kimball add third category
On hand NISO distinguishes among three type metadata descriptive structural administrative
typically used discovery identification information search locate object title author subject keywords publisher
describes component object organized
An example structural metadata would page ordered form chapter book
Finally give information help manage source
Administrative metadata refers technical information including file type file created
Two administrative metadata right management metadata preservation metadata
explains intellectual property right contains information preserve save resource
An additional type metadata beginning developed
new concept library however advance universal design raised profile
Projects like GPII identified lack common terminology model describe need preference user information fit need major gap providing universal access solution

Those type information accessibility metadata
incorporated several accessibility property based IMS Global Access All Information Model Data Element Specification
The Wiki page list several property value
While effort describe standardize varied accessibility need information seeker beginning become robust adoption established metadata schema developed
For example Dublin Core DC audience MARC reading level could used identify resource suitable user dyslexia DC Format could used identify resource available braille audio large print format work done
Metadata metacontent correctly vocabulary used assemble metadata metacontent statement typically structured according standardized concept using metadata scheme including
Tools used apply standardization metadata
Structural metadata commonality also paramount importance development
Metadata metacontent syntax refers rule created structure field element metadata metacontent
A single metadata scheme may expressed number different markup programming language requires different syntax
For example Dublin Core may expressed plain text
A common example guide metacontent bibliographic classification subject
There always implied statement classification object
To classify object example Dewey class number Topology
book number spine implied statement book subject heading
This triple importantly triple
The first two element triple class attribute piece structural metadata defined semantic
The third element value preferably controlled vocabulary reference master data
The combination metadata master data element result statement metacontent statement
metacontent metadata master data
All element thought vocabulary
Both metadata master data vocabulary assembled metacontent statement
There many source vocabulary meta master data UML EDIFACT XSD SKOS Pantone Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature etc
Using controlled vocabulary component metacontent statement whether indexing finding endorsed If indexer searcher guided choose term concept relevant document retrieved
This particularly relevant considering search engine internet Google
The process index page match text string using complex algorithm intelligence inferencing occurring illusion thereof
Metadata schema hierarchical nature relationship exist metadata element element nested relationship exist element
An example hierarchical metadata schema schema metadata element may belong parent metadata element
Metadata schema also linear element completely discrete element classified according one dimension
An example linear metadata schema schema one dimensional
Metadata schema often two dimensional planar element completely discrete element classified according two orthogonal dimension
In case metadata schema exceed planar depiction type required enable display view metadata according chosen aspect serve special view
Hypermapping frequently applies layering geographical geological information overlay
The degree data metadata structured referred
Granularity refers much detail provided
Metadata high granularity allows deeper detailed structured information enables greater level International standard apply metadata
Much work accomplished national international standard community especially American National Standards Institute International Organization Standardization reach consensus standardizing metadata registry
The core metadata registry standard Metadata Registries MDR framework standard described
A new edition Part final stage publication early
It revised align current edition Part extends MDR support registration Concept Systems
see
This standard specifies schema recording meaning technical structure data unambiguous usage human computer
standard refers metadata information object data data data
In information object data Data Elements Value Domains reusable semantic representational information object describe meaning technical detail data item
This standard also prescribes detail metadata registry registering administering information object within Metadata Registry
Part also provision describing compound structure derivation data element example calculation collection one data element form derived data
While standard describes originally data element registry purpose support describing registering metadata content independently particular application lending description discovered reused human computer developing new application database analysis data collected accordance registered metadata content
This standard become general basis kind metadata registry reusing extending registration administration portion standard
The Geospatial community tradition specialized standard particularly building tradition catalogue
Formal metadata usually essential geospatial data common approach applicable
The metadata term set vocabulary term used describe resource purpose discovery
The original set classic metadata term known Dublin Core Metadata Element Set endorsed following standard document Although standard also mentioned section approach semantic markup seek existing tag convey metadata
Microformat follows XHTML HTML standard standard
One advocate microformats characterized problem alternative approach Metadata may written file identify owns copyright contact information brand model camera created file along exposure information shutter speed etc
descriptive information keywords photo making file image searchable computer Internet
Some metadata created camera input photographer software downloading computer
Most digital camera write metadata model number shutter speed enable edit functionality available Nikon DSLRs since new Canon camera since Pentax DSLRs since Pentax
Metadata used make organizing easier use
Filters used analyze specific set photograph create selection criterion like rating capture time
Photographic Metadata Standards governed organization develop following standard
They include limited Information time origin destination phone call electronic message instant message mode telecommunication opposed message content another form metadata
Bulk collection metadata intelligence agency proven controversial disclosure Intelligence agency NSA keeping online metadata million internet user year regardless whether person interest agency
Metadata particularly useful video information content transcript conversation text description scene directly understandable computer efficient search content desirable
There two source video metadata derived operational gathered metadata information content produced type equipment software date location metadata improve search engine visibility discoverability audience engagement providing advertising opportunity video publisher
In today society professional video editing software access metadata
Avid MetaSync Adobe Bridge two prime example
Metadata created either automated information processing manual work
Elementary metadata captured computer include information object created created last updated file size file extension
In context refers following Data virtualization emerged new software technology complete virtualization stack enterprise
Metadata used data virtualization server enterprise infrastructure component alongside database application server
Metadata server saved persistent repository describe various enterprise system application
Structural metadata commonality also important support data virtualization
Standardization work large impact effort build metadata system statistical community
Several metadata standard described importance statistical agency discussed
Applications standard Census Bureau Environmental Protection Agency Bureau Labor Statistics Statistics Canada many others described
Emphasis impact metadata registry statistical agency
Metadata used various way mean cataloging item library digital analog format
Such data help classify aggregate identify locate particular book DVD magazine object library might hold collection
Until many library catalogue used inch card file drawer display book title author subject matter abbreviated string indicated physical location book within library shelf
The employed library classification library material subject early example metadata usage
Beginning many library replaced paper file card computer database
These computer database make much easier faster user keyword search
Another form older metadata collection use US Census Bureau known Long Form
The Long Form asks question used create demographic data find pattern distribution
employ metadata commonly part
Metadata obtained resource book periodical DVDs web page digital image
This data stored integrated library management system using metadata standard
The purpose direct patron physical electronic location item area seek well provide description question
More recent specialized instance library metadata include establishment including repository digital image library
While often based library principle focus use especially providing metadata mean follow traditional common cataloging approach
Given custom nature included material metadata field often specially created
taxonomic classification field location field keywords copyright statement
Standard file information file size format usually automatically included
Library operation decade key topic effort toward
Standards metadata digital library include schema
Leading library world give hint metadata standard strategy
Metadata museum context information trained cultural documentation specialist museum create index structure describe identify otherwise specify work art architecture cultural object image
Descriptive metadata commonly used museum context object identification resource recovery purpose
Metadata developed applied within collecting institution museum order Many museum cultural heritage center recognize given diversity art work cultural object single model standard suffices describe catalogue cultural work
For example sculpted Indigenous artifact could classified artwork archaeological artifact Indigenous heritage item
The early stage standardization archiving description cataloging within museum community began late development standard CDWA Spectrum CRM
These standard use markup language machine processing publication implementation

Most collecting institution museum use categorize cultural work image
Relational database metadata work document describe complex relationship amongst cultural object work art well object place people artistic movement
Relational database structure also beneficial within collecting institution museum allow archivist make clear distinction cultural object image unclear distinction could lead confusing inaccurate search
An object materiality function purpose well size measurement height width weight storage requirement environment focus museum collection influence descriptive depth data attributed object cultural documentarians
The established institutional cataloging practice goal expertise cultural documentarians database structure also influence information ascribed cultural object way cultural object categorized
Additionally museum often employ standardized commercial collection management software prescribes limit way archivist describe artwork cultural object
As well collecting institution museum use describe cultural object artwork collection
reputable within museum community recommended CCO standard
Museums encouraged use controlled vocabulary contextual relevant collection enhance functionality digital information system
Controlled Vocabularies beneficial within database provide high level consistency improving resource retrieval
Metadata structure including controlled vocabulary reflect system created
Often process cultural object described categorized metadata museum reflect perspective maker community
Metadata instrumental creation digital information system archive within museum made easier museum publish digital content online
This enabled audience might access cultural object due geographic economic barrier access
In museum adopted archival standard created intricate database discussion museum database come museum archival library science community
Collection Management Systems CMS tool local shared system
scholar note many benefit interoperability museum database collection also acknowledging difficulty achieving interoperability
Problems involving metadata becoming widespread
Courts looked various question involving metadata including metadata party
Although Federal Rules Civil Procedure specified rule electronic document subsequent case law elaborated requirement party reveal metadata
In October ruled metadata record
Document metadata proven particularly important legal environment litigation requested metadata include sensitive information detrimental certain party court
Using clean redact document mitigate risk unwittingly sending sensitive data
This process partially see protects law firm potentially damaging leaking sensitive data
In Australia need strengthen national security resulted introduction new metadata storage law

ANS
Metadata storage Metadata stored either internally file data externally separate file
Metadata embedded content called embedded metadata
A data repository typically store metadata detached data
Both way advantage disadvantage Internal storage allows transferring metadata together data describes thus metadata always hand manipulated easily
This method creates high redundancy allow holding metadata together
External storage allows bundling metadata example database efficient searching
There redundancy metadata transferred simultaneously using streaming
However format use URIs purpose method metadata linked data treated care
What resource URI resource local hard disk web page created using content management system
What metadata evaluated connection Web especially using RDF
How realize resource replaced another name different content
Moreover question data format storing metadata format XML useful user understand edit without specialized tool
On hand format optimized storage capacity may useful store metadata binary format instead speed transfer save memory
Database management Each relational database system mechanism storing metadata
Examples metadata include Tables table database name size number row table
Tables column database table used type data stored column
In database terminology set metadata referred catalog
The SQL standard specifies uniform mean access catalog called database implement even implement aspect SQL standard
For example metadata access method see Oracle metadata What various DBMS schema decision support
Elaborate ANS
A dimensional model look different
In enterprise data warehouse number separate fact table representing different process within organization order inventory shipment return
These separate fact table threaded many common dimension table possible
The surrounding table called dimension table much smaller fact table
Although dimension table several descriptive text field always far fewer row take much le disk space fact table
Each dimension table single part key
The field dimension table typically textual used source constraint row header report
Star join schema support two specific kind query browse multitable join
Browse query operate one dimension table involve join
A typical browse query occurs user asks list brand name product dimension table perhaps subject constraint element dimension table
This query must respond instantly user full attention screen
Multitable join query occur series browse involve constraint placed several dimension table joined fact table simultaneously
The goal fetch hundred possibly thousand underlying record small answer set user grouped together one textual attribute selected dimension table
Even table scan fit second paradigm always kind constraint kind grouping action query
This second kind query rarely instantaneous significant resource required satisfy query
Part B How map DW Multi Processor architecture

ANS
The central data warehouse database cornerstone data warehousing environment
This database almost always implemented relational database management system RDBMS technology
However kind implementation often constrained fact traditional RDBMS product optimized transactional database processing
Certain data warehouse attribute large database size ad hoc query processing need flexible user view creation including aggregate join become driver different technological approach data warehouse database
These approach include Parallel relational database design scalability include shared disk model implemented various multiprocessor configuration symmetric multiprocessor SMP massively parallel processor MPP cluster multiprocessor
An innovative approach speed traditional RDBMS using new index structure bypass relational table scan
Multidimensional database MDDBs based proprietary database technology conversely dimensional data model implemented using familiar RDBMS
database designed overcome limitation placed warehouse nature relational data model
MDDBs enable analytical processing OLAP tool architecturally belong group data warehousing component jointly categorized data query reporting analysis mining tool
What role OLAP data mining
ANS
In large data warehouse environment many different type analysis occur
You enrich data warehouse advance analytics using OLAP Analytic Processing data mining
Rather separate OLAP data mining engine Oracle integrated OLAP data mining capability directly database server
Oracle OLAP Oracle Data Mining ODM option Oracle Database
OLAP data mining used solve different kind analytic problem OLAP provides summary data generates rich calculation
For example OLAP answer question like How sale mutual fund North America quarter compare sale year ago
What predict sale next quarter
What trend measured percent change Data mining discovers hidden pattern data
Data mining operates detail level instead summary level
Data mining answer question like Who likely buy mutual fund next six month characteristic likely buyer OLAP data mining complement
For example OLAP might pinpoint problem sale mutual fund certain region
Data mining could used gain insight behavior individual customer region
Finally data mining predicts something like increase sale OLAP used track net income
Or Data Mining might used identify important attribute concerning sale mutual fund attribute could used design data model OLAP
Draw Star schema diagram Sales database ANS
Consider database sale perhaps store chain classified date store product
fact table three dimension table
Each dimension table primary key PK column relating one column viewed row example schema table compound primary key
The key Units Sold column fact table example represents measure metric used calculation analysis
The key column dimension table represent additional attribute dimension Year dimension
Using schema descriptor combined simple suffix decoration column differentiation make easier write SQL Star Schema query
This fewer underscore required table aliasing SQL database engine allow schema descriptor also permit decoration suffix surrogate key column
Using square bracket physically easier type keyboard shift key needed intrusive make code easier read
For example following query extract many TV set sold brand country Star schema used example query

Part

In part responsible loading
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content containing program instruction memory carrying required preparatory task prepare executable running
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader apart highly specialized computer system fixed set specialized program
typically loader instead code executes directly ROM
In order load operating system part specialized used
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory although operating system support may allow loader located region memory
In case operating system support virtual memory loader may actually copy content executable file memory rather may simply declare virtual memory subsystem mapping region memory allocated contain running program code content associated executable file
See
The virtual memory subsystem made aware page region memory need filled demand program execution actually hit area unfilled memory
This may mean part program code actually copied memory actually used unused code may never loaded memory
In loader
The Unix loader task include In loader function contained following Some operating system need adjust address pointer executable compensate variation address loading start
The operating system need relocating loader program always loaded location address space pointer absolute address rather offset program
Some example IBM mainframe descendant including mainframe
In descendant system privileged operating system facility called IEWFETCH internal component OS Supervisor whereas LOADER application perform many function plus Linkage Editor entirely external OS Supervisor although certainly us many Supervisor service
IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized theoretically possible load relocate entire executable within one revolution DASD medium m maximum m average legacy rpm drive
For load module exceed track size also possible load relocate entire module without losing revolution medium
IEWFETCH also incorporates facility overlay structure facilitates running potentially large executables minimum memory model small KB version OS KB KB common
The OS always resident portion Supervisor formatted way compatible version IEWFETCH
Unlike normal executables OS nucleus scatter loaded part nucleus loaded different portion memory particular certain system table required reside initial KB table code may reside elsewhere
The system application named IEWL
IEWL main function associate load module executable program object module output say assembler compiler including automatic call library language function format may efficiently loaded IEWFETCH
There large number editing option conventional application commonly employed
The load module format includes initial text record followed immediately relocation control record text record followed instance text record relocation control record pair end module
The text record usually large relocation control record small IEWFETCH three relocation control record buffer fixed byte smaller relocation control record certainly possible byte maximum possible IEWL ensures limitation complied inserting additional relocation record required next text record necessary special case sequence record may text record relocation record control record text record
A special byte within relocation control record buffer used disabled bit spin communication area initialized unique value
The Read CCW relocation control record Program Controlled Interrupt bit set
The processor thereby notified CCW accessed channel via special exit
At point processor enters disabled bit spin loop sometimes called shortest loop world
Once byte changed initialized value processor instantaneously know reading relocation control record completed bit spin terminated relocation may proceed synchronously rotation medium relocation occurs gap within medium relocation control record next text record
If relocation text record completed NOP CCW changed TIC loading relocating proceed using next buffer
If channel encounter NOP CCW channel program terminate restarted IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit
The three buffer continuous circular queue pointing next last pointing first three buffer constantly reused loading relocating proceeds
IEWFETCH thereby load relocate load module practical size minimum possible time
another type loader load link like already loaded running program

I wanted know depth meaning working compiler linker loader
With reference language preferably
C preprocessing first step compilation
It handle The purpose unit convert C source file Pure C code file
There Six step unit It combine character source file form TOKEN
A token set character line
Therefore unit compilation also called TOKENIZER
It also remove comment generates symbol table relocation table entry
This unit check syntax code
For ex The code generate parse error equation balanced
This unit check internally generating parser tree follows Therefore unit also called PARSER
This unit check meaning statement
For ex The code generates error Assignment incompatible type
This unit independent CPU two type optimization This unit optimizes code following form For ex Here compiler know value compile time therefore also know condition always true
Hence eliminates else part code
For ex optimized follows For ex In code local used loop optimized follows Code generation Here compiler generates assembly code frequently used variable stored register
Here optimization CPU dependent
Suppose one jump code converted one The control jump directly
Then last phase Linking creates executable library
When executable run library requires Loaded
ASCII representation Hope help little
First go diagram You make piece code save file Source code As name suggests part compilation
They instruct compiler required actual compilation
You call phase Text Substitution interpreting special preprocessor directive denoted
Compilation process program written one language get translated another targeted language
If error compiler detect report
Assemble code get translated machine code
You call assembler special type complier
If piece code need source file linked linker link make executable file
There many process happens
Yes guessed right come role loader It load executable code memory program data stack created register get initialized
Little Extra info see memory layout
Compiler It program translates high level language program machine language program
A compiler intelligent assembler
It check kind limit range error etc
But program run time occupies larger part memory
It slow speed
Because compiler go entire program translates entire program machine code
If compiler run computer produce machine code computer known self compiler resident compiler
On hand compiler run computer produce machine code computer known cross compiler
Linker In high level language built header file library stored
These library predefined contain basic function essential executing program
These function linked library program called Linker
If linker find library function informs compiler compiler generates error
The compiler automatically invokes linker last step compiling program
Not built library also link user defined function user defined library
Usually longer program divided smaller subprogram called module
And module must combined execute program
The process combining module done linker
Loader Loader program load machine code program system memory
In Computing loader part Operating System responsible loading program
It one essential stage process starting program
Because place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content executable file memory
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory
Wikipedia ought good answer thought It read source file may type etc translates file called object file
It combine several file may generated multiple source file executable file ELF format GCC
There two type linking A program load executable file primary memory machine
For study three stage program execution Linux please
LinuxJournal explains concept clarity
It also explains classic name came
assembler output A quick summary got executable give file friend customer need software run software say typing command line Once program loaded memory control transferred program making PC program counter pointing first instruction Operating System An operating system OS system software manages computer hardware software resource provides common service computer program
The operating system component system software computer system
Application program usually require operating system function
Compiler A compiler computer program set program transforms source code written programming language source language another computer language target language latter often binary form known object code
Interpreter interpreter computer program directly executes
performs instruction written programming scripting language without previously compiling machine language program
Assembler An assembler program take basic computer instruction convert pattern bit computer processor use perform basic operation
Loader loader part operating system responsible loading program library
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Linker linker program combine object module form executable program
Preproccesor Preproccesor text substitution tool instructs compiler required actual compilation
compiler change check source code error change object code operating system run
You often write whole program single file linker link object code file
program wont get executed unless main memory A compiler software program compiles program source code file executable program
It included part integrated development environment IDE programming software package
The compiler take source code file written language C BASIC Java compiles code language machine code assembly code
This code created specific processor type Intel Pentium PowerPC
The program recognized processor run operating system
Loader An operating system utility copy program storage device main memory executed
In addition copying program main memory loader also replace virtual address physical address
Most loader transparent directly execute operating system us necessary
Linker Is program adjusts two program segment may simultaneously loaded executed unit Also called link editor binder linker program combine object module form executable program
Many programming language allow write different piece code called module separately
This simplifies programming task break large program small manageable piece
Eventually though need put module together
This job linker
A compiler special program process statement written particular programming language turn machine language code computer processor us translates line code programming language machine language
creates link two program
load program memory main database program etc
Compiler system software correct error program object file message etc Linker system software combine One objectfiles possible library code either exicutable library list error Loader A program load executable file primary memory machine By posting answer agree

I keep seeing bootstrapping mentioned discussion application development
It seems widespread important I yet come across even poor explanation bootstrapping actually rather seems though everyone supposed know mean
I though
Near I figure something initialization task required application upon launch I could completely wrong
Can anyone help understand idea
Bootstrapping come term pulling bootstrap
That much get
In computing bootstrap loader first piece code run machine start responsible loading rest operating system
In modern computer stored ROM I recall bootstrap process would poke bit via switch load particular disk segment memory run
Needless say bootstrap loader normally pretty small
Bootstrapping also used term building system using correctly predecessor version
For example version written using parser developed ANTLR version
An example bootstrapping web framework
You call bootstrapper load framework helper model configuration load controller pass control
As see simple file start large process
See Wikipedia article
There section link explaining mean
It four different us field
Here quote depth explanation alternative meaning consult link
technique simple computer program activates complicated system program
A different use term bootstrapping use compiler compile first writing small part compiler new programming language existing language compile program new compiler written new language
In context application development bootstrapping usually come talking modular software
Rather user downloading entire app including feature need manually updating whenever update user downloads start small bootstrap executable turn downloads installs part application user need
Additionally bootstrap component able look update install time started
For completeness also rather important relatively new method statistic us resampling simulation infer population property sample
It lengthy
Alex pretty much computer boot
computer actually come word bootstrapping Initially small program BIOS run
That contains enough machine code load run larger complex program
That second program probably something like NTLDR Windows LILO Linux executes able load run rest operating system
Boot strapping dictionary meaning start minimum resource
In Context OS OS able swiftly load Power On Self Test POST determines safe wake CPU
The boot strap code run BIOS
BIOS small sized ROM
Generally jump instruction set instruction load Operating system RAM
The destination Jump Boot sector Hard Disk
Once bios program check valid Boot sector contains starting address stored OS ie whether valid MBR Master Boot Record
If valid MBR OS copied memory RAM OS take care Memory Process management
Forget link wikipedia section D Computing Main article Booting The computer term bootstrap began metaphor
In computer pressing bootstrap button caused hardwired program read bootstrap program input unit execute bootstrap program read program instruction became process proceeded without external help manually entered instruction
As computing term bootstrap used since least
The bootstrap concept used IBM computer load button initiated reading first word punched card card reader magnetic tape unit drum unit predecessor hard disk drive
The left executed instruction read additional word memory
IMHO better explanation fact These day Operating System loading common process referred Bootstrapping In term regard using popular Twitter Bootstrap I feel like type bootstrapping action integrating modular component Web application without Web application even acknowledge modular component exists need reference
The developer seamlessly integrate default copy CSS Twitter Bootstrap theme simply loading referencing Web application
Vuola
Then may need override change way untouched completely reusable
This concept Web Devs implement jQuery APIs really expressed Devs bootstrapping per se
What improves flexibility reusability allowing isolation different app reside freely either possibly CDN
NOTE In computing bootstrapping deal MBR UNIX requires special bootloader manager small program ROM load OS RAM
If think concept take place action bootstrap loader checking MBR loading OS based table occurs without OS idea take place
As humble beginner world programming flicking answer seeing word used lot apparently slightly different way different place I found reading Wikipedia page Bootstrapping duh
I think either first informative understand use word
Could extremely rare occasion Wikipedia might even better explanation certain term redacted
Will bring rep point Wikipedia though
To seems meaning something start something simple possible make something slightly complex use kind task efficiently quickly could originally
Then repeat Thing ad infinitum
I see closely connected biological evolution Abstraction newbie like see ahem Wikipedia cough evolution computer switch machine code Assembly C Python AIs give kind complex instruction like make dinner default requirement clean floor drunken slang English Amazon tribal dialect without exception newbie guessed missed lot link due simple ignorance
Then certain specific software meaning used load latest version course bigger bigger
lower level language closer print Hello used write little bit higher language little bit used expand baby vocabulary level towards adult vocabulary level start processed use correct technical term baby version clever baby
whereas baby version could course compiled cause ca exist exists right duh
child version compiles Surly Teenager version point programming community decides whether Surly Teenager software term metaphor term
worth spending enough time resolving accepted long term abandon sure take analogy
If yes possibly time babyhood adulthood child father man Wordsworth suggest try looking quote author Stack Overflow
I tell AngularJS application part fit together
One file tell application
The term bootstrapping usually applies situation system depends start sort chicken egg problem
For instance In case bootstrapping refers way breaking circular dependency usually help external entity
etc
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

The pattern widely used approach describing structure information processing program process
Many introductory programming system analysis text introduce basic structure describing process
A sort process using model receives input user source computation input return result computation
In essence system separate environment thus defining input output one united mechanism
The system would divide work two category In word input may material human resource money information transformed output consumables service new information money
As consequence system becomes vulnerable misinterpretation
This theoretically contains data regard environment outside system yet practice environment contains significant variety object system unable comprehend exists outside system control
As result important understand boundary lie system environment beyond system understanding
This often various analyst would set boundary favouring point view thus creating much confusion
The view differ regard system thinking
One definition would outline system structure would Systems thinking art science making reliable inference behaviour developing increasingly deep understanding understanding underlying structure Alternatively also suggested system sense bonding remote object example trying connect crab ozone layer capital life cycle together
There five major category cited information system literature A system created result human interference
Examples would solar system well human body evolving current form A system created result human interference physically identifiable
Examples would various computing machine created human mind specific purpose
A system created result human interference physically identifiable
Examples would mathematical philosophical system created human mind specific purpose
There also social system allow human collectively achieve specific purpose
A system created human derived intangible purpose
For example family hierarchy human relationship essence create boundary natural human system
An organisation hierarchy created human specific purpose
For example company organises human together collaborate achieve specific purpose
The result system physically identifiable
There however significant link previous type
It clear idea human activity system HAS would consist variety smaller social system unique development organisation
Moreover arguably HASes include designed system computer machinery
Majority previous system would overlap
There several key characteristic come fundamental behaviour system

IPO often called IPOS input process output storage
Storage data kept computer turned
An example IPO given toaster input slice bread process heating output toast
A simple computer IPO example pressing key keyboard input process making word output displaying word symbol printing

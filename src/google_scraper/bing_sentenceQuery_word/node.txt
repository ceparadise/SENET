When defining node internet node anything
Nodes individual part larger data structure
Nodes contain also may link node
Links node often implemented
Nodes often arranged tree structure
These structure
A node represents information contained single structure
These node may contain value condition possibly serve another independent data structure
Nodes represented single parent node
The highest point tree structure called root node parent node serf parent node tree
The height node determined total number edge path node furthest leaf node height tree equal height root node
Node depth determined distance particular node root node
The root node said depth zero
Data discovered along network path
An IP address us kind system node define location network
Another common use node tree
In programming used communicate information computer programmer computer alike
For reason XML used create common used serf base development modern web like
Though similar approached programmer typically language used develop website text design
While XML HTML XHTML provide language expression serf translator
Different type node tree represented specific interface
In word node type defined communicates node
Each node node type property specifies type node sibling leaf
For example node type property constant property node property specifies type node
So node type property constant node one know node object object Element
This object us Element interface define method property particular node
Node Types Different node type description A node object represented single node tree
It element node attribute node text node type described section node type
All object inherit property method dealing parent child node object parent child node
For example text node child node similar node add child node result error
Objects DOM tree may addressed manipulated using method object
The public interface DOM specified API
The history Document Object Model intertwined history late well first widely implemented

A tree hierarchical data structure
Generally tree consists value together pointer tree
For example could see class definition like Here child array pointer also hold value
At point child array empty make tree child base case recursive definition tree
When draw pointer line look like tree hence name
Here root node A
The child list A pointer B C Then child list C contains H I example The child list leaf node empty called leaf node see tree top
As might imagine tree useful representing hierarchy object
They also useful maintaining set number collection number subdivided smaller range hierarchically
A tree abstract data type node consists one element number upper bound tree node one one parent except root parent
The consequence two may equal ie content equivalent ca exactly one path node therefore loop
Since I specify rather arc tree I imply unidirectional flow specify
Really come thing tree defined parent therefore far tree concerned nothing go reverse direction
There formal abstract data type notation define tree general specific tree
These give form set notation lambda calculus formal version
It useful use formal notation eliminate ambiguity provide mean testing implementation ensure terminology consistent work across language
A plain English description good enough though
A different approach start graph collection node node point arbitrary number node arc may circular restrict spanning tree graph one path given point arc unidirectional
It produce different abstract form form start readily generalized
Finding effect two distinct ADTs always easy
In A tree information structure capable apparatus arranging information object taking account key
It valuable sorting different information object regarding various leveled connection think family tree youngster assembled guardian tree
The binary tree essential information structure utilized part software engineering
The binary tree valuable information structure quickly putting away sorted information quickly recovering put away information
A binary tree made guardian hub leaf store information furthermore connection two youngster hub leaf envisioned spatially beneath first hub one set one side one set one side
It relationship leaf connected connecting leaf otherwise called guardian hub make binary tree effective information structure
It leaf left lesser key worth quality used hunt leaf tree leaf right equivalent noteworthy key quality
Thus leaf distant left tree least value though leaf privilege tree best value
All vitally every leaf join two different abandon start another littler binary tree
Because nature conceivable effortlessly get embed information binary tree utilizing look embed work recursively approached progressive take

A node point within network
In environment device accessible network device considered node
The concept node work several level view defines node major center Internet traffic typically routed
This usage somewhat confusing Internet node also referred Internet hub
The idea node popularized adoption theory concept distributed network
In context node gateway could receive store send information along different route distributed network
Each node given equal standing within network meaning loss one node significantly hurt network
When applied office personal network however node simply one device performs particular function
As loss node usually mean loss function inability use printer

I trying find max number node tree defined follows The root child
Each subtree left L child
Each subtree right R child
I know formula finding number node binary tree n n amount level tree
Anyone better math help figure
As I understand looking formula maximal number node
Let n number level child root
Assume smaller trivial
On left node L child L child L child long leaf L L second tier
So left node
It easy calculate using information
n L Similarly node right
And include root receive formula

I saw reference creating REPL
What REPL
It difficult tell asked
This question ambiguous vague incomplete overly broad rhetorical reasonably answered current form
For help clarifying question reopened
Good information tag right Stack Overflow About A Loop REPL interactive interpreter programming language
It originated LISP system many language Python Ruby Haskell Tcl etc
use REPL manage interactive session
They allow simple experimentation language bypassing compile stage code compile execute cycle
There component REPL named LISP notation The first Google hit give definition Wikipedia REPL stand A loop REPL simple interactive computer programming environment
In short start interactive console type command immediately see result command
If supported language REPL interactive way code command execution

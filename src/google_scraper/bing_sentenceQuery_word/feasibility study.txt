Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction Feasibility Study Technical Feasibility It technically possible design script remarking system computer used sort search update data input using database management system Microsoft Access
The current hardware United Kingdom Awarding Body sufficient need run system computer preferably RAM hard disk drive floppy disk drive higher graphic card standard keyboard mouse printer visual display unit run system effectively efficiently
Economic Feasibility It economically feasible design use script remarking system fewer people would need employed work remarking script producing report manually work done shorter time span therefore also saving overhead light heating well employee wage Legal Feasibility It legally feasible use script remarking system data used used specific purpose remarking candidate script nothing else
The data kept longer necessary candidate request data may destroyed certain period time
The data also secure administrator clerical staff need group name password log system successfully also system database password without data accessed
Middle Clerical staff using remark system need input data required via form using keyboard mouse
This automatically update query place update report
The report outputted using printer
Design Validation Designs user interface Test Reason Input Expected Output Actual Output Comment Reference Page Check Candidate Name Olivio Del Piero Olivio Del Piero Olivio Del Piero Allows name inputted centre number candidate number subject reference different Feroz Fran Error message Error message Does allow name inputted centre number subject reference Sealan O Shea Sealan O Shea Sealan O Shea Allows name inputted subject reference different centre number

Also difficulty producing suitable formula calculate original grade original mark mark grade
After consultation tutor solution found following formula devised IIF Expression True False
Afterwards grading formula designed follows Grades IIf A A IIf B B IIf C C IIf D D IIf E E U
A grading formula also considered implemented follows IIf A A IIf B B IIf C C IIf D D IIf E E U
Effectiveness The system paper produce report paper candidate information inputted via candidate information input form
Usability The system easy user use interface button open file form simplistic design attractive use
Maintainability The system easy maintain simplicity easy manipulate accommodate new request different type information without changing system run excessively
Maintenance Perfective maintenance For perfective maintenance admin staff change query create report get desired result

changing query requested selected centre report show different centre
Adaptive maintenance For adaptive maintenance staff could use new hardware help reduce clerical error
Staff could use OCR MCR scanner read script information instead inputting manually therefore reducing human error

I working project website
Our mentor told submit design report feasibility report SRS
As first time know
make report include
I need help
Please tell SRS design report feasibility report
What write
I absolutely idea SRS I never come across term sound like mentor web background general engineering background
Design report I would consider basis information architecture producing wireframes early stuff conceptualises website future appearance reasoning design choice usability consideration
As feasibility report best guess would going research analysis competitor website site offer comparable service trying justify potential website would improve existing model
Perhaps I totally mentor want As I really know exactly assignment hopefully helpful I would speak mentor clarification SRS Software Requirements Specification
Tommy true seems strange website
That kind SRS exactly relevant project get port hardware requirement going making spot
Could right though computer science course building project web based
An website could well contain interactive application rather static page
In case software development job need requirement spec
But I guessing
Tommy true seems strange website
That kind SRS exactly relevant project get port hardware requirement going making spot
Could right though computer science course building project web based
yes computer engineering student project mentioned
Well I would probably ask tutor mean
Certainly SRS computer science document really relative web design I know web designer developer make use
I would want advise wrongly methodology
Well know abbreviation SRS contact mentor mean
That get paid
I assume SRS secure report two party
You likely given scenario brief explains assignment first place I see crystal ball
Well I cloudy
It likely set scenario leader small team geek process trying acquire contract building website
What type would require
hardware server software predicted project time cost associated
I suspect asked similar Systems Analysis
A Feasibility Study evaluation proposal designed determine difficulty carrying designated task
Generally feasibility study precedes technical development project implementation
In term Input Processes Output Fields Programs Procedures
This quantified term volume data trend frequency updating etc
order estimate whether new system perform adequately mean feasibility study based outline

Before planning project must ask question Can project successful
If answer project commence
If slight possibility project success also unlikely project go ahead
Some question ask order consider whether project successful include In order answer critical question project feasibility study must conducted
The document containing detailed description project followed set different feasibility area
These aspect project drive success failure project
This study provide necessary information decide whether project begin whether shot success
The project feasibility study start basic detail project provide purpose goal project
A project description must include detailed description project scope project
Also included information regarding stakeholder vested interest project impacted project
The description project contain relatively detailed timeline task breakdown including done
It also important detail end result project
What project produce create company
Does anybody want product service
Will anybody use
Is similar currently available prevent project success
If project assumes customer pay use must ensure market exists
Where necessary must identify pricing model ensure similar currently available lower price
If continue project investing time money resource nobody pay service project failure
Get FREE access day create account
Is even possible create
Do necessary expertise technical resource
Does project rely party product already exist
For example project scope requires fridge talk walk project unfeasible since walking talking fridge exist
Assuming course walking talking fridge outside scope current project
Also considered logistical geographical requirement project
For example need resource foreign country need bigger building
You determined project technically feasible market product service
The next question project prohibitively expensive
That sufficient budget project
You need conduct primary investigation expensive project may
Sample question include A budget essential order determine project feasibility
Who manage work scheduled task
Project feasibility requires matching skillsets individual order ensure correct expertise order actually project
This may introduce project feature example outsourcing brings additional operational overhead
Project feasibility also
For example project requires continuing management completed resource must available
A project never started unless confidence successful
Project failure risk project obvious failure avoided work done front order identify possibility probability success
Creating document containing detailed description project followed set different feasibility area assist significantly reducing risk project failure long provides accurate information
Here quick recap step covered You going follow step ask question regularly
Ask project feasible every step answer yes
If stage project becomes unfeasible barrier entry expensive market impossible maintain unlikely project continue
It important note decision taken alone
All project stakeholder must reach consensus move forward cancel project

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Project Documentation available

THE education site computer science ICT A Systems Life Cycle term
For project feasibility study examine realistic proposed solution meet aim project
It also compare contrast option put forward complete project
It examine issue cost manpower timescale
At end feasibility study recommendation best way forward study may even recommend canceling project feasible

computer program derived branch computer science research called AI
scientific goal understand intelligence building computer program exhibit intelligent behavior
It concerned concept method symbolic inference reasoning computer knowledge used make inference represented inside machine
Of course term cover many cognitive skill including ability solve problem learn understand language AI address
But progress date AI made area problem solving concept method building program problem rather calculate solution
AI program achieve competence solving problem task area bringing bear body knowledge specific task called
Often term expert system reserved program whose knowledge base contains knowledge used human expert contrast knowledge gathered textbook
More often two term expert system ES system KBS used synonymously
Taken together represent widespread type AI application
The area human intellectual endeavor captured expert system called
refers activity
refers area within task performed
Typical task diagnosis planning scheduling configuration design
An example task domain aircraft crew scheduling discussed Chapter
Building expert system known practitioner called
The knowledge engineer must make sure computer knowledge needed solve problem
The knowledge engineer must choose one form represent required knowledge symbol pattern memory computer must choose
He must also ensure computer use knowledge efficiently selecting handful
The practice knowledge engineering described later
We first describe component expert system
Every expert system consists two principal part knowledge base reasoning inference engine
The expert system contains factual heuristic knowledge
knowledge task domain widely shared typically found textbook journal commonly agreed upon knowledgeable particular field
le rigorous experiential judgmental knowledge performance
In contrast factual knowledge heuristic knowledge rarely discussed largely individualistic
It knowledge good practice good judgment plausible reasoning field
It knowledge underlies art good guessing
formalizes organizes knowledge
One widely used representation simply
A rule consists IF part THEN part also called
The IF part list set condition logical combination
The piece knowledge represented production rule relevant line reasoning developed IF part rule satisfied consequently THEN part concluded action taken
Expert system whose knowledge represented rule form called
Another widely used representation called also known based upon passive view knowledge
The unit assemblage associated symbolic knowledge entity represented
Typically unit consists list property entity associated value property
Since every task domain consists many entity stand various relation property also used specify relation value property name unit linked according relation
One unit also represent knowledge special case another unit unit part another unit
The organizes control step taken solve problem
One common powerful paradigm involves chaining rule form line reasoning
If chaining start set condition move toward conclusion method called
If conclusion known example goal achieved path conclusion known reasoning backwards called method
These method built program module called manipulate use knowledge knowledge base form line reasoning
The expert us learned school colleague year experience
Presumably experience larger store knowledge
Knowledge allows interpret information database advantage diagnosis design analysis
Though expert system consists primarily knowledge base inference engine couple feature worth mentioning reasoning uncertainty explanation line reasoning
Knowledge almost always incomplete uncertain
To deal uncertain knowledge rule may associated weight
The set method using uncertain knowledge combination uncertain data reasoning process called
An important subclass method reasoning uncertainty called fuzzy logic system use known fuzzy system
Because expert system us uncertain heuristic knowledge human credibility often question case human
When answer problem questionable tend want know rationale
If rationale seems plausible tend believe answer
So expert system
Most expert system ability answer question form Why answer X
Explanations generated tracing line reasoning used inference engine Feigenbaum McCorduck et al

The important ingredient expert system knowledge
The power expert system resides specific knowledge contain task domain
AI researcher continue explore add current repertoire knowledge representation reasoning method
But knowledge resides power
Because importance knowledge expert system current knowledge acquisition method slow tedious much future expert system depends breaking knowledge acquisition bottleneck codifying representing large knowledge infrastructure
art designing building expert system knowledge engineer practitioner
Gerald Weinberg said programming like single word encompasses infinitude activity Weinberg
Knowledge engineering perhaps
We stated earlier knowledge engineering applied part science artificial intelligence turn part computer science
Theoretically knowledge engineer computer scientist know design implement program incorporate artificial intelligence technique
The nature knowledge engineering changing however new breed knowledge engineer emerging
We discus evolving nature knowledge engineering later
Today two way build expert system
They built scratch built using piece development software known tool shell
Before discus tool briefly discus knowledge engineer
Though different style method knowledge engineering exist basic approach knowledge engineer interview observes human expert group expert learns expert know reason knowledge
The engineer translates knowledge language design inference engine reasoning structure us knowledge appropriately
He also determines integrate use uncertain knowledge reasoning process kind explanation would useful end user
Next inference engine facility representing knowledge explaining programmed domain knowledge entered program piece piece
It may inference engine right form knowledge representation awkward kind knowledge needed task expert might decide piece knowledge wrong
All discovered modified expert system gradually gain competence
The discovery cumulation technique machine reasoning knowledge representation generally work artificial intelligence research
The discovery cumulation knowledge task domain province domain expert
Domain knowledge consists formal textbook knowledge experiential knowledge expert
Compared wide variation domain knowledge small number AI method known useful expert system
That currently handful way represent knowledge make inference generate explanation
Thus system built contain useful method without knowledge
Such system known simply
Building expert system using shell offer significant advantage
A system built perform unique task entering shell necessary knowledge task domain
The inference engine applies knowledge task hand built shell
If program complicated expert training use shell expert enter knowledge
Many commercial shell available today ranging size shell PCs shell workstation shell large mainframe computer

They range shell shell class task financial planning process control
Although shell simplify programming general help knowledge acquisition
refers task endowing expert system knowledge task currently performed knowledge engineer
The choice reasoning method shell important important accumulation knowledge
The power expert system lie store knowledge task domain knowledge system given competent becomes
The fundamental working hypothesis AI intelligent behavior precisely described symbol manipulation modeled symbol processing capability computer
In late special programming language invented facilitate symbol manipulation
The prominent called LISP LISt Processing
Because simple elegance flexibility AI research program written LISP commercial application moved away LISP
In early another AI programming language invented France
It called PROLOG PROgramming LOGic
LISP root one area mathematics lambda calculus PROLOG another predicate calculus
PROLOG consists statement fact assertion rule inference question
Here inference rule If
Programs written PROLOG behavior similar system written LISP
PROLOG however immediately become language choice AI programmer
In early given impetus announcement Japanese would use logic programming language Fifth Generation Computing Systems FGCS Project
A variety programming language since arisen term become generic

In computer system emulates ability human expert
Expert system designed solve complex problem body knowledge represented mainly rather conventional
The first expert system created proliferated
Expert system among first truly successful form AI software
An expert system divided two subsystem
The knowledge base represents fact rule
The inference engine applies rule known fact deduce new fact
Inference engine also include explanation debugging ability
Expert system introduced Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led sometimes termed father expert system key early contributor Bruce Buchanan Randall Davis
The Stanford researcher tried identify domain expertise highly valued complex diagnosing infectious disease identifying unknown organic molecule
The idea intelligent system derive power knowledge posse rather specific formalism inference scheme use Feigenbaum said time significant step forward since past research focused heuristic computational method culminating attempt develop problem solver foremostly conjunct work
Expert system became first truly successful form AI software
Research expert system also active France
While US focus tended system first system hard coded top programming environment expert system shell developed vendor France research focused system developed
The advantage expert system shell somewhat easier nonprogrammers use
The advantage Prolog environment focused rule Prolog environment provided much fuller realization complete environment
In expert system proliferated
Universities offered expert system course two third company applied technology daily business activity
Interest international Japan increased research funding Europe
In first operating system introduced
The imbalance high affordability relatively powerful chip PC compared much expensive cost processing power mainframe dominated corporate IT world time created new type architecture corporate computing termed
Calculations reasoning could performed fraction price mainframe using PC
This model also enabled business unit bypass corporate IT department directly build application
As result client server tremendous impact expert system market
Expert system already outlier much business world requiring new skill many IT department eager develop
They natural fit new shell promised put application development hand end user expert
Until main development environment expert system high end
With rise PC client server computing vendor Intellicorp Inference Corporation shifted priority developing PC based tool
Also new vendor often financed Aion Corporation Exsys many others started appearing regularly
The first expert system used design capacity product SID Synthesis Integral Design software program developed
Written SID generated CPU logic gate
Input software set rule created several expert logic designer
SID expanded rule generated software routine many time size rule
Surprisingly combination rule resulted overall design exceeded capability expert many case human counterpart
While rule contradicted others control parameter speed area provided
The program highly controversial used nevertheless due project budget constraint
It terminated logic designer VAX project completion
In beyond term idea standalone AI system mostly dropped IT lexicon
There two interpretation
One expert system failed IT world moved expert system deliver hyped promise
The mirror opposite expert system simply victim success IT professional grasped concept rule engine tool migrated standalone tool developing special purpose system one many standard tool
Many leading major business application suite vendor integrated expert system ability suite product way specifying business logic rule engine longer simply defining rule expert would use type complex volatile critical business logic often go hand hand business process automation integration environment
An expert system example
Expert system first commercial system use architecture
A system essentially composed two
The knowledge base represents fact world
In early expert system Mycin Dendral fact represented mainly flat assertion variable
In later expert system developed commercial shell knowledge base took structure used concept programming
The world represented class subclass instance assertion replaced value object instance
The rule worked querying asserting value object
The inference engine evaluates current state applies relevant rule asserts new knowledge knowledge base
The inference engine may also include ability explanation explain user chain reasoning used arrive particular conclusion tracing back firing rule resulted assertion
There mainly two mode inference engine
The different approach dictated whether inference engine driven antecedent left hand side consequent right hand side rule
In forward chaining antecedent fire asserts consequent
For example consider following rule A simple example forward chaining would assert Man Socrates system trigger inference engine
It would match assert Mortal Socrates knowledge base
Backward chaining bit le straight forward
In backward chaining system look possible conclusion work backward see might true
So system trying determine Mortal Socrates true would find query knowledge base see Man Socrates true
One early innovation expert system shell integrate inference engine user interface
This could especially powerful backward chaining
If system need know particular fact simply generate input screen ask user information known
So example could use ask user Socrates Man use new information accordingly
The use rule explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation ability
In simple example system used assert Socrates Mortal user wished understand Socrates mortal could query system system would look back rule fired cause assertion present rule user explanation
In English user asked Why Socrates Mortal
system would reply Because men mortal Socrates man
A significant area research generation explanation knowledge base natural English rather simply showing formal le intuitive rule
As expert system evolved many new technique incorporated various type inference engine
Some important The goal system make critical information required system work explicit rather implicit
In traditional computer program logic embedded code typically reviewed IT specialist
With expert system goal specify rule format intuitive easily understood reviewed even edited domain expert rather IT expert
The benefit explicit knowledge representation rapid development ease maintenance
Ease maintenance obvious benefit
This achieved two way
First removing need write conventional code many normal problem caused even small change system could avoided expert system
Essentially logical flow program least highest level simply given system simply invoke inference engine
This also reason second benefit
With expert system shell possible enter rule prototype developed day rather month year typically associated complex IT project
A claim expert system shell often made removed need trained programmer expert could develop system
In reality seldom ever true
While rule expert system comprehensible typical computer code still formal syntax misplaced comma character could cause havoc computer language
Also expert system moved prototype lab deployment business world issue integration maintenance became far critical
Inevitably demand integrate take advantage large legacy database system arose
To accomplish integration required skill type system
The common disadvantage cited expert system academic literature problem
Obtaining time domain expert software application always difficult expert system especially difficult expert definition highly valued constant demand organization
As result problem great deal research later year expert system focused tool knowledge acquisition help automate process designing debugging maintaining rule defined expert
However looking expert system actual use problem essentially problem large system seem least critical knowledge acquisition integration access large database performance
Performance especially problematic early expert system built using tool Lisp executed interpreted rather compiled code
Interpreting provided extremely powerful development environment drawback virtually impossible match efficiency fastest compiled language
System database integration difficult early expert system tool mostly language platform neither familiar welcome corporate IT environment programming language Lisp Prolog hardware platform personal computer
As result much effort later stage expert system tool development focused integrating legacy environment large database system porting standard platform
These issue resolved mainly paradigm shift PCs gradually accepted IT environment legitimate platform serious business system development affordable server provided processing power needed AI application

A expert system maintains separation part system executes rule often referred
The system shell indifferent rule executes
This important distinction mean expert system shell applied many different problem domain little change
It also mean adding modifying rule expert system effect change program behavior without affecting controlling component system shell
The language used express rule closely related language use describe problem solution
When subject matter expert composes rule using language time creating written record problem knowledge shared others
Thus creation rule kill two bird one stone rule add functionality change program behavior record essential information problem domain form
Knowledge captured maintained system ensures continuity operation even subject matter expert mathematician accountant physician retire transfer
Furthermore change made easily subject matter expert without programmer intervention thereby reducing cost software maintenance helping ensure change made way intended
Rules added subject matter expert using text graphical editor integral system shell
The simple process rule added depicted Figure
An expert system typically composed two major component Expert System Shell
The collection rule encoded file system often relational database
The Expert System Shell component housing facility creating editing executing rule
A software architecture expert system illustrated Figure
The shell portion includes software module whose purpose The Client Interface process request service application layer component
Client Interface logic route request appropriate shell program unit
For example subject matter expert wish create edit rule use Client Interface dispatch
Other service request might schedule rule group rule execution Rule Engine
The Editor simple text editor graphical editor hybrid two type
It provides facility enable subject matter expert compose add rule
Rules composed subject matter expert directly executable
They must first converted form form interpreted Rule Engine
Converting rule one form another function performed Rule Translator
The translation rule original form form requires parsing textual representation obtain data structure referred Abstract Syntax Tree AST
The AST representation rule data structure guide execution inference engine come time apply rule
The AST designed make Rule Engine simple efficient
This abstract data type expressive permit construction complex powerful rule
There third form rule may expressed
A rule AST converted equivalent form suitable storage
The way information appears depends storage technology
Relational database provide especially convenient efficient mean storing metadata
The metadata corresponding AST case would reside collection table
The specific scheme chosen saving metadata must permit ASTs rapidly reconstructed using database query
The diagram Figure summarizes several conversion operation Rule Translator must perform add rule retrieves rule execution
To make idea concrete consider arithmetic expression might form part rule
In AST representation portion rule would expressed binary tree like one Figure whose node either arithmetic operator operand
Once created AST representation converted rule metadata stored
Rule metadata simply compact representation ASTs
The role Rule Translator rule editing process illustrated data flow diagram Figure
In translating rule one form another structure original rule never lost
It always possible recreate rule exactly representation AST representation
The Rule Engine often referred AI literature responsible executing rule
It retrieves rule convert ASTs provides rule interpreter execution
The Rule Engine interpreter traverse AST executing action specified rule along way
This process depicted Figure
The shell component Rule Object Classes container object class supporting The construction expert system le challenging one might think given almost magical power attributed class program
The task made easier The design construction expert system involves four major step depicted Figure
The surest way make certain expert system design rule language easy user learn easy use
The language must serve need subject matter expert
Subject matter expert need language mimic way speak think operate
Its lexical element syntax rule must make resulting language appear similar spoken language possible
These goal must balanced need create language recognized translator created conventional
Rules must expressed using simple free idiosyncrasy
Every sentence language used express rule must precise unvarying meaning
A natural language inherent ambiguity difficult translate
This natural language word single meaning word meaning precise
In natural language meaning word phrase colored context
Machine translation natural language possible program logic required complex expensive wholly reliable
Machine translation natural language relies largely heuristic make translation imperfect
On hand language made appear
However programmer know language unforgiving spelling grammar error
Fortunately method translation language rooted mature mathematics
make construction straightforward reliable
The tool used generate translator language require precise language definition
These language definition called
A sample grammar defining hypothetical rule language appears Figure
The grammar defines language
The grammar extending across line rule end defines structure rule
This production read produce keyword rule followed something called followed something called followed keyword followed something called followed something called followed keyword end followed something called
A simple meaningless rule conforming hypothetical grammar appears Figure
This rule might interpreted mean value expression assigned object E appearing side equal sign
The rule composed subject matter expert must translated stored executed
Rules transformed form Rule Translator
The Rule Translator generated automatically lexical specification rule grammar
Lexical specification define lexical unit reserved word numerical value operator etc expert system rule language
The rule grammar defines syntax semantics language
Figure illustrates method Rule Translator automatically generated
The depicted diagram operates definition language lexical unit produce software component referred
The scanner read convert rule text form sequence lexical unit called
Each token sequence logically related character special meaning
For example text A stitch time save might decomposed lexical analyzer designed use grammarian linguist token sequence article noun preposition noun verb noun period These token stream used rule parser structure rule larger meaningful unit called control statement assignment statement etc
perform creation AST element required construct
The produce two software component Rule Parser collection semantic action subprogram
The Rule Parser receives token stream Scanner
It structure token meaningful unit control statement assignment statement etc
The parser invokes semantic action creation AST element appropriate construct discovers
Semantic action software unit dispatched parser recognizes language construct rule
These semantic action build Abstract Syntax Trees ASTs discussed previous section
The Expert Systems Rule Editor provides mean subject matter expert compose rule
Some people prefer graphical editor
Graphical editor expressive power needed precisely specify complex rule however difficult build might well end unwieldy subject matter expert use
Text editor simple use rather easy build
The disadvantage text editor unforgiving spelling syntax error
This fact force subject matter expert understand rule syntax simple though might
To relieve subject matter expert burden speed development rule editor could equipped special aid
These might include editing feature menu checkboxes radio button help facility
Rather build text editor scratch commercially available editor similar could purchased substituted editor
The Rule Engine properly rule
Execution rule involves performing step diagrammed Figure
Rule may include The retrieval rule metadata construction AST operation corresponding step depicted Figure could performed single reference hypothetical method within Rule Object Classes component The method might query element rule identified input parameter assemble element attributed AST defining rule
To illustrate consider assignment statement E x z appearing sample rule
For sake simplicity assume purpose rule assign value side assignment statement
Somewhere rule attribute value variable x z recorded
The defining information term x z well symbol referenced rule kept symbol table connected rule AST
If information needed assign value x z kept database database query would generated dynamically Rule Engine obtain value variable
The information needed query drawn rule symbol table
Suppose query return value x z respectively
The Rule Engine prepared evaluate rule AST case look something like binary tree Figure The evaluation assignment operator right expression subtree performed using method described algorithm shown Figure
The three diagram Figure trace execution expression evaluation algorithm attempt show machination algorithm work evaluate arithmetic expression
Finally Rule Engine move value side expression destination variable What afterward depends rule written
The object last exercise eliminate anxiety developer might feel demonstrating simplicity scheme rule executed
Rules executed magic
We simply apply variety programming technique familiar trained computer scientist
An automatic code generation tool building lexical analyzer Generates language translator grammar

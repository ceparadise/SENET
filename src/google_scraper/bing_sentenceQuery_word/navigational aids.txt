For hundred year mariner lacking chronometer used method lunar distance determine Greenwich time find longitude
A mariner chronometer could check reading using lunar determination Greenwich time
In navigation rhumb line loxodrome line crossing meridian longitude angle
path derived defined initial bearing
That upon taking initial bearing one proceeds along bearing without changing direction measured relative true magnetic north
Most modern navigation relies primarily position determined electronically receiver collecting information satellite
Most modern technique rely crossing LOP
A line position refer two different thing either line chart line observer object real life
A bearing measure direction object
If navigator measure direction real life angle drawn navigator line chart
In addition bearing navigator also often measure distance object
On chart distance produce circle arc position
Circles arc hyperbolae position often referred line position
If navigator draw two line position intersect must position
A intersection two LOPs
If one line position available may evaluated position establish estimated position
Lines circle position derived variety source There method seldom used today dipping light calculate geographic range observer lighthouse Methods navigation changed history
Each new method enhanced mariner ability complete voyage
One important judgment navigator must make best method use
Some type navigation depicted table
The practice navigation usually involves combination different method
By mental navigation check pilot navigator estimate track distance altitude help avoid gross navigation error
Piloting also called pilotage involves navigating aircraft visual reference landmark water vessel restricted water fixing position precisely possible frequent interval
More phase navigation proper preparation attention detail important
Procedures vary vessel vessel military commercial private vessel
A military navigation team nearly always consist several people
A military navigator might bearing taker stationed gyro repeater bridge wing taking simultaneous bearing civilian navigator must often take plot
While military navigator bearing book someone record entry fix civilian navigator simply pilot bearing chart taken record
If ship equipped ECDIS reasonable navigator simply monitor progress ship along chosen track visually ensuring ship proceeding desired checking compass sounder indicator occasionally
If aboard often case restricted water judgement generally relied upon easing workload
But ECDIS fail navigator rely skill manual procedure

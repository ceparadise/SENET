A provides little computer function language map closely processor instruction
Generally refers either
The word low refers small nonexistent amount language machine language language sometimes described close hardware
Programs written language tend relatively mainly close relationship language specific hardware architecture
language convert machine code without compiler use simpler processor called resulting code run directly processor
A program written language made run quickly small
An equivalent program le efficient use memory
language simple considered difficult use due numerous technical detail programmer must remember
By comparison isolates execution semantics computer architecture specification program simplifies development
programming language sometimes divided two category
language computer process directly without previous transformation
Currently programmer almost never write program directly machine code requires attention numerous detail language handle automatically
Furthermore requires memorizing looking numerical code every instruction extremely difficult modify
True stream raw usually data
A programmer coding machine code normally code instruction data readable form translated internal format program called toggled computer memory
Although program written machine language programmer often become adept reading working debugging front panel
Example A function hexadecimal representation machine code calculate th language provide one abstraction level top machine code
In early day coding computer like first thing MIT hacker write assembler
little formal specification mapping symbol including symbolic address numeric constant
Typically one represented one line assembly code
Assemblers produce object file
Most assembler provide generate common sequence instruction
Example The calculator assembly language using syntax In code example hardware feature processor named manipulated directly
The function load input precise location byte higher location stored stack pointer performs calculation manipulating value register finished return
Note assembly language concept returning value
The result stored register command simply move code processing code location stored stack usually instruction immediately one called function author calling code know function store result retrieve
assembly language imposes standard returning value function fact concept function calling code examine state procedure return need extract value
Compare function C This code similar structure assembly language example significant difference term abstraction These abstraction make C code compilable without modification architecture C compiler written
The assembly language code specific architecture
In late language extended included degree access programming function
One method assembly code embedded language support feature
Some language also allow adjust way compiler us target processor architecture

typically term used classify describe point specific systematic operation though us also vary depending context use computer science versus business administration
In general used describe operation nature overall goal systemic feature typically concerned wider macro system whole
Alternatively description one describes specific individual component systematic operation focusing detail rudimentary micro function rather macro complex process
classification typically concerned individual component within system operate
Due nature description often completely different low level one
For example feature feature individual feature human known descriptive individual feature feature individual feature human personality feature body
The description differ depending level studied
Features emerge high level description known

A language programming language deal computer hardware component constraint
It minute level abstraction reference computer work manage computer operational semantics
A language may also referred computer native language
language designed operate handle entire hardware instruction set architecture computer directly
language considered closer computer
In word prime function operate manage manipulate computing hardware component
Programs application written language directly executable computing hardware without interpretation translation
Machine language assembly language popular example language

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
Translators usually included within programming convert
Translators
assembler translates assembly language machine code
language written mnemonic closely reflects operation
An interpreter CPU instruction interpreter move translate next instruction
Interpreted code show error soon hit problem easier code
An interpreter create independent final set source code created time run
Interpreted code slower execute compiled code
Interpreted language include JavaScript PHP Python Ruby
Interpreted language also called language
These ideal using within web application
They used coding small program executed within
A compiler
It difficult test individual line compiled code compared interpreted language reported program compiled
The saved stored separately code
Compilation slow machine code executed quickly
Java compiled programming language
Java programming language compiled produce interpreted
Bytecode code compiled interpreted

submitted What difference programming language
I actually know program Java Python C idea difference
Also really mean
EDIT sentence structure Post comment
It relative part
The original meaning high level language language portable different machine structure later compiled specific architecture like C v pure assembly example C high level language
Nowadays applies language user managed memory like C provide runtime guarantee necessary embedded system critical application v garbage collected language like java even higher level interpreted language like python
That make lot sense thanks
This answer match classification I encountering lately opposed distant language machine code
The general definition would simply expressive power course relative task hand
Low level mean closer machine code assembly
The higher get layer abstraction programmer system Low level machine language CPU actually work
It corresponds directly logical operation performed silicon loading value register reading value memory jumping particular location memory etc
If look Assembly language look like really tough make sense operation granular
All High level language somehow converted low level operation
Back day straightforward case either compiling code one hit machine language interpreter convert high level code line line
These day tends bit complicated
For instance Java converted bytecode sort low level language run virtual machine interprets actual machine language
And usually simple
The high level look like actual language
A high level language allow stuff le code make abstraction technicality
Low level language allow fine tune underlying detail program
Low level basically mean language feature almost analogous feature provided hardware running
So super low level language like assembly would telling processor push certain bit onto stack etc whereas high level language might correspond directly machine instruction
For example could kinda consider Wolfram Alpha high level language tell want instead describing every step take get
The higher language le need tell computer
Generally trade away use high level language fine grained control computer generally performance

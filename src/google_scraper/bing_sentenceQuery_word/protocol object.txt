In common mean unrelated communicate
These definition value object agree upon order
For example protocol termed interface specifies method implementing class must implement
This mean separate sorting method example sort object implement Comparable interface without know anything inner nature class except two object compared mean
The protocol description If object fully protocol describe way object may accessed object
Some provide explicit language support protocol interface
In interface known abstract base class implemented using
The feature also support interface
Although generally considered language allow method defined type
Go interface type compatible type support given set method type need explicitly implement interface
The empty interface compatible type
Note language concept also called protocol whose meaning subtly different
specification allowed message emphasis message
This difference due somewhat different assumption functional programming programming paradigm
In particular following also considered part protocol language language like used many thing protocol used

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

A protocol system rule define something done
In terminology protocol usually standardized method transmitting establishing communication different device
Just two human need common language begin share idea information must computer common way sending information
The often used example successful system implementation key quality protocol error correction message formatting utilized respected across wide variety
To demonstrate common usage popular protocol examine Internet TCP protocol
Computers communicate different type information text picture Voice Over Internet Protocol
To indicate user want page website connects sends information GET
The server know request divided three section space know value expect section
The first section specifies type request case GET request
The next section location request case file located directory
The final section transport protocol browser would like use case version HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
If Firefox request property different order say GET section end instead beginning web server would able understand request
The order type request defined suite protocol
In previous example saw one protocol used specify use another protocol HTTP
This example protocol interact
TCP IP protocol used establishing basic connection two computer
However simply connecting nothing practical information must actually transferred
Just like protocol defines property connection protocol HTTP defines property data transfer
In addition familiar HTTP protocol common Internet protocol include FTP File Transfer Protocol DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Post Office Protocol version IMAP Internet Message Access Protocol
You probably noticed acronym end letter P
In fact whenever encountered unfamiliar acronym end P good chance defines protocol
Programming Science Software Technology Terminology Questions day

What SOAP
XML SOAP language allows program running one operating system communicate another program another operating system internet
A group vendor Microsoft IBM Lotus others created protocol let activate application object within application across Internet
SOAP codifies practice using XML HTTP invoke method across network computer platform
With distributed computing web application request application come one computer client transmitted Internet another computer server
There many way SOAP make easy using HTTP already standard web format
Web application SOAP really come
When view web page using web browser query view web page
With SOAP would use computer client application query server run program
You ca standard web page HTML
Right might use online banking access bank account
My bank following option While bank three application mostly separate
So I go banking section I ca transfer fund saving account credit card I ca view account balance I online bill paying section
One reason three function separated reside different machine
Ie
program run online bill paying one one computer server credit card bill paying application server
With SOAP matter
You might get account balance called
With standard web based application method available program call server
Using SOAP access method across Internet via HTTP XML
There many possible application SOAP couple One thing consider looking implementing SOAP business server many way thing SOAP
But number one benefit gain using SOAP simplicity
SOAP XML HTTP combined send receive message Internet
It constrained application language Java C Perl platform Windows UNIX Mac make much versatile solution
There error
Please try
Thank signing

In entity manipulated command
With later introduction word object refers particular instance In domain object usually taken mean compilation attribute object element behavior method entity
In way whilst simple data still single piece information complicated type multiple piece information specific property attribute
Instead merely assigned value like int object
In real world gun let say Colt object physical property function would individually specified
Once property Colt object specified form let call endlessly copied create identical object look function way
As alternative example animal primate primate superclass human
Individuals Joe Bloggs John Doe would particular example human class consequently posse characteristic human class primate animal superclass well
Objects foundation fundamental
These language provide extensive support object handling including hierarchical special notation declaring calling method facility selected field client programmer
However object programming implemented language
Objects proven helpful particularly large program
For one thing way implement physically bringing together data component procedure manipulate
More importantly make possible handle disparate object piece long proper method
They also arguably improve program reliability simplify management division work programmer team
programming language generally designed exploit enforce potential advantage object model
The modern concept object approach programming introduced programming language originally released popularized released two year later became standard tool trade spread originally released
In pure approach data field object accessed method
This rule make easy guarantee data always remain valid state
Some language make distinction data member method
Syntactically almost programming language dot
operator placed object symbolic method name used call particular object
For example consider arithmetic class named
This class contains function like add subtract multiply divide process result two number given
This class could used find product firstly creating object class invoking multiply method follows In language object created class object called class
If object type two object class would
Creating instance class sometimes referred class
A example object would dog instance called dog class animal
In case object detail type selectively ignored example dog object could used function looking animal
So could cat belongs class animal
While accessed animal member attribute dog cat would remain unavailable tail attribute animal tail
A object therefore serve purpose
In language would mark memory occupied object free although would still contain object data overwritten
Three property characterize object Some term specialized kind object include The definition object entity distinct identity state behavior principle carried realm
A number extension basic concept object proposed share common characteristic Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon assumption object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The seen distributed data object framework therefore validly seen Object Oriented Framework
It also quite valid use UML diagram express Semantic Web graph
Both Semantic Web Object Oriented Programming Furthering also introduces provide find Object Oriented Programming Object Oriented Databases form Object Identifiers
In instance
Objects abstraction
They hold data way manipulate data
The data usually visible outside object
It changed using mechanism usually called
Suppose bank account bank account current balance also thing done
These field however directly accessible
There method like
Most application object change object interface
Banks usually impose
Suppose dollar account
If client special agreement bank take money account withdraw maximum dollar
He might agreement bank borrow money bank pay fee
In case might able withdraw dollar dollar
So withdraw method lot check described
The account manager might see account differently might method set maximum amount taken account set fee interest rate customer pay money borrowed
As object instance class certain thing class
It perhaps compared object class
Two apple one red bigger green smaller
On hand It easy compare different object
A green apple much common steel wrench

Basically Laplace transform convert function domain function another domain without changing value function
We use Laplace transform convert equation complex differential equation relatively simple equation polynomial
Since equation polynomial easier solve employ Laplace transform make calculation easier
We use Laplace transform derivative convert multiple domain variable
Thus Laplace transform nth degree differential equation transformed nth degree polynomial
One easily solve polynomial get result change differential equation using inverse Laplace transform
A simple Laplace Transform conducted sending signal communication medium stereo radio set cellular phone
When information sent medium cellular phone first converted wave medium
In way information propagates
Now receiving end decipher information sent medium time function converted frequency function
This simple real life application Laplace Transform
Laplace transform several application almost Engineering discipline
Laplace transform used simplify calculation system modelling large differential equation used
In electrical circuit Laplace transform used analysis linear system
Laplace transform widely used Electronics engineer quickly solve differential equation occurring analysis electronic circuit
One imagine solving DSP Digital Signal processing problem without employing Laplace transform
In order get true form radioactive decay Laplace transform used
It make studying analytic part Nuclear Physics possible
Laplace transforms critical process control
It help analyze variable altered produce desired manipulation result
For example study heat experiment Laplace transform used find extent given input altered changing temperature hence one alter temperature get desired output
This efficient easier way control process guided differential equation

In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

Efficient important optimizing use algorithm algorithm require input data sorted list also often useful data producing output
More formally output must satisfy two condition Further data often taken allows rather list allows though often algorithm applied suitable modification either type data
From beginning computing sorting problem attracted great deal research perhaps due complexity solving efficiently despite simple familiar statement
Among author early sorting algorithm around née Snyder worked
analyzed early
Comparison sorting algorithm fundamental requirement Ω log comparison input sequence require multiple log comparison algorithm based comparison better performance
Although many consider sorting solved optimal algorithm known since new algorithm still invented widely used dating first published
Sorting algorithm prevalent introductory class abundance algorithm problem provides gentle introduction variety core algorithm concept analysis
Sorting algorithm often classified Stable sort algorithm sort identical element order appear input
When sorting kind data part data examined determining sort order
For example card sorting example right card sorted rank suit ignored
This allows possibility multiple different correctly sorted version original list
Stable sorting algorithm choose one according following rule two item compare equal like two card relative order preserved one came input also come output
More formally data sorted represented record tuple value part data used sorting called
In card example card represented record rank suit key rank
A sorting algorithm stable whenever two record R S key R appears S original list R always appear S sorted list
When equal element indistinguishable integer generally data entire element key stability issue
Stability also issue key different
Unstable sorting algorithm specially implemented stable
One way artificially extend key comparison comparison two object otherwise equal key decided using order entry original input list
Remembering order however may require additional time space
One application stable sorting algorithm sorting list using primary secondary key
For example suppose wish sort hand card suit order club diamond heart spade within suit card sorted rank
This done first sorting card rank using sort stable sort suit Within suit stable sort preserve ordering rank already done
This idea extended number key leveraged
The effect achieved unstable sort using lexicographic key comparison compare first suit compare rank suit
In table number record sorted
The column Average Worst give case assumption length key constant therefore comparison swap needed operation proceed constant time
Memory denotes amount auxiliary storage needed beyond used list assumption
The run time memory requirement listed understood inside hence base logarithm matter notation mean
These perform better average worst case
The following table describes algorithm sorting algorithm
As limited lower bound
Complexities assume item sorted key size digit size range number sorted
Many based assumption key size large enough entry unique key value hence mean much le
In model algorithm running time radix sort still take time proportional limited larger number element sort would require bigger order store memory
used parallelize sort efficiently distributing data several bucket passing sorting several processor need merge bucket already sorted
Some algorithm slow compared discussed unbounded run time run time
These sort usually described educational purpose order demonstrate run time algorithm estimated
The following table describes sorting algorithm impractical use traditional software context due extremely poor performance specialized hardware requirement
Theoretical computer scientist detailed sorting algorithm provide better O log time complexity assuming additional constraint including While large number sorting algorithm practical implementation algorithm predominate
Insertion sort widely used small data set large data set asymptotically efficient sort used primarily heap sort merge sort quicksort
Efficient implementation generally use combining asymptotically efficient algorithm overall sort insertion sort small list bottom recursion
Highly tuned implementation use sophisticated variant merge sort insertion sort additional logic used Android Java Python quicksort heap sort used variant form implementation
For restricted data number fixed interval counting sort radix sort widely used
Bubble sort variant rarely used practice commonly found teaching theoretical discussion
When physically sorting object alphabetizing paper test book people intuitively generally use insertion sort small set
For larger set people often first bucket initial letter multiple bucketing allows practical sorting large set
Often space relatively cheap spreading object floor large area operation expensive particularly moving object large distance locality reference important
Merge sort also practical physical object particularly two hand used one list merge algorithm heap sort quick sort poorly suited human use
Other algorithm variant insertion sort leaf space also practical physical use
Two simplest sort insertion sort selection sort efficient small data due low overhead efficient large data
Insertion sort generally faster selection sort practice due fewer comparison good performance data thus preferred practice selection sort us fewer writes thus used write performance limiting factor
simple sorting algorithm relatively efficient small list mostly sorted list often used part sophisticated algorithm
It work taking element list one one inserting correct position new sorted list
In array new list remaining element share array space insertion expensive requiring shifting following element one
see variant insertion sort efficient larger list

It complexity making inefficient large list generally performs worse similar
Selection sort noted simplicity also performance advantage complicated algorithm certain situation
The algorithm find minimum value swap value first position repeat step remainder list
It swap thus useful swapping expensive
Practical general sorting algorithm almost always based algorithm average time complexity generally complexity O log common heap sort merge sort quicksort
Each advantage drawback significant simple implementation merge sort us O additional space simple implementation quicksort O complexity
These problem solved ameliorated cost complex algorithm
While algorithm asymptotically efficient random data practical efficiency data various modification used
First overhead algorithm becomes significant smaller data often hybrid algorithm used commonly switching insertion sort data small enough
Second algorithm often perform poorly already sorted data almost sorted data common data sorted O time appropriate algorithm
Finally may also stability often desirable property sort
Thus sophisticated algorithm often employed based merge sort based quicksort falling back heap sort
take advantage ease merging already sorted list new sorted list
It start comparing every two element swapping first come second
It merges resulting list two list four merges list four last two list merged final sorted list
Of algorithm described first scale well large list running time O log
It also easily applied list array requires sequential access random access
However additional O space complexity involves large number copy simple implementation
Merge sort seen relatively recent surge popularity practical implementation due use sophisticated algorithm used standard sort routine programming language
Merge sort standard routine among others used Java least since
much efficient version
It also work determining largest smallest element list placing end beginning list continuing rest list accomplishes task efficiently using data structure called special type
Once data list made heap root node guaranteed largest smallest element
When removed placed end list heap rearranged largest element remaining move root
Using heap finding next largest element take O log time instead O linear scan simple selection sort
This allows Heapsort run O log time also worst case complexity
relies operation partition array element called selected
All element smaller pivot moved greater element moved
This done efficiently linear time
The lesser greater sublists recursively sorted
This yield average time complexity O log low overhead thus popular algorithm
Efficient implementation quicksort partitioning typically unstable sort somewhat complex among fastest sorting algorithm practice
Together modest O log space usage quicksort one popular sorting algorithm available many standard programming library
The important caveat quicksort performance O rare naive implementation choosing first last element pivot occurs sorted data common case
The complex issue quicksort thus choosing good pivot element consistently poor choice pivot result drastically slower O performance good choice pivot yield O log performance asymptotically optimal
For example step chosen pivot algorithm work O log
Finding median however O operation unsorted list therefore exacts significant overhead sorting
In practice choosing random pivot almost certainly yield O log performance
Bubble sort variant simple highly inefficient sort
They thus frequently seen introductory text theoretical interest due ease analysis rarely used practice primarily recreational interest
Some variant Shell sort open question behavior
simple sorting algorithm
The algorithm start beginning data set
It compare first two element first greater second swap
It continues pair adjacent element end data set
It start first two element repeating swap occurred last pas
This algorithm average time performance O rarely used sort large unordered data set
Bubble sort used sort small number item asymptotic inefficiency high penalty
Bubble sort also used efficiently list length nearly sorted element significantly place
For example number element place one position
bubble sort exchange get order first pas second pas find element order sort take time
invented
It improves upon bubble sort insertion sort moving order element one position time
The concept behind Shellsort algorithm perform O k time k greatest distance two element
This mean generally perform O data mostly sorted element place perform faster
So first sorting element far away progressively shrinking gap element sort final sort computes much faster
One implementation described arranging data sequence array sorting column array using insertion sort
The time complexity Shell sort largely depends gap sequence used range O O log
Also unlike efficient sorting algorithm Shellsort require use making useful memory premium
relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed Wlodzimierz Dobosiewicz
It later rediscovered popularized Stephen Lacey Richard Box article published April
Comb sort improves
The basic idea eliminate small value near end list since bubble sort slow sorting tremendously
large value around beginning list pose problem bubble sort refers sorting algorithm data distributed input multiple intermediate structure gathered placed output
For example distribution based sorting algorithm
Distribution sorting algorithm used single processor individual subset separately sorted different processor combined
This allows data large fit single computer memory
Counting sort applicable input known belong particular set possibility
The algorithm run O time O memory length input
It work creating integer array size using th bin count occurrence th member input
Each input counted incrementing value corresponding bin
Afterward counting array looped arrange input order
This sorting algorithm often used need reasonably small algorithm efficient extremely fast demonstrates great asymptotic behavior increase
It also modified provide stable behavior
Bucket sort sorting algorithm generalizes partitioning array finite number bucket
Each bucket sorted individually either using different sorting algorithm recursively applying bucket sorting algorithm
A bucket sort work best element data set evenly distributed across bucket
algorithm sort number processing individual digit
number consisting digit sorted O time
Radix sort process digit number either starting LSD starting MSD
The LSD algorithm first sort list least significant digit preserving relative order using stable sort
Then sort next digit least significant significant ending sorted list
While LSD radix sort requires use stable sort MSD radix sort algorithm unless stable sorting desired
MSD radix sort stable
It common algorithm used internally radix sort
A sorting approach using small bin improves performance radix sort significantly
When size array sorted approach exceeds available primary memory much slower disk swap space must employed memory usage pattern sorting algorithm becomes important algorithm might fairly efficient array fit easily RAM may become impractical
In scenario total number comparison becomes relatively le important number time section memory must copied swapped disk dominate performance characteristic algorithm
Thus number pass localization comparison important raw number comparison since comparison nearby element one another happen speed caching even speed compared disk speed virtually instantaneous
For example popular recursive algorithm provides quite reasonable performance adequate RAM due recursive way copy portion array becomes much le practical array fit RAM may cause number slow copy move operation disk
In scenario another algorithm may preferable even requires total comparison
One way work around problem work well complex record sorted relatively small key field create index array sort index rather entire array
A sorted version entire array produced one pas reading index often even unnecessary sorted index adequate
Because index much smaller entire array may fit easily memory entire array would effectively eliminating problem
This procedure sometimes called tag sort
Another technique overcoming problem using example one way combine two algorithm way take advantage strength improve overall performance
For instance array might subdivided chunk size fit RAM content chunk sorted using efficient algorithm result merged using merge similar used
This faster performing either mergesort quicksort entire list
Techniques also combined
For sorting large set data vastly exceed system memory even index may need sorted using algorithm combination algorithm designed perform reasonably reduce amount swapping required
Related problem include sorting smallest element list alternatively computing smallest element unordered computing th smallest element
These solved inefficiently total sort efficient algorithm exist often derived generalizing sorting algorithm
The notable example related
Conversely sorting algorithm derived repeated application selection algorithm quicksort quickselect seen pivoting move differing whether one recurses side quicksort one side quickselect
A kind opposite sorting algorithm
These fundamentally different require source random number
Interestingly shuffling also implemented sorting algorithm namely random sort assigning random number element list sorting based random number
This generally done practice however simple efficient algorithm shuffling
Sorting algorithm also given parallel computer
These algorithm run single instruction stream multiple data stream computer
Habermann parallel glory induction principle sort k element using k processor k step

Putting data order difficult time consuming
Sorting algorithm bubble sort bucket sort help
It important understand different might best used different situation
For example sometimes algorithm work particular set instance one algorithm much quicker efficient another
One main advantage simple algorithm describe computer
There really one task perform compare two value needed swap
This make small simple computer
The biggest problem bubble sort take long time run
For example value sort pas list take comparison might repeat time
One main advantage quicker run bubble sort
Putting data small bucket sorted individually reduces number comparison need carried
The biggest problem bucket sort algorithm bit complicated bubble sort describe computer
It might easy decide sort number group list name
Should bucket letter alphabet perhaps one bucket X Y Z name many
There lot lot different sorting algorithm

The integral type number bit representation
An integral type bit encode number example unsigned type typically represents value
Other encoding integer value bit pattern sometimes used example printed character code
There four binary computing system
The common allows signed integral type bit represent number

Many language also type specified number bit usually constrained le maximum width type represent integer specified range
Some language support integer also known
Other language support concept construct may library available represent large number using array smaller variable Java class package
These use much computer memory necessary store number however computer finite amount storage represent finite subset mathematical integer
These scheme support large number example one kilobyte memory could used store number decimal digit long
A type type represent two value usually identified respectively
This type stored memory using single bit often given full byte convenience addressing speed access

The term initially meant smallest addressable unit memory

Sorting searching two commonly used operation computer science
For AP exam required know certain method sorting collection called well certain way searching given item collection called
There many common algorithm used sorting collection
Here important one know Selection sort iterative sort algorithm us search swap approach sort collection
For pas collection algorithm find smallest element sorted swap first unsorted element collection
The algorithm continues manner finding next smallest element collection swapping next unsorted element
Finally two unsorted element remain compared necessary swapped sort complete
The efficiency selection sort algorithm number comparison made depend initial order element collection number comparison made regardless initial order
For collection element collection sorted pass
After th pas first element sorted placed final sorted position
In th pas comparison made
The total number comparison made sort complete
The selection sort algorithm efficiency best average worst case
In word best worst case selection sort every case considered average
Insertion sort also iterative sort algorithm
When using algorithm first element sorted respect
The algorithm take second element compare first inserting front first one necessary
From point forward algorithm take next unsorted element compare sorted element inserting element correct position needed
The algorithm continues manner shifting sorted element needed make room next element inserted
The efficiency insertion sort algorithm number comparison made depend initial order element collection
For array element array sorted pass
The efficiency differs best average worst case
Mergesort recursive algorithm us divide conquer approach sorting collection
Each time algorithm called algorithm check see one element collection collection broken two half
If even number element half equal odd number element left half contain one element right half
At point algorithm us recursion calling first mergesort left half collection mergesort right half
When algorithm call mergesort one half break half two half call sort half
This process repeated entire collection broken individual element subcollections length
When method call sort one initial test see one element subcollection fails since one element subcollection
This recursion stop algorithm return sorting half comparing two adjacent element sorting recombining sorted subcollection
This process continues individual element sorted recombined sorted subcollections
Then subcollections compared sorted recombined
This process continues subcollections recombined form two sorted half
Finally left right half compared sorted recombined create final fully sorted collection
Here pseudocode representation mergesort algorithm The efficiency mergesort affected initial ordering element
Because mergesort requires use temporary collection large collection sorted used limited memory space available
This algorithm consists multiple part Remember division collection subcollections merging part algorithm must called
This make mergesort algorithm efficiency log best average worst case
In word best worst case every case considered average
Quicksort average fastest sorting algorithm sorting collection large number element
Quicksort recursive also us divide conquer approach sorting
This algorithm start partitioning collection selecting pivot point usually either first element collection element selected random moving element le pivot point value left pivot point element greater equal pivot point value right pivot point
The algorithm us recursion splitting array two half calling quicksort half
Finally sort complete every element moved correct location
Here pseudocode representation quicksort algorithm Involves going element collection appropriate value found
This often implemented using simple loop begin index count last index collection
This simplest search method becomes le effective collection large
Involves going collection comparing middle index value
This requires sorted collection order work
For Example You trying find number array integer value equal
Notice array sorted smallest value left largest right
You would compare middle value search value
Since would exclude value since also greater search value
You would check search value since new middle
Once value larger search term number excluded
This process continues finally arrive center value

Sorting critical many task
I point characteristic kind thing use sorting
Given set million data record remove merge duplicate
If data record sorted main uniqueness criterion removing duplicate done easily traversing list finding group consecutive record compare equal using criterion
Compare two large set item find differ
try hand
Here two list number Can tell number list missing list
Pretty difficult huh
And number
Now try
Here two list sorted order difficult go list parallel pick difference
The true computer program
Using notation comparing every element one list every element another list O operation whereas comparing sorted list O n operation
That mean cost comparing unsorted list grows square number element whereas cost comparing sorted list grows linearly
Think mean consider list million element
The formula apply Example
Using list Example find number appears list
For unsorted list look every element either find reach end list
On average list element take comparison find thing searching comparison exist
However sorted list use binary search look middle element keep looking first half list le keep looking second half list keep dividing list half find nothing left
Using binary search guaranteed find answer fail comparison comparison max list element
Next time use paper dictionary consider hard would use word sorted alphabetically
Of course order get performance benefit pay cost sorting list typically though sorting algorithm faster certain kind data
However common build list often without change
In case pay cost sorting occasionally get benefit
I think I call I never write sorting algorithm

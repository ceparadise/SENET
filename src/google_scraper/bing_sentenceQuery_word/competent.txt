Computers integral part daily life
The personal computer Internet made computer available almost everyone
There two important part computer
One computer monitor keyboard printer
The second part software written series instruction called computer program
A computer run without instruction
give background learn programming computing skill prepare second area
Most job computer science area require significant knowledge proficiency mathematics
Other trait thinking logically persistence enjoying exacting analytical work
Computer Science exciting continually changing field
This mean continually updating skill knowledge
Employers looking graduate technically competent computer science good communication skill work well team
Computer Science offered College Arts Sciences
Most required computer class require programming assignment project using language JAVA UNIX C
All variety company large small looking employee computer skill
Computing skill combined interest area business natural social science math statistic
The main type company hire computer science graduate include software manufacture hardware manufacturer telecommunication oil gas retail health research transportation accounting government education electrical many others

Liz Bacon Lachlan MacKinnon With growth IT job beating recession continued report skill shortage UK industry yet computer science graduate reported
The IT telecom industry employ one workforce predicted grow nearly five time faster UK average according half million new entrant required
Nine firm suffering IT telecom related shortage delaying development new product service report add
The growing demand student around world UK qualification evidence UK university offer high level technical skill knowledge
Recent international comparison ranked teaching research UK university among best qualification comparison body NARIC rank UK qualification highest quality band worldwide
Yet many employer complain graduate taught skill want many large employer admit recruiting elite Russell Group university
How picture compare rest world
The USA also report increasing demand coupled skill shortage IT sector repeated across EU Canada Australia
By contrast much developing world employer willing invest qualification staff one reason significant demand UK postgraduate degree amongst international student
So many recent UK computer science graduate unemployed
Input based recent report commissioned investigated data produced Higher Education Statistics Agency HESA cite number interrelated factor affecting unemployment
Some factor obvious quality degree obtained location within UK institution study one key factor employment rate black minority ethnic BME student
Computer science forefront widening access agenda far higher proportion BME student studying traditional science engineering subject
This also influence balance student number university Russell Group institution BME student opposed Russell Group university BME
BME graduate higher unemployment rate across subject even BME computer science student Russell Group institution unemployment rate compared average Russell Group unemployment rate
However need clear many student come still live area extremely high unemployment figure would heralded significant success story
It argued consideration graduate employment need contextualised contemporary rather making unrealistic comparison institution draw significantly different demographic
Having said considerable bias employment prospect graduate BME origin similar better qualification white counterpart even resulted graduate changing obtain interview
Most employer looking graduate two three year work experience past graduate recruitment scheme would take new graduate train workplace
These scheme largely vanished employer arguing investment wasted graduate swiftly move
There also many report suggest offshoring graduate IT work short term strategy employer strangling pipeline necessary develop experienced IT professional
Recent change school curriculum introduced teaching computer science GCSE emphasis coding reap significant benefit
Ensuring school pupil strong technical understanding computer science ability program develop computer system mean employer educator much stronger pool talent draw upon
In turn enable evolution training education meet future need IT industry
This positive development come nothing however address contributing factor result current high level computer science graduate unemployment
So
Two clear message emerge research
Firstly employment prospect BME graduate need tackled national level
Only parity treatment employer enable benefit widening access higher education particular success computer science attracting student diverse community
Secondly employer need incentivised reintroduce graduate training scheme stop offshoring graduate job provide employment prospect new graduate rebuild pool talent experience UK IT industry
These issue tackled locally nationally must tackled UK lose current position knowledge economy

In section look complex scene built simple shape
The key hierarchical structure
That complex object made simpler object turn made even simpler object bottom simple drawn directly
This called
We see studied play important role hierarchical modeling
Hierarchical structure key dealing complexity many area computer science rest reality surprise play important role computer graphic
A major motivation introducing new coordinate system possible use coordinate system natural scene want draw
We extend idea individual object scene When drawing object use coordinate system natural object
Usually want object natural coordinate centered origin least use origin convenient reference point
Then place scene use transform followed followed set size orientation position scene
Recall transformation used way called
The transforms often applied order scale rotate translate scaling rotation leave reference point fixed
Once object scaled rotated easy use translation move reference point desired point scene
Of course particular case might need three operation
Remember code transformation specified opposite order order applied object transformation specified drawing object
So code translation would come first followed rotation scaling
Modeling transforms always composed order common usage
The modeling transformation used place object scene affect object scene
To limit application one object save current transformation starting work object restore afterwards
How done differs one graphic another let suppose subroutine performing task
That make copy modeling transformation currently effect store copy
It change current transformation merely save copy
Later called retrieve copy replace current modeling transform retrieved transform
Typical code drawing object form Note know need know saved transform
Perhaps simply transform modify coordinate applied
Or might already another transform place coordinate transform affect scene whole
The modeling transform object effectively applied addition transform specified previously
The modeling transform move object natural coordinate proper place scene
Then top coordinate transform applied scene whole would carry object along
Now let extend idea
Suppose object want draw complex picture made number smaller object
Think example potted flower made pot stem leaf bloom
We would like able draw smaller component object natural coordinate system main object
For example would like specify bloom coordinate system center bloom
But easy We draw small component object bloom coordinate system use modeling transformation move position
We composing complex object natural coordinate system complete scene
On top apply modeling transformation complex object whole move actual scene complex object carried along
That overall transformation applies consists modeling transformation place complex object followed transformation place complex object scene
In fact build object made smaller object turn made even smaller object level
For example could draw bloom petal coordinate system apply modeling transformation place petal natural coordinate system bloom
There another transformation move bloom position stem yet another transformation place entire potted flower scene
This hierarchical modeling
Let look little example
Suppose want draw simple image cart two wheel
This cart used one part complex scene example
The body cart drawn pair rectangle
For wheel suppose written subroutine draw wheel
This subroutine draw wheel natural coordinate system
In coordinate system wheel centered radius
In cart coordinate system I found convenient use midpoint base large rectangle reference point
I assume positive direction point upward common convention mathematics
The rectangular body cart width height coordinate lower left corner rectangle draw command
The top cart smaller red rectangle drawn similar way
To complete cart need add two wheel object
To make size wheel fit cart need scaled
To place correct position relative body cart one wheel must translated left wheel right
When I coded example I play around number get right size position wheel I found wheel looked better I also moved bit
Using usual technique hierarchical modeling save current transform drawing wheel restore drawing wheel
This restricts effect modeling transformation wheel wheel alone affect part cart
Here pseudocode subroutine draw cart coordinate system It important note subroutine used draw wheel
The reason two wheel appear picture different position different modeling transformation effect two subroutine call
Once subroutine use add cart scene
When apply another modeling transformation cart whole
Indeed could add several cart scene wanted calling subroutine several time different modeling transformation
You notice analogy Building complex scene object similar building complex program subroutine
In case work piece problem separately compose solution big problem solution smaller problem solved problem reuse solution several place
Here demo us cart animated scene You probably guess hierarchical modeling used draw three windmill example
There method draw windmill coordinate system
Each windmill scene produced applying different modeling transform standard windmill
Furthermore windmill complex object constructed several using various modeling transformation
It might easy see different part scene animated
In fact animation another aspect modeling
A computer consists sequence frame
Each frame separate image small change one frame next
From point view frame separate scene drawn separately
The object appear many frame
To animate object simply apply different modeling transformation object frame
The parameter used transformation computed current time frame number
To make cart move left right example might apply modeling transformation cart frame number
In frame cart unit farther right previous frame
In fact actual program translation applied cart move reference point cart along horizontal axis every frame
In coordinate system used scene range put cart outside scene much loop
The really neat thing type animation work hierarchical modeling
For example method draw draw windmill turning vane
That mean rotation applied vane depends frame number
When modeling transformation applied windmill rotating vane scaled moved part object whole
This example hierarchical modeling
The vane windmill
The rotation vane part modeling transformation place vane windmill object
Then modeling transformation applied windmill object place scene
The file contains complete source code Java version example
The book cover graphic programming Java
Once familiar take look source code especially method draw entire scene
Logically component complex scene form structure
In structure object associated contains
If scene hierarchical structure hierarchical
This structure known
A scene graph structure root representing entire scene child root representing object scene
We visualize scene graph sample scene In drawing single object several connection one parent object
Each connection represents one occurrence object parent object
For example filled square object occurs cart windmill
It used twice cart windmill
The cart contains two red rectangle created square scaling pole windmill made scaled square
The filled circle used sun used twice wheel
The line used time sun time wheel I drawn one thick arrow marked represent connection
The wheel turn used twice cart
My diagram leaf lack space two occurrence filled square scene It used make road line middle road
Each arrow picture associated modeling transformation place parent object
When object contains several copy arrow connecting object different associated modeling transformation
The object copy transformation differs
Although scene graph exists conceptually application exists implicitly
For example Java version program mentioned draw image procedurally calling subroutine
There data structure represent scene graph
Instead scene graph implicit sequence subroutine call draw scene
Each node graph subroutine arrow subroutine call
The various object drawn using different modeling transformation
As discussed computer keep track current transformation represents transforms applied object
When object drawn subroutine program save current transformation calling subroutine
After subroutine return saved transformation restored
Inside subroutine object drawn coordinate system possibly calling subroutine draw modeling transformation
Those extra transformation effect outside subroutine since transform effect subroutine called restored subroutine return
It also possible scene graph represented actual data structure program
In approach graphical object scene represented program object
There many way build scene graph
For simple example implemented Java take look
This program draw animated scene previous example represents scene data structure rather procedurally
The scene graph API implemented live demo shown earlier page might take look read graphic
In example program Java JavaScript node scene graph represented object belonging class named
abstract class actual node scene graph defined subclass class
For example subclass named represent complex graphical object made
A variable type includes method adding compound object
When implementing scene graph data structure made object decision made handle transforms
One option allow transformation associated node scene graph
In case however I decided use special node represent transforms object type
A contains link another also contains modeling transformation applied object
The modeling transformation given term scaling rotation translation amount instance variable object
It worth noting always applied order scale rotate translate matter order instance variable set code
If want translation followed rotation need two implement since translation plus rotation would applied order
It also worth noting setter method scaling rotation translation return value equal object
This make possible chain call method single statement even say thing like This type chaining make compact code eliminate need lot extra temporary variable
Another decision made handle color
One possibility would make class similar
However case I added method main class
A color set compound object inherited unless different color set
In word color compound object act default color color overridden
In addition compound object transformed object need scene graph node represent basic graphical object occupy bottom level scene graph
These node actual drawing end
For familiar data structure I note scene graph actually example directed acyclic graph dag
The process drawing scene involves traversal dag
The term acyclic mean ca cycle graph
For scene graph obvious requirement object either directly indirectly
Suppose write subroutine draw object
At beginning subroutine use routine save copy current transform
At end subroutine call reset current transform back value saved
Now order work correctly hierarchical graphic routine must actually use transforms
Recall stack simply list item added pushed onto one end list removed popped end
The problem drawing complex object one subroutine call subroutine
This mean several drawing subroutine active time saved transform
When transform saved another transform already saved system need remember transforms
When called recently saved transform restored
A stack exactly structure needed implement operation
Before start drawing object would push current transform onto stack
After drawing object would pop transform stack
Between two operation object hierarchical transforms pushed onto popped stack needed
Some graphic APIs come transform stack already defined
For example original OpenGL API includes function using stack transformation matrix built OpenGL
The Java graphic API include stack transforms method getting setting current transform get set method used explicit stack data structure implement necessary operation
When turn HTML canvas API graphic see includes function named actually operation stack
These function essential implementing hierarchical graphic HTML canvas
Let try bring together considering applies simple object complex scene one filled circle part front wheel cart example scene
Here I rearranged part scene graph scene I added label show modeling transformation applied object The rotation amount wheel translation amount cart shown variable since different different frame animation
When computer start drawing scene modeling transform effect transform
As prepares draw cart save copy current transform identity pushing onto stack
It modifies current transform multiplying modeling transforms cart
When come drawing wheel push current transform modeling transform cart whole onto stack modifies current transform take wheel modeling transforms account
Similarly come filled circle save modeling transform wheel applies modeling transform circle
When finally circle actually drawn scene transformed combined transform
That transform place circle directly scene composed transform place circle wheel one place wheel cart one place cart scene
After drawing circle computer replaces current transform one pop stack
That modeling transform wheel whole transform used part wheel drawn
When wheel done transform cart popped
And cart done original transform identity popped
When computer go onto next object scene start whole process identity transform starting point
This might sound complicated I emphasize something computer
Your responsibility simply design individual object natural coordinate system
As part specify modeling transformation applied object
You construct scene whole similar way
The computer put everything together taking account many layer hierarchical structure
You deal one component structure time
That power hierarchical design help deal complexity

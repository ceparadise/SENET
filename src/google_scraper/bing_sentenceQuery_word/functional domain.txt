In style building structure element treat evaluation avoids data
It paradigm mean programming done declaration instead
In functional code output value function depends passed function calling function twice value argument produce result time contrast depending may produce different result different time called argument different program state
Eliminating change state depend function input make much easier understand predict behavior program one key motivation development functional programming
Functional programming origin developed investigate function definition
Many functional viewed elaboration lambda calculus
Another declarative programming paradigm based
In contrast change state command simplest example
Imperative programming mathematical sense
They may change value program state
Functions without therefore make sense
Because lack language expression result different value different time depending state executing program
Functional programming language largely emphasized rather commercial software development
However prominent programming language support functional programming also known used industrial commercial application wide variety organization
one world widely distributed language property untyped functional language addition imperative paradigm
Functional programming also supported like statistic financial analysis
Widespread declarative language like use element functional programming especially eschewing
Programming functional style also accomplished language specifically designed functional programming
For example imperative programming language subject book describing apply functional programming concept
This also true programming language
added construct facilitate functional style
The language also offer functional programming ability
An interesting case frequently written functional style presence side effect mutable state place grey area imperative functional language
provides theoretical framework describing function evaluation
It mathematical abstraction rather programming form basis almost current functional programming language
An equivalent theoretical formulation commonly perceived abstract lambda calculus preceded invention
Combinatory logic lambda calculus originally developed achieve clearer approach
An early language developed late scientific computer MIT
Lisp first introduced many paradigmatic feature functional programming though early Lisps incorporated support numerous programming style new paradigm evolved
Later dialect offshoot sought simplify rationalise Lisp around cleanly functional core designed preserve update paradigmatic feature numerous older dialect replaced
IPL sometimes cited first functional programming language

presented lecture Can Programming Be Liberated From Style
A Functional Style Algebra Programs
He defines functional program built hierarchical way mean combining form allow algebra program modern language mean functional program follow
Backus paper popularized research functional programming though emphasized rather style associated functional programming
In created initially developed language later language
Also Edinburgh Burstall Darlington developed functional language
NPL based first introduced work program transformation
Burstall MacQueen Sannella incorporated polymorphic type checking ML produce language
ML eventually developed several dialect common
Meanwhile development simple impurely functional dialect Lisp described influential classic textbook brought awareness power functional programming wider community
In developed also called type theory associated functional program arbitrarily complex mathematical proposition expressed
This led powerful new approach influenced development many subsequent functional programming language
The began consensus form functional programming research implementation release ongoing since
A number concept paradigm specific functional programming generally foreign including
However programming language often hybrid several programming paradigm programmer using mostly imperative language may utilized concept
function either take function argument return result
In calculus example function return function
function closely related function function allow function argument result function
The distinction two subtle describes mathematical concept function operate function computer science term describes programming language entity restriction use thus function appear anywhere program entity like number including argument function return value
function enable technique applies function argument one time application returning new function accepts next argument
This let programmer succinctly express example addition operator partially applied one
expression memory
This mean pure function several useful property many used optimize code While compiler imperative programming language detect pure function perform elimination pure function call always library generally expose information thus preventing optimization involve external function
Some compiler add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external function pure enable optimization
also let function designated
looping functional language usually accomplished via
invoke letting operation repeated reach
Though recursion requires maintaining stack recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative language
The language standard requires implementation recognize optimize tail recursion
Tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program compiling among approach
Common pattern recursion factored using higher order function fold unfolds obvious example
Such higher order function play role analogous control structure
Most general purpose functional programming language allow unrestricted recursion make cause unsoundness generally requires introduction logic expressed language
Some special purpose language allow recursion nonterminating computation expressed infinite stream value called
As consequence language fail Turing complete expressing certain function impossible still express wide class interesting computation avoiding problem introduced unrestricted recursion
Functional programming limited recursion constraint called
Functional language categorized whether use evaluation concept refer function argument processed expression evaluated
The technical difference expression containing failing divergent computation
Under strict evaluation evaluation term containing failing subterm fails
For example expression fails strict evaluation division zero third element list
Under lazy evaluation length function return value number item list since evaluating attempt evaluate term making list
In brief strict evaluation always fully evaluates function argument invoking function
Lazy evaluation evaluate function argument unless value required evaluate function call
The usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional language
Lazy evaluation used default several pure functional language including
argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity easing independent implementation producer consumer data stream
Launchbury describes difficulty lazy evaluation introduces particularly analyzing program storage requirement proposes aid analysis
Harper proposes including strict lazy evaluation language using language type system distinguish
Especially since development functional programming language tended use rejecting invalid program compilation time risking opposed accepts valid program compilation time risk used Lisp variant though reject invalid program runtime information enough reject valid program
The use make manipulation complex data structure convenient presence strong type checking make program reliable absence reliability technique like free programmer need manually declare type compiler case
Some functional language based let type depend term
Such type called
These type system decidable type inference difficult understand program
But dependent type express arbitrary proposition
Through program language become mean writing formal compiler generate
While language mainly interest academic research including begun used engineering well
subset written Coq formally verified
A limited form dependent type called GADT implemented way provides benefit dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience
GADT available since version case class proposed addition language including Java C
Functional program assignment statement value variable functional program never change defined
This eliminates chance side effect variable replaced actual value point execution
So functional program referentially transparent
Consider assignment statement change value assigned variable
Let u say initial value two consecutive evaluation variable yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
In fact assignment statement never referentially transparent
Now consider another function transparent implicitly change input x thus
Functional program exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent
It possible use functional style programming language traditionally considered functional language
For example explicitly support pure function
inception
Amrit Prem added support Python well closure Python though Python relegated reduce standard library module
function introduced mainstream language
In lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style
In sometimes used simulate however anonymous class always proper replacement limited capability
Java support lambda expression replacement anonymous class
However presence checked exception Java make functional programming inconvenient necessary catch checked exception rethrow problem occur JVM language checked exception Scala
In necessary lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style C
Many expressible functional programming term example simply dictate use function pattern roughly corresponds
Similarly idea immutable data functional programming often included imperative programming language example tuple Python immutable array
Purely functional often represented different way counterpart
For example constant access update time basic component imperative language many imperative based array
Arrays replaced admit purely functional implementation access update time
Therefore purely functional data structure used language may efficient tool especially persistence required
Functional programming different
The significant difference stem fact functional programming avoids used imperative programming implement state
Pure functional programming completely prevents provides
function rarely used older imperative programming
A traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list
A functional program hand would probably use map function take function list generating returning new list applying function list item
There task example maintaining bank account balance often seem naturally implemented state
Pure functional programming performs task task accepting user input printing screen different way
The pure functional programming language implement using derived
Monads offer way abstract certain type computational pattern including limited modeling computation mutable state side effect imperative manner without losing purity
While existing monad may easy apply program given appropriate template example many student find difficult understand conceptually asked define new monad sometimes needed certain type library
Another way functional language simulate state passing around represents current state parameter function call
On function call copy data structure created whatever difference result function
This referred
Impure functional language usually include direct method managing mutable state
example us managed reference updated applying pure function current state
This kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure function preferred way express computation
Alternative method developed track side effect program
Some modern research language use make presence side effect explicit
Functional programming language typically le efficient use memory imperative language
This related fact mutable data structure like array straightforward implementation using present hardware highly evolved Turing machine
Flat array may accessed efficiently deeply pipelined CPUs prefetched efficiently cache complex handled SIMD instruction
It also easy create equally efficient immutable counterpart
For purely functional language slowdown logarithmic number memory cell used mutable memory represented purely functional data structure logarithmic access time balanced tree
However slowdown universal
For program perform intensive numerical computation functional language slightly slower C according
For program handle large multidimensional functional language designed speed optimization
Immutability data many case lead execution efficiency allowing compiler make assumption unsafe imperative language thus increasing opportunity
may also speed program even asymptotically whereas may slow constant factor however may introduce used improperly
Launchbury discus theoretical issue related memory leak lazy evaluation give practical advice analyzing fixing
However general implementation lazy evaluation making extensive use dereferenced code data perform poorly modern processor deep pipeline cache cache miss may cost hundred cycle
Imperative program environment sequence step manipulating environment
Functional program expression successively substituted reach normal form
An example illustrates different solution programming goal calculating

Throughout book going using technique called We ca give complete definition term yet chapter introduce building block functional programming Basically mean function thing high school algebra teacher meant except function necessarily relate number
But essential idea like kind function described
In example name function function take called number number
In chapter going use computer explore function going use standard Scheme notation rest book
That chapter want separate idea function complexity programming language notation
For example real Scheme notation let write expression involve one function chapter use one time
To get chapter special computer interface first start running Scheme first chapter type tell Scheme read program using
If trouble loading program look Appendix A information
Then start program type You able carry interaction like following
In text printed type type printing As see different function different number argument
In example added two number took square root one number
However every function give exactly one result time use
To leave program type asks function
Experiment arithmetic function
Try different kind number including integer number decimal fraction
What try divide zero
Throughout chapter going let experiment function rather give long boring list one work
The boring list available reference page
Try These suggestion
Be creative type example
Not Scheme function deal number
A broader category argument including number also including English word like
Even meaningless sequence letter digit considered word
Try function accept word argument
What happens use number argument one
So far function fall one two category arithmetic function require number argument return number result word function accept word argument return word result
The one exception seen
What kind argument accept
What kind value return
The technical term kind data In principle could think almost anything type number contain digit
Such type legitimate sometimes useful also official type Scheme know
Types overlap example number also considered word
The technical term thing function accepts argument function
The name thing function return So domain word range number fact nonnegative integer
This example show range may exactly one standard data type nonnegative integer type Scheme
How talk domain range function
You could say example The function number domain number range
Or informally may also say take number argument return number
For function two argument language little le straightforward
The informal version still work take two integer argument return integer
But ca say The domain two integer domain function possible argument statement characteristic legal argument
By way making certain simplification chapter
For example Scheme function actually accept number argument two
But want go bell whistle start adding two number time
Here example illustrate domain function We going introduce data type function include type domain range
The next type bunch word enclosed parenthesis Do include punctuation character within sentence
Many function accept word domain also accept sentence
There also function accepts word sentence
Try example like sentence
Other important function used ask question
That range function contains two value one meaning true meaning false
Try numeric comparison function work word sentence
The question mark part name function
There also function whose domain range value
The two value true false called named George Boole developed formal tool used value mathematics
What good value
Often program must choose two option If number positive negative
Scheme function make choice based value
For experiment function
Its first argument must true false others anything
So far data type include number word sentence Booleans
Scheme several data type consider one
A used data
Here example The range nonnegative integer
But domain For example try using argument
If used computer programming language may seem strange use part computer data
Most language make sharp distinction program data
soon see ability treat function data help make Scheme programming powerful convenient
Try example Think carefully
You applying function sentence applying function function sentence
Other function used include whose domain integer whose domain everything
If reading book trying thing computer go along get work
Spend time getting used idea thinking
When done read ahead
The idea heart mathematics computer science
For example mathematician want think formally system number use function create integer
They say let suppose one number called zero let suppose given
By applying function repeatedly create
Functions important computer science give u way think simple English way think something happening something changing
A function embodies information taking something know returning something know
That computer They transform information produce new result
A lot mathematics taught school number seen function number
used function word sentence even function function
You imagine function transform information kind function French window function capital California
You done lot thinking function
You add two number make sense add two word number
Some function complicated domain acceptable value one argument depend specific value used one
The function example make sure tried positive negative number fractional well power
Part definition function always get answer whenever call function argument
The value returned function word change regardless anything else may computed meanwhile
One function explored chapter real function according rule one
The rule may seem restrictive indeed often convenient use name function loosely process give different result different circumstance
But see sometimes important stick strict definition refrain using process truly function
We hinted two different way thinking function
The first called Here function rule tell u transform information information
The function rule thing right
The actual thing word number whatever function manipulates
The second way thinking called In view function perfectly good thing
We use function argument another function example
Research college math student show second idea hard people worth effort see function function like make program much easier write
As homey analogy think carrot peeler
If focus attention want peeler represents process
We peeling carrot
We applying function carrot
It carrot count
But also think peeler thing right clean worry whether blade sharp enough
The big idea explored chapter although used lot Chapter function using result one function argument another function
crucial idea write large program defining bunch small function composing produce desired result
We start next chapter return real Scheme notation
In line following table left one piece information
Fill missing detail
What domain function
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
Make sure try lot case
Hint Think name
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
The following exercise ask function meet certain criterion
For convenience function chapter
List function chapter type return value always different type argument
List function chapter type return value sometimes different type argument
Mathematicians sometimes use term operator mean function two argument type return result type
Which function seen chapter satisfy definition
An operator possible argument
For example commutative
Which operator Exercise commutative
An operator possible argument
For example associative
Which operator Exercise associative
Certain punctuation character also used word let defer detail gotten know word function simpler example
Unless version Scheme complex number
Real mathematician say The domain Cartesian cross product integer integer
In order avoid mouthful use informal wording
Yes English word
It astronomy
chapter thread

branch study special kind posets commonly called
Consequently domain theory considered branch
The field major application used specify especially
Domain theory formalizes intuitive idea approximation convergence general way close relation
An alternative important approach denotational semantics computer science
The primary motivation study domain initiated late search
In formalism one considers function specified certain term language
In purely way one go simple function function take function input argument
Using syntactic transformation available formalism one obtain called definition property function
To formulate denotational semantics one might first try construct lambda calculus genuine total function associated lambda term
Such model would formalize link lambda calculus purely syntactic system lambda calculus notational system manipulating concrete mathematical function
The model
However element combinator calculus function function function order element model lambda calculus arbitrary domain range could true function
Scott got around difficulty formalizing notion partial incomplete information represent computation yet returned result
This modeled considering domain computation
natural number additional element represents output
result computation never end
In addition domain computation equipped undefined result
The important step find model lambda calculus consider function partially ordered set guaranteed least fixed point
The set function together appropriate ordering domain sense theory
But restriction subset available function another great benefit possible obtain domain contain
one get function applied
Beside desirable property domain theory also allows appealing intuitive interpretation
As mentioned domain computation always partially ordered
This ordering represents hierarchy information knowledge
The higher element within order specific information contains
Lower element represent incomplete knowledge intermediate result
Computation modeled applying repeatedly element domain order refine result
Reaching equivalent finishing calculation
Domains provide superior setting idea since fixed point monotone function guaranteed exist additional restriction approximated
In section central concept definition domain theory introduced
The intuition domain emphasized motivate mathematical formalization theory
The precise formal definition found dedicated article concept
A list general definition include domain theoretic notion well found
The important concept domain theory nonetheless introduced
As mentioned domain theory deal model domain computation
The goal interpret element order element higher order extend information element consistent way
From simple intuition already clear domain often since would mean element contains information rather uninteresting situation
A concept play important role theory domain directed subset subset order two element element subset
In view intuition domain mean two piece information within directed subset extended element subset
Hence view directed subset
set partial result two element contradictory
This interpretation compared notion element specific preceding one
Indeed theory sequence play role many aspect analogous role directed set domain theory
Now case sequence interested directed set
According said would element general piece information extends information element directed set
unique element contains information present directed set nothing
In formalization order theory directed set
As case limit sequence least upper bound directed set always exist
Naturally one special interest domain computation consistent specification
order directed set least upper bound
This property defines class short
Indeed consideration domain theory consider order least directed complete
From underlying idea partially specified result representing incomplete knowledge one derives another desirable property existence
Such element model state place computation start
It also regarded output computation return result
Now basic formal description domain computation turn computation
Clearly function taking input computational domain returning output possibly different domain
However one would also expect output function contain information information content input increased
Formally mean want function
When dealing one might also want computation compatible formation limit directed set
Formally mean function image directed set
set image element directed least upper bound image least upper bound
One could also say
Also note considering directed set two element function also monotonic
These property give rise notion function
Since often ambiguous one also may speak
Domain theory purely approach modeling structure information state
One say something contains information amount additional information specified
Yet situation one want speak element sense much simpler much incomplete given state information
For example natural ordering infinite element
set much informative subset
If one want model relationship one may first want consider induced strict order domain order
However useful notion case total order tell u much case partially ordered set
Considering set set already strictly smaller another possibly infinite set contains one le element
One would however hardly agree capture notion much simpler
A elaborate approach lead definition suggestively also called
An element element every directed set supremum element Then one also say writes This imply since singleton set directed
For example ordering set infinite set way finite subset
On hand consider directed set fact chain finite set Since supremum chain set natural number show infinite set way
However way element notion reveal much element alone
For example one would like characterize finite set way even infinite set way set
The special property element way
An element property also called
Yet element finite compact mathematical usage term
The notation nonetheless motivated certain parallel respective notion
The compact element domain important special property obtained limit directed set already occur
Many important result relation support claim definition appropriate capture many important aspect domain
The previous thought raise another question possible guarantee element domain obtained limit much simpler element
This quite relevant practice since compute infinite object may still hope approximate arbitrarily closely
More generally would like restrict certain subset element sufficient getting element least upper bound
Hence one defines poset subset set element way contains directed set supremum
The poset base
Especially base situation
In many application one restricts continuous cpos main object study
Finally even stronger restriction partially ordered set given requiring existence base element
Such poset called
From viewpoint denotational semantics algebraic posets particularly since allow approximation element even restricting finite one
As remarked every finite element finite classical sense may well finite element constitute set
In case however base poset
In case one speaks poset
Accordingly countable base consists entirely finite element obtain order
A simple special case domain known
This consists set incomparable element integer along single bottom element considered smaller element
One obtain number interesting special class ordered structure could suitable domain
We already mentioned continuous posets algebraic posets
More special version continuous algebraic
Adding even one obtains respective property
For algebraic case one find broader class posets still worth studying historically first structure studied domain theory
Still wider class domain constituted
All class order cast various dcpos using function monotone even specialized morphisms
Finally note term exact thus used abbreviation formal definition given detail irrelevant
A poset dcpo chain supremum
If continuous function domain least fixed point given least upper bound finite iteration least element This

Computer Science Fundamentals Acccelerated hour course designed year old student
It taught week school club integrated unit longer technology class used intro computer science class
Students learn create computer program help learn collaborate others develop skill persist difficult task
They study programming concept computational thinking digital citizenship develop interactive game story share
The course teach foundational concept programming using drag drop block rather programming language JavaScript Python
Blocks easier way get started many top Universities today begin class block based programming
The Accelerated Course combine concept taught accelerated fashion designed older student
All lesson align relevant computer science standard well
They additionally reinforce concept skill taught subject area integrating national standard

How teach kid programming computer science much learning code
Most people quit
Here idea link help answer question
In past year I published magazine first year common question people asked Where I child begin learn code Or How I teach kid programming computer science My answer variation It It depends whether child adult parent teacher
It also depends learning code answer
Learning comfortable technology learning technology work learning technology help hurt u individually society answer question Where I begin learn code Writing publishing magazine taught vast majority people start coding quit
They get bored
Or coding hard
Or coding really fit thing
For example coding requires lot problem solving skill turn requires balance rigid step step process intuition based experience
Not everybody like combination
From start magazine published article based guideline developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA If learn lot topic give coding never learn code understand technology work technology appropriate
If learn code terrific
However learning code helpful required technology literate
With prologue specific answer question Where I begin learn code If kid year old especially younger sibling might want start game toy teach programming concept
For example Robot Turtles great board game neat extension like online community create game board
These game sometimes let replace object direct game person like child parent adding another level fun engagement
In style Move Turtle phone application let kid basic programming
Kids adult give direction move turtle make turtle thing
Each step corresponds programming activity specify action detail action example move action forward way screen detail action
There also robot like KIBO robot developed Tufts University geared kid age
KIBO Kickstarter looking mass market technology
Kids almost age also might appreciate Computer Science Unplugged computational thinking project
Like board game project teach computer science programming concept without computer
If kid comfortable game like Robot Turtles CS Unplugged activity might try next project coding aspect
Robots like Sphero make easy direct cute little robot ball around room graduate programming robot
Computational thinking project also project basic programming Python useful advanced project
From simple use coding kid also gravitate programming language geared towards kid education language like Python
For example least one ebook online teach basic Python kid
They learn small bit language importantly learn programming concept
Languages geared towards kid tend use Logo language kid enter basic direction avatar often turtle follows direction screen use block language like Scratch Alice Tynker several others
These language make easy kid focus language le specific syntax
In contrast adult use programming language syntax structure critical bit code slightly le important
When kid might start beginning board game programmable robot language geared towards education
But also might dive language like PHP Python JavaScript part reading online finding neat project trying replicate project computer
They also might love game learn modify game get coding
I used web browser View Source menu example learn HTML CSS JavaScript million people year ago
Technology everywhere number way older kid latch learn
While parent might mixed feeling kid lost hour video game game lead programming
Minecraft put Raspberry Pi computer designed help kid get hardware software project
Skyrim game make somewhat easy older kid research code modification make game even fun
I also highly recommend find local programming group like Coder Dojo kid adult work together computing project
It structured way relax fun technology engaging people
Technology social activity strictly solo
You also learn sharing debating
And I would encourage parent kid look online resource geared towards teacher teach computer science programming
Often resource like Minecraft Education parent use get kid started kid explore
Bottomline though true subject important start kid adult place find comfortable provide tool explore find way
Programming computer science fascinating absorbing
But discover
A teacher parent ca force enthralled concept making computer something
What I found interesting publishing magazine many teacher want learn programming computer science much student
There lot energy fun ingenuity going teaching computer science coding classroom
Even better fad
Teachers get connection math taught kid generation example math used computing
Teachers also get need guideline online behavior another critical skill want technology literate
What applies kid adult also applies teacher many option learn computer programming computer science
It important holistic focus strictly learning skill
It important kid well rounded view technology love gadget healthy respect work might might fit society
While teacher might enjoy board game Robot Turtles might work great kindergarten first grade classroom Computer Science Unplugged project project geared towards time constraint classroom well laser focus one topic project
If student graduate programming tool like Scratch Alice Tynker Codea Minecraft like great kid project within single class period period time
There many resource online help distill programming language education project kid handle easily
Finally Skype classroom great example technology teacher kid use connect teacher classroom
You learn programming necessarily
But teacher student expand horizon learn lot world engage people would never meet otherwise
As I noted start biggest lesson learned first year publishing magazine coding answer
The answer exposure technology computer science programming
Most people never code
Yet learn enough programming realize phone tablet computer device magical
They tool created human being like
And tool limitation benefit
Tools extremely fun use
It also true group charged creating programming computer science curriculum treat programming one aspect curriculum
While lot hype outside classroom everyone must learn code people charged creating curriculum student take holistic broader view
I want thank reader subscriber great first year publishing magazine
I started Help Kids Code way explore computer science coding meet write people really neat stuff
It fun ride
I look forward second year
To give Americans particular general idea country teach programming computer science
Tim writer technologist enjoys teaching tech people
He many year experience web site application business technical creative role
He wife two kid teenager mad video game
Codea app designed make easy create game software
Here tutorial link online resource
Here quick introduction Raspberry Pi find one get set sort neat project
With link step
Summer great time get outdoors learn technology meet people summer tech camp local tech group
Github important tool used programmer manage code project
Here Github tutorial link learn
It fun easy create ASCII art computer keyboard text editor imagination
Here idea get started
Alice teach programming concept kid create animated movie friendly interface storytelling

An archive vitally concerned authenticity integrity holding
An authentic record loosely one purport duly issued authorized person agency
A record integrity preserved without alteration would impair use authentic record
The issue record assurance topic chapter discussed greater detail technical issue report two reason
First committee address topic depth first report emphasized system design related acquisition issue
Second digital assurance area correct implementation requires great care
To ensure authenticity integrity paper record archivist worked technique establishing chain custody record issuer record user
Although technique applied digital record property digital record compel use additional technique ensuring authenticity integrity
Digital technique available provide much stronger assurance existing technique paper record
Also digital record potentially vulnerable forgery attacker access archive computer could add delete alter record wholesale fashion make subtle alteration would difficult detect inspection
Increased experience personal computer made public aware easily digital document altered undetectably
The committee firmly belief within decade public court little confidence digital record lack best assurance technology provide
Digital check another huge advantage archive verify integrity record periodically
If error due hardware medium failure operator error unauthorized redundant undamaged copy record retrieved
When form auditing performed often enough error archive fixed spread redundant copy created erroneous record
A comprehensive system design address authenticity integrity many piece great many design operational detail
This chapter first describes basic tool principle digital record assurance offer basic detailed approach
Those approach presented example level care must applied claimed possible approach
Digital assurance record based fundamentally maintaining multiple geographically administratively separated copy using cryptographic technique provide integrity checking secure transmission record archive
These technique appropriate application archive discussed
Multiple geographically administratively separated replication provides essential technique protecting integrity
There various way meet requirement involving complete replica multiple partial replica
A detailed design start reasonable goal acceptable bit loss rate desired availability local site
Given reliability metric local site one compute reliability replicated archive total archive designed achieve specified level reliability
At given point time engineering design question achieve goal manner currently available storage technology
Storage technology relative price evolving rapidly National Archives Records Administration NARA need flexible design evolve along
As described cryptographic technique provide basic tool ensuring authenticity integrity
Both quality depend cryptographic algorithm forgery computationally infeasible defeating system altering original record without altering digest signature would require many sample record much computing power attacker resource succeed
The technique computing hash digest checksum record used check integrity
A secure hash algorithm computes compact hash digest digital bit comprise record
There several algorithm common use Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS Publication specifies four standard algorithm
The standard explains secure hash algorithm one computationally infeasible find More detail assurance technique found following report National Research Council Computer Science Telecommunications Board published National Academy Press Washington message corresponds given message digest find two different message produce message digest
Any change message high probability result different message In field database witness technical term hash digest computed record first enters system
One later verifies integrity offered record computing new hash digest offered record comparing new value witness
Various cryptographic technique used ensure received sent
A digital record authenticated creating digital signature verified anyone using record
If record altered way signature check fail
To sign digital object one performs cryptographic transformation typically witness digital object hash digest rather object create known authentication tag signature given digital object
To verify origin digital object one performs algorithm involves second cryptographic transformation taking input authentication tag public key verified authenticity output binary value origin verified origin The meaning origin verified object originated someone possessed private key
One must trust putative possessor private key properly protected one could created authentication tag
It important recognize digital signature limited value preservation chain custody data integrity
Their value limited validity window secret signing key signature algorithm public key shorter
For example private key used form digital signature record becomes compromised certain date record verified public key corresponding private key date suspect
The case private key becoming compromised longer use subtle compromise endanger record already verified allows attacker forge document record creation date one key still valid
Discovery compromise key may come long time actually occurred
Compromise could also occur result cryptoanalytic attack
Digital signature therefore excellent mean verifying recently transmitted set record transferred agency National Institute Standards Technology NIST

came claimed came poor mean authenticating origin stored data
Digital signature used together several cryptographic tool establish secure communication channel
The Secure Sockets Layer SSL protocol first implemented Netscape browser later standardized Internet Engineering Task Force implemented today widely used Web browser example secure channel
It establishes secure channel top insecure channel provided Internet Transmission Control Protocol TCP exchange credential using digital signature negotiation shared secret key exchange message authentication code MACs
The MACs essentially signature mechanism
One important step sometimes overlooked application SSL protocol report end secure connection
For authentication complete recipient must check report see correspondent identifies expected one
Many current Web browser use SSL either omit deemphasize step consequence supposedly secure channel may secure
record assurance depends measure digital signature secure channel
It requires record ingest securely transmitting data origin NARA recording metadata assurance maintaining integrity stored data associated metadata record resides archive
These two step ingest retention examined following section
Agencies create retain record must use appropriate technique authenticating origin record maintaining integrity remain custody agency
When record transferred NARA agency transmit along record metadata exhibit audit record assurance using agency internal technique
If agency maintained integrity check included part metadata
Digital signature may helpful verification depending particular circumstance
If set record digitally signed digital signature system still operational validity window see believed expired agency provide additional information record validity checking signature recording result metadata
On hand would problematic NARA perform verification verification depends operation system outside NARA control
Moreover agency retains custody record lengthy period must face prospect validity window digital assurance expires record transferred NARA
Once record authenticity verified record ingested primary requirement record verification method outcome metadata use integrity assurance protect integrity record metadata retained archive
As NARA evolves away transfer storage based delivery physical medium toward transfer online storage use robust safeguard transferring record agency NARA becomes even important
For example verifying electronic file transfer via File Transfer Protocol FTP yield file right number byte provides little assurance either unintentional corruption deliberate tampering
Assurances transmission Electronic Records Archives ERA ingest component originating agency system needed provide adequate assurance transmitted data come claimed source thus unauthorized person attempted submit false record record altered transmission
The best option NARA use standard scheme rather custom scheme would necessarily subject le scrutiny
A good example standard widely used scheme today properly authenticated SSL connection
Records sent securely via channel
Alternatively secure channel used send individual hash value record record sent way long checked hash value NARA end
If Standard Form Agreement Transfer Records National Archives United States becomes electronic future would also appropriate authenticate securely transmit form well
Multiple copy integrity check protect mechanical threat integrity address biggest remaining threat integrity human error
To illustrate careful look agency report reveals another copy agency report accidentally created someone clicked Revert clicking Save Such error occur within agency record reach NARA ingestion process
NARA ingest process designed minimize opportunity human error sort
In addition NARA may able afford human occasionally inspect incoming record query originating agency resolve problem
The result interaction agency would constitute additional metadata ingest received assurance record record authentic representation document given title
In word ingest negotiation add additional metadata
This observation intended suggest NARA undertake comprehensive examination repair record ingest
The starting point full design assurance archived record carry careful comprehensive threat assessment see discussion
This section considers several obvious threat technique available address
Designing digital assurance electronic record archive similar designing security measure
First cryptographic technique must chosen carefully archive must ready change cryptographic algorithm us
For example someone discover way create two different document generate hash digest current hash algorithm algorithm would need replaced
Second overall system design cryptographic mechanism must allow opening attacker
For example attacker surreptitiously tinker code NARA run perform signature hash code verification make say yes said assurance worthless
If vulnerability discovered system require modification
Multiple geographically separated copy provide fundamental basis establishing integrity
Hash algorithm provide performance enhancement checking record corrupted whether hardware failure system error deliberate tampering
The integrity record verified computing hash digest bit record comparing digest previously calculated separately protected witness record
If two digest match integrity record established high degree probability
A witness computed bit stream includes record plus metadata representing time hash computed provides digital time stamp allows one verify content object time witness calculated published
Although description integrity checking presented assumed record carry separate hash digest need case
After integrity consideration apply individual record also collection series record
A town clerk issue marriage license July pass record archive also attests record constitute entire collection license issued license issued July
A hash computed set record given order
Checking hash may require retrieving record based recomputing hash might
In exchange however fewer known good hash published
To protect malevolent change attacker record witness must separately protected attacker manages gain access order change record also alter witness
Since hash digest written relatively small number digit one way protect change publish public place classified advertisement major newspaper short time publication distributed microfilm many hundred library otherwise depositing hash value hundred library
Such hash publication service could provided Government Printing Office currently distributes government document Federal Depository Libraries
Because integrity checking requires able establish relationship record published hash digest unique record identifier associated record useful
The published list simply correspondence record identifier hash digest
Techniques combining hash value used reflect integrity huge archive using single hash digest practical publish large number individual hash
The straightforward approach would compute single hash digest formed hashing hash digest every record archive sequential computation would prohibitively
Also combination concatenating hash value may lower precision integrity check
Techniques devised require far le computation update single hash value archive changed lower precision check
The important property technique compute single hash value value irrefutably depends precise content every record archive
Cryptographic protection part solution however
They detect damage attack fact
Prevention repair even crucial depend careful procedure system design handling digital record
They include maintenance multiple geographically administratively separated copy access control audit log retention old deleted file recover unauthorized faulty operation procedural safeguard changing archive content reduce human error requiring multiple people authorize change
These protection measure important order avoid correct tampering archive
Although cryptographic technique detect tampering occurred able deter repair tampering
What stored record found contain error
What one cryptographic algorithm digital assurance based shown easy subvert
Over life record archive event sure occur
Thus archive must designed anticipate corrective response
Errors may creep archive record verified ingested
This could happen result hardware failure operational error software bug malicious attack something else
Errors detected comparing file archive another copy reading file calculating current hash comparing hash separately protected witness file
There must ongoing process performs comparison error accumulate unnoticed
One approach first suggested Ralph Merkle Protocols Public Key Cryptosystems pp
IEEE Computer Society Press Los Alamitos build binary tree million witness value follows
The leaf value internal node hash concatenation two child
The root tree published widely available hard tamper major newspaper stored microfilm library across nation
Stored million witness value following linking information list sibling hash value one accompanied bit indicating whether right left sibling along path leaf published hash value

The technology offered commercially Surety Inc
When integrity check fail repair investigation required
First invalid data must restored mirror backup provided redundancy mechanism designed archive
Second cause error must investigated
Failure rigorously investigate case failed integrity eventually lead failure protect archive modifying system design response essential part iterative design
If turn file improperly altered ERA software operator necessary undo certain change archive
Repair facilitated designing file system allow operation modify file undone least level technique similar used implement undo desktop software applied file system well
The effective technique limit amount archive modified ideally storage would treated read software portion archive collection record assembled ingest process would modifiable
record may course subject transformation combat obsolescence process add new form delete old form
Cryptographic algorithm compromise distinct possibility must assumed happen point lifetime ERA
Breakthroughs mathematics cryptanalysis computing power lifetime ERA may result successful attack function form basis digital assurance used archive
For example result reported Annual International Cryptology Conference held Santa Barbara indicated weakness hash function commonly used today
After conference NIST announced plan phase use Secure Hash Algorithm SHA recommended federal standard cryptographic hash function
In announced team cryptanalyst university China invented new algorithm attacking substantially faster previously known attack
While result far short devastating compromise existing standard algorithm remind u algorithm may impregnable
If cryptographic algorithm compromised hash value computed using algorithm would provide assurance integrity
The following provision therefore essential archival preservation Archive system designed accommodate replacement cryptographic function allow record reprocessed attach revised digital assurance
security signature system accommodate one cryptographic algorithm reason provision especially important owing long lifetime archive system
Replacement algorithm recalculation hash value performed compromise threatened hash algorithm developed accepted cryptographic community
Better algorithm adopted early rather waiting older algorithm known compromised
This action would guard old integrity scheme compromised unbeknownst NARA new one applied
One way introducing new integrity scheme would require addition hashing system integrity would also secure system
Suppose implementation particular system place consider pair valid certificate implementation digital record Now suppose time later improved system implemented replacing hash function used original system new hash function even perhaps invention completely new algorithm
Is way use new system buttress guarantee integrity supplied certificate face potential later attack old system
One could simply submit request new system would lose connection original time certification
Another possibility submit request new system would vulnerable later occurrence devastating attack hash function used computation follows adversary could find another record hash value hash collision renewal system could used backdate original time
Suppose instead pair new system resulting new certificate time done definite later date original method compromised
The certificate provides evidence record content existed prior time new also existed time stated original certificate prior compromise old implementation way create valid certificate legitimate mean
Whatever output system produce response request particular bit string signature returned system

Archive system also support multiple algorithm simultaneously
It would prudent use two hash function parallel anticipation future cryptanalytic advance
In addition migration new hash scheme would likely performed time record copied one medium storage system another rather
describes approach putting new integrity scheme place
The issue algorithm compromise ongoing operational concern
Someone must pay enough attention keep track need apply new integrity scheme must make judgment call add new scheme system
Once new scheme added new hash value readily calculated course routine scan archive error
By using standard scheme NARA leverage knowledge wide community cryptographer system designer inform decision time
For example NARA look NIST monitor development area issue advisory advice
When delivers electronic record batch record customer NARA use secure transmission method digital signature provides assurance data trusted originated NARA checked origin data ingest held data trusted repository
Such protection also provide assurance data tampered transit leaving ERA system
The record original form considered
But additional information derived form metadata also protected level assurance
During operation ERA may need create alternative form record ingests
These alternative may needed simplify meeting ERA user need derived form described committee first report prevent record becoming unusable data type encoded becomes obsolete meet need certain user redaction classified record
In case new form record contain bit original result neither authentication integrity checking associated original record apply new form
Nevertheless chain trust established original record new form assured cryptographic technique
The basic idea operation transforms record order create new one must certify following record used input authority imputed transformation process integrity output process
Whether transformation involves computer processing includes manual process redaction transformation process must make certification
It includes unambiguous identification input record record identifier hash digest unambiguous identification output record record identifier hash digest perhaps information identity person performing redaction version number software performs conversion
The transformation process process thus unambiguously identified user record new form thus presented assurance history document
Users decide based trust impute transformation process applied whether trust new record
The scientific community record process analyzes sensor data grappling similar problem
Agencies discipline seeking keep track transformation applied stream data include NOAA weather NASA satellite imagery physic record particle accelerator experiment
Developments area may prove useful NARA future
Some metadata essential accompaniment record must protected accordingly
For example date record created may part record instead recorded metadata
This metadata must protected digital assurance rest record
Some metadata may change time revised metadata standard change better technique become available extracting metadata record content
This information similar derived form assured audit trail identifies original input record process used derive new metadata
Threat modeling systematic technique enumerating threat digital system
It includes among element developing scenario involving accidental deliberate misuse system might lead vulnerability
The model used analyze system design understand performs different scenario
After developing threat model designing way counter expected threat building system one observe system see kind integrity authenticity security failure occur despite carefully laid plan
Next failure analysis used adjust threat model design additional better procedure upgrade system
The process repeated entire lifetime system
Systems provide fault tolerance integrity security life safety require kind continual iteration throughout entire life cycle
The buzzword design iteration style system design make feedback mechanism essential component system design
An ideal scheme digital assurance would afford verification authenticity integrity
That reader record many decade creation would able directly verify authenticity creator integrity record preservation
As described current technique limited piecemeal assurance together bridge validity window key management system cryptographic algorithm transformation
An ideal scheme currently available perhaps research improve technique depend today see
With present technique assurance bridging technique strong weakest link
An archive superbly guarantee integrity record useful agency sending record archive sloppy aspect stewardship record custody
To ensure ERA decade hence valued source authentic government record entire chain record custody must use robust assurance
The preceding argument clearly call digital assurance applied record throughout life starting time ingested NARA
However digital assurance technique currently widespread either government commercial information technology IT system electronic system
NARA mission preserve essential evidence suggests take much active role promoting digital authentication integrity assurance technique agency use safeguard record create
If NARA provide attestation record hold record honored valid environment significantly better practice exist
A ERA serve exhibit best practice digital retention electronic record including technical operational method assuring record authenticity integrity
Also new government IT system developed new system developed procured NARA assist agency adoption acceptable digital assurance measure
These technique require software create maintain digital signature like also operational measure issue manage cryptographic key operational measure ensure system compromised
The Records Management Redesign initiative currently underway provides opportunity inaugurate promote use digital assurance technique government record
The thrust initiative engage agency overall mission taking responsibility defining creating maintaining digital record form streamlines preservation later use record
Strong assurance vital aspect electronic record preservation received adequate attention
Until record creator use digital assurance method conform NARA standard agency create hold electronic record held stringent standard holding
When record without digital assurance transferred NARA custody NARA immediately augment record suitable digital assurance maintained throughout record life ERA
The ultimate goal must achieve maintain best digital assurance practice creating agency archive
The federal government generates increasingly save large growing fraction record electronic form
In National Archives Record Administration NARA launched Electronic Archives ERA program create system preserve provide access federal electronic record
To assist project NARA asked NRC conduct study provide advice develops ERA program
The first two report phase one provided recommendation design engineering related issue facing program
This report phase two focus longer term strategic issue including technology trend shape ERA system archival process ERA future evolution system
It also provides assessment technical design issue associated record integrity authenticity

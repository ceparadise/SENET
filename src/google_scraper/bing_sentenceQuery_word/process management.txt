This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

integral part OS
The OS must allocate resource enable process share exchange information protect resource process process enable synchronization among process
To meet requirement OS must maintain process describes state resource ownership process enables OS exert control process
In many modern operating system one instance loaded memory time example one user could executing program user separate copy program loaded memory
With program possible one copy loaded memory several user shared access execute
Such program said
The instant executing one instruction one program several process sustained period time assigning process processor interval remainder become temporarily inactive
A number process executed period time instead time called
A OS system executing many process concurrently
Multiprogramming requires processor allocated process period time appropriate moment
If processor execution process must done way restarted later easily possible
There two possible way OS regain control processor program execution order OS perform allocation The stopping one process starting restarting another process called context change
In many modern operating system process consist many
This introduces concept
A thread may viewed separate independent sequence execution within code one process
Threads becoming increasingly important design distributed system software run system
A common trait observed among process associated computer program alternate cycle cycle
For portion time required CPU cycle process executed
occupying CPU
During time required cycle process using processor
Instead either waiting perform actually performing
An example reading writing file disk
Prior advent operated system
Users system quickly became aware much time computer allocated single user processor idle user entering information debugging program example
observed overall performance machine could improved letting different process use processor whenever one process waiting
In user execute program individual execution time total time service process consecutively user would However process consumes CPU cycle cycle time process actually us CPU small fraction total execution time process
So process time process spends using CPU total execution time process
time CPU cycle plus cycle carried executed completion process
In fact usually sum processor time used process rarely exceeds small fraction time execute one process Therefore system processor lay idle considerable proportion time
To overcome inefficiency multiprogramming implemented modern operating system
This enables processor switch one process X another Y whenever X involved phase execution
Since processing time much le single job runtime total time service user multiprogramming system reduced approximately Operating system need way create process
In simple system designed running single application controller microwave oven may possible process ever needed present system come
In system however way needed create terminate process needed operation
There four principal event cause process created When operating system booted typically several process created
Some foreground process interacts human user perform work
Other background process associated particular user instead specific function
For example one background process may designed accept incoming sleeping day suddenly springing life incoming arrives
Another background process may designed accept incoming request web page hosted machine waking request arrives service request
Process creation UNIX Linux done fork clone system call
There several step involved process creation
The first step validation whether sufficient authorization create process
Upon successful validation parent process copied almost entirely change unique process id parent process
Each new process get user space
There many reason process termination The principal responsibility controlling execution
This includes determining interleaving pattern execution allocation resource process
One part designing describe behaviour would like process exhibit
The simplest model based fact process either executed processor
Thus process may considered one two state
When operating system creates new process process initially labeled placed queue system state
The process portion exists wait queue opportunity executed
After period time currently process interrupted moved state state making processor available different process
The dispatch portion OS select queue process one waiting process transfer processor
The chosen process relabeled state state execution either begun new process resumed process interrupted earlier time
From model identify design element OS Although process management model perfectly valid design operating system absence state mean lie idle active process change CPU cycle cycle
This design make efficient use processor
The process management model designed overcome problem introducing new state called state
This state describes process waiting event take place
In case event mean use device signal another process
The three state model At instant process one one three state
For single processor computer one process state one instant
There many process state state associated queue process
Processes entering system must go initially state process enter state via state
Processes normally leave system state
For three state process occupies space main memory
While reason transition one state another might obvious may clear
While three state model sufficient describe behavior given event extend model allow possible event sophisticated design
In particular use portion hard disk emulate main memory called requires additional state describe state process suspended main memory placed virtual memory disk
Of course process future time resumed transferred back main memory
The Medium Level control event
A process suspended state giving rise two state namely
A process suspended becomes process suspended becomes
A process suspended number reason significant arises process swapped memory memory management system order free memory process
Other common reason process suspended one suspends execution debugging program system monitoring process
For process management model consider following transition described next section
Each system represented data structure called PCB Process Descriptor performs function traveller passport
The PCB contains basic information job including Each process uniquely identified user identification pointer connecting descriptor
This indicates current status process
This contains information needed indicate current state job
This contains information used mainly billing purpose performance measurement
It indicates kind resource process used long
Contemporary incorporate mode bit define execution capability program processor
This bit set
Kernel mode also commonly referred
In kernel mode processor execute every instruction hardware repertoire whereas user mode execute subset instruction
Instructions executed kernel mode called kernel privileged protected instruction distinguish user mode instruction
For example instruction privileged
So program executes user mode perform
Instead must request OS perform behalf
The system may logically extend mode bit define area memory used processor kernel mode versus user mode
If mode bit set kernel mode process executing processor access either kernel user partition memory
However user mode set process reference user memory space
We frequently refer two class memory user space system space kernel supervisor protected space
In general mode bit extends operating system protection right
The mode bit set user mode trap instruction also called supervisor call instruction
This instruction set mode bit branch fixed location system space
Since system code loaded system space system code invoked via trap
When OS completed supervisor call reset mode bit user mode prior return
The part critical correct operation execute generic system software application program execute
This fundamental distinction usually irrefutable distinction operating system
The part system executing kernel supervisor state called nucleus
The kernel operates trusted software meaning designed implemented intended implement protection mechanism could covertly changed action untrusted software executing user space
Extensions OS execute OS rely correctness part system software correct operation OS
Hence fundamental design decision function incorporated OS whether need implemented kernel
If implemented kernel execute kernel supervisor space access part kernel
It also trusted software part kernel
If function implemented execute access kernel data structure
However advantage normally require limited effort invoke function
While function may easy implement trap mechanism authentication time call usually relatively expensive
The kernel code run fast large performance overhead actual call
This subtle important point
There two technique program executing user mode request service designed one two facility
First assume wish invoke particular target system function
For approach user process us trap instruction
The idea system call appear ordinary procedure call application program provides library user function name corresponding actual system call
Each stub function contains trap OS function
When application program call stub executes trap instruction switch branch indirectly OS table entry point function invoked
When function completes switch processor return control user process thus simulating normal procedure return
In approach user process construct message describes desired service
Then us trusted send function pas message trusted
The send function serf purpose trap carefully check message switch kernel mode delivers message process implement target function
Meanwhile user process wait result service request message receive operation
When OS process completes operation sends message back user process
The distinction two approach important consequence regarding relative independence OS behavior application process behavior resulting performance
As rule thumb based interface made efficient requiring message exchanged distinct process
This case even though system call must implemented trap instruction even though trap relatively expensive perform efficient message passing approach generally higher cost associated process message formation message copying
The system call approach interesting property necessarily OS process
Instead process executing change executing kernel code switch back user mode return OS call
If hand OS designed set separate process usually easier design get control machine special situation kernel simply collection function executed user process kernel mode
Even operating system usually find necessary include least called handle situation whereby machine otherwise idle handling network

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

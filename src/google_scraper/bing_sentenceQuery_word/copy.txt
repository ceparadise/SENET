A recording discretely
Just word written paper information written computer file
There different designed different purpose
A file may designed store picture written message wide variety kind data
Some type file store several type information
By using computer program person open read change close computer file
Computer file may reopened modified copied arbitrary number time
Typically computer file organised keep track file enables people access
The word file derives Latin thread
File used publicly context computer storage early February In RCA advertisement describing new memory vacuum tube developed RCA stated result countless computation kept file taken
Such exists tube developed RCA Laboratories
Electronically retains figure fed calculating machine hold storage memorizes new one speed intelligent solution maze mathematics
In file denoted information stored
In early use underlying hardware rather content stored denominated file
For example disk drive denominated disk file
The introduction circa MIT concept managed several virtual file one storage device origin contemporary denotation word
Although contemporary demonstrates early concept file use greatly decreased
On modern file organized array
The file defined content since file solely container data although platform format usually indicated specifying rule byte must organized interpreted meaningfully
For example byte plain text file Windows associated either character byte image video audio file interpreted otherwise
Most file type also allocate byte allows file carry basic information
Some file system store arbitrary interpreted file system data outside file format linked file example
On file system done via database
All method however susceptible loss metadata format
At instant time file might size normally expressed number indicates much storage associated file
In modern operating system size whole number byte system limit
Many older operating system kept track number occupied file physical storage device
In system software employed method track exact byte count used special control character signal end text file
The general definition file require size real meaning however unless data within file happens correspond data within pool persistent storage
A special case file newly created file yet data written may serve kind file system accident result aborted disk operation
For example file link point typical system probably defined size seldom change
Compare also file size may obscure
This misleading really file system resource including device accessed like file still real distinction file core behave obscurity size one manifestation
As character device size
Information computer file consist smaller packet information often called line individually different share common trait
For example payroll file might contain information concerning employee company payroll detail record payroll file concern one employee record common trait related similar placing payroll information specific filing cabinet office computer
A text file may contain line text corresponding printed line piece paper
Alternatively file may contain arbitrary binary image may contain
The way information grouped file entirely designed
This led plethora le standardized file structure imaginable purpose simplest complex
Most computer file used create modify delete file use basis
The programmer create program decide file needed used often name
In case computer program manipulate file made visible computer user
For example user manipulates document file user personally name
Although content document file arranged format program understands user able choose name location file provide bulk information word text stored file
Many application pack data file single file called using internal marker discern different type information contained within
The benefit archive file lower number file easier transfer reduce storage usage organize outdated file
The archive file must often unpacked next using
The basic operation program perform file Files computer created moved modified grown shrunk deleted
In case computer program executed computer handle operation user computer also manipulate file necessary
For instance file normally created modified Microsoft Word program response user command user also move file directly using Windows computer CLI
In system program operate directly low level file
Only kernel deal file handle interaction file manner transparent program
The provides level mean interaction file simply filename instead
For example delete file file
There many link file removed considers file memory space free reallocated
This commonly considered security risk due existence
Any program us system function wipe file data
In modern computer system file typically accessed using name
In operating system name associated file
In others file anonymous pointed link name
In latter case user identify name link file false analogue especially exists one link file
Files link file located directory
However generally contain either list file list link file
Within definition paramount importance term file includes directory
This permit existence directory hierarchy directory containing
A name refers file within directory must typically unique
In word must identical name within directory
However operating system name may include specification type mean directory contain identical name one type object directory file
In environment file named file name path file directory must uniquely identify among file computer two file name path
Where file anonymous named reference exist within namespace
In case name within namespace refer exactly zero one file
However file may represented within namespace zero one name
Any string character may may name file link depending upon context application
Whether name depends type computer system used
Early computer permitted letter digit name file modern computer allow long name character containing almost combination letter unicode digit making easier understand purpose file glance
Some computer system allow file name contain space others
file name determined
Unix file system usually case sensitive allow application create file whose name differ case character
support multiple file system different policy regarding
The common file system multiple file whose name differ case user us edit file name
User application however usually allow user create multiple file name differing case
Most computer organize file hierarchy using folder directory catalog
The concept irrespective terminology used
Each folder contain arbitrary number file also contain folder
These folder referred subfolders
Subfolders contain still file folder thus building structure one master folder root folder name varies one operating system another contain number level folder file
Folders named file except root folder often name
The use folder make easier organize file logical way
When computer allows use folder file folder name also path identifies folder folder file folder resides
In path sort special used separate file folder name
For example illustration shown article path uniquely identifies file called folder called turn contained folder called
The folder file name separated slash example topmost root folder name path begin slash root folder name would precede first slash
Many computer system use file name help identify contain also known file type
On Windows computer extension consist dot period end file name followed letter identify type file
An extension identifies text file extension identifies type document documentation commonly
Even extension used computer system degree computer system recognizes heed vary system required system completely ignored presented
Many modern computer system provide method protecting file accidental deliberate damage
Computers allow multiple user implement control may may modify delete create file folder
For example given user may granted permission read file folder modify delete user may given permission read modify file folder execute
Permissions may also used allow certain user see content file folder
Permissions protect unauthorized tampering destruction information file keep private information confidential unauthorized user
Another protection mechanism implemented many computer When flag turned file accomplished computer program human user file examined modified
This flag useful critical information must modified erased special file used internal part computer system
Some system also include make certain file invisible flag used computer system hide essential system file user alter
Any file useful purpose must physical manifestation
That file abstract concept real computer system must real physical analogue exist
In physical term computer file stored type data storage device
For example store file
Hard disk ubiquitous form storage since early
Where file contain temporary information may stored
Computer file also stored medium case etc
The use also beginning rival hard disk drive
In operating system many file associated physical storage device
Examples file directory
These virtual file exist object within operating system kernel
As seen running user program file usually represented either
A File control block FCB area memory manipulated establish filename
passed operating system parameter used older IBM operating system early PC operating system including early version
A file handle generally either integer introduced around running ubiquitous
When computer file contain information extremely important process used protect disaster might destroy file
Backing file simply mean making copy file separate location restored something happens computer deleted accidentally
There many way back file
Most computer system provide utility program assist process become many file safeguard
Files often copied removable medium writable CDs cartridge tape
Copying file another hard disk computer protects failure one disk necessary protect failure destruction entire computer copy file must made medium taken away computer stored safe distant location
The method automatically make three grandfather file oldest copy file son current copy
The way computer organizes name store manipulates file globally referred Most computer least one file system
Some computer allow use several different file system
For instance newer MS Windows computer older file system old version Windows supported addition file system normal file system recent version Windows
Each system advantage disadvantage
Standard FAT allows file name plus extension space example whereas NTFS allows much longer name contain space
You call file NTFS FAT would restricted something like unless using FAT extension allowing long file name
program utility program allow user manipulate file directly
They allow move create delete rename file folder although actually allow read content file store information
Every computer system provides least one program native file system
For example File Explorer formerly Windows Explorer commonly used Microsoft Windows operating system Nautilus common several distribution Linux

basic unit information storage processing
A byte consists digit consists
The string bit making byte processed unit computer byte smallest operable unit storage computer
A byte represent equivalent single character letter B comma percentage sign represent number
Because byte contains little information processing storage capacity computer hardware usually given gigabyte GB one billion byte terabyte TB one trillion byte
Because byte root binary digit originally one kilobyte byte byte thus one megabyte MB byte
However notable exception computer industry switched decimal prefix prefix denote thousandfold increase byte
bit called byte
group called byte
Because digital computer use byte ASCII code commonly embedded field consisting seven information bit parity bit used purpose represent special symbol
The use system device processing storing displaying information
meant person computation term almost universally refers automated electronic machinery
code used digital computer based binary number system two possible state usually symbolized
Whereas decimal system employ digit digit position represents power etc

In hardware software component store data future request data served faster data stored cache might result earlier computation duplicate data stored elsewhere
A occurs requested data found cache occurs
Cache hit served reading data cache faster recomputing result reading slower data store thus request served cache faster system performs
To enable efficient use data cache must relatively small
Nevertheless cache proven many area computing access pattern typical exhibit
Moreover access pattern exhibit data requested recently requested already refers request data physically stored close data already requested
There inherent size speed given larger resource implies greater physical distance also tradeoff expensive premium technology v cheaper easily commodity
The provided cache benefit A larger resource incurs significant access
take hundred clock cycle modern GHz processor reach
This mitigated reading large chunk hope subsequent read nearby location
Prediction explicit might also guess future read come make request ahead time done correctly latency bypassed altogether
The use cache also allows higher underlying resource assembling multiple fine grain transfer larger efficient request
In case DRAM might served wider bus
Imagine program scanning byte address space served chip data bus individual uncached byte access would allow total used data movement would address
Reading larger chunk reduces fraction bandwidth required transmitting address information
Hardware implement cache memory temporary storage data likely used
CPUs HDDs frequently use cache web browser web server
A cache made pool entry
Each entry associated data copy data
Each entry also tag specifies identity data backing store entry copy
When cache client CPU web browser need access data presumed exist backing store first check cache
If entry found tag matching desired data data entry used instead
This situation known
So example web browser program might check local cache disk see local copy content web page particular URL
In example URL tag content web page data
The percentage access result cache hit known cache
The alternative situation cache consulted found contain data desired tag become known
The previously uncached data fetched backing store miss handling usually copied cache ready next access
During cache miss CPU usually ejects entry order make room previously uncached data
The used select entry eject known
One popular replacement policy least recently used LRU replaces least recently used entry see
More efficient cache compute use frequency size stored content well throughput cache backing store
This work well larger amount data longer latency slower throughput experienced hard drive Internet efficient use CPU cache
When system writes data cache must point write data backing store well
The timing write controlled known
There two basic writing approach A cache complex implement since need track location written mark later writing backing store
The data location written back backing store evicted cache effect referred
For reason read miss cache requires block replaced another often require two memory access service one write replaced data cache back store one retrieve needed data
Other policy may also trigger data
The client may make many change data cache explicitly notify cache write back data
No data returned write operation thus two approach situation Both policy use either policy usually paired way Entities cache may change data backing store case copy cache may become
Alternatively client update data cache copy data cache become stale
Communication protocol cache manager keep data consistent known
Small memory close operate faster much larger
Most CPUs since used one cache sometimes modern server may many six type cache level function
Examples cache specific function
Earlier GPUs often limited introduced improve
would drastically affect performance
used
Caching important leverage wider transfer texture data often little bit per pixel indexed complex pattern arbitrary
As GPUs advanced especially developed progressively larger increasingly general cache including exhibiting increasingly common functionality CPU cache
For example architecture GPUs feature cache GPU KB cache GPU KB cache GPU KB cache
These cache grown handle thread interface
similarly generalised year
Earlier design used fed modern DSPs often include similar set cache CPU
shared split
A MMU fetch page table entry main memory specialized cache used recording result translation
This specialized cache called TLB
While CPU cache generally managed entirely hardware variety software manages cache
The main memory example disk cache managed operating system
While integrated part hard disk drive sometimes misleadingly referred disk cache main function write sequencing read prefetching
Repeated cache hit relatively rare due small size buffer comparison drive capacity
However often cache hard disk drive
Finally fast local hard disk drive also cache information held even slower data storage device remote server local scheme main concept
Also fast SSDs used cache slower hard disk drive working together SSHDs
employ web cache store previous response
Web cache reduce amount information need transmitted across network information previously stored cache often
This reduces bandwidth processing requirement web server help improve user web
Web browser employ web cache ISPs organization also use caching proxy server web cache shared among user network
Another form cache file sought application stored cache accelerate transfer
Similarly decentralised equivalent exist allow community perform task traffic example Corelli
A cache store data computed demand rather retrieved backing store
technique store result within lookup table allowing subsequent call reuse stored result avoid repeated computation
The BIND daemon cache mapping domain name resolver library
operation common operating unreliable network like Ethernet LAN enormous complexity required multiple cache communication unreliable
For instance web page cache cache like typically specifically keep network protocol simple reliable
also frequently make indexed available cache
For example provides Cached link next search result
This prove useful web page temporarily permanently inaccessible
Another type caching storing computed result likely needed
For example program cache output compilation order speed later compilation run
substantially improve throughput application example processing frequently used subset data
A us networked host provide scalability reliability performance application
The host spread different geographical region
The semantics buffer cache totally different even fundamental difference intent process caching process buffering
Fundamentally caching realizes performance increase transfer data repeatedly transferred
While caching system may realize performance increase upon initial typically write transfer data item performance increase due buffering occurring within caching system
With read cache data item must fetched residing location least order subsequent read data item realize performance increase virtue able fetched cache faster intermediate storage rather data residing location
With write cache performance increase writing data item may realized upon first write data item virtue data item immediately stored cache intermediate storage deferring transfer data item residing storage later stage else occurring background process
Contrary strict buffering caching process must adhere potentially distributed cache coherency protocol order maintain consistency cache intermediate storage location data resides
Buffering hand With typical caching implementation data item read written first time effectively buffered case write mostly realizing performance increase application write originated
Additionally portion caching protocol individual writes deferred batch writes form buffering
The portion caching protocol individual read deferred batch read also form buffering although form may negatively impact performance least initial read even though may positively impact performance sum individual read
In practice caching almost always involves form buffering strict buffering involve caching
A temporary memory location traditionally used CPU directly address data stored peripheral device
Thus addressable memory used intermediate stage
Additionally buffer may feasible large block data assembled disassembled required storage device data may delivered different order produced
Also whole buffer data usually transferred sequentially example hard disk buffering sometimes increase transfer performance reduces variation jitter transfer latency opposed caching intent reduce latency
These benefit present even buffered data written read buffer
A cache also increase transfer performance
A part increase similarly come possibility multiple small transfer combine one large block
But main occurs good chance data read cache multiple time written data soon read
A cache sole purpose reduce access underlying slower storage
Cache also usually designed invisible perspective neighboring layer

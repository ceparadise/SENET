In unambiguous specification solve class problem
Algorithms perform task
An algorithm expressed within finite amount space time formal language calculating
Starting initial state initial input perhaps instruction describe proceeds finite number successive state eventually producing output terminating final ending state
The transition one state next necessarily algorithm known incorporate random input
The concept existed century however partial formalization would become modern began attempt solve decision problem posed
Subsequent formalization framed attempt define effective method formalization included
Giving formal definition algorithm corresponding intuitive notion remains challenging problem
The word combination word named word

An informal definition could set rule precisely defines sequence operation
would include computer program including program perform numeric calculation
Generally program algorithm stop eventually
A prototypical example algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integer example others described example later section
offer informal meaning word following quotation No human write fast enough long enough small smaller smaller without limit trying write molecule atom electron list member enumerably infinite set writing name one another notation
But human something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite set They give arbitrary finite
Such instruction given quite explicitly form An enumerably infinite set one whose element put correspondence integer
Thus Boolos Jeffrey saying algorithm implies instruction process creates output integer input integer integer theory arbitrarily large
Thus algorithm algebraic equation two arbitrary input variable produce output
But various author attempt define notion indicate word implies much something order addition example The concept also used define notion
That notion central explaining come starting small set rule
In time algorithm requires complete measured apparently related customary physical dimension
From uncertainty characterize ongoing work stem unavailability definition suit concrete sense abstract usage term
Algorithms essential way computer process data
Many computer program contain algorithm detail specific instruction computer perform specific order carry specified task calculating employee paycheck printing student report card
Thus algorithm considered sequence operation simulated system
Authors assert thesis include Minsky Savage Gurevich Minsky But also maintain Turing


procedure could naturally called effective fact realized simple machine
Although may seem extreme argument

Gurevich Turing informal argument favor thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm simulated Turing machine according Savage algorithm computational process defined Turing machine
Typically algorithm associated processing information data read input source written output device stored processing
Stored data regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm
In practice state stored one
For computational process algorithm must rigorously defined specified way applies possible circumstance could arise
That conditional step must systematically dealt criterion case must clear computable
Because algorithm precise list precise step order computation always crucial functioning algorithm
Instructions usually assumed listed explicitly described starting top going bottom idea described formally
So far discussion formalization algorithm assumed premise
This common conception attempt describe task discrete mechanical mean
Unique conception formalized algorithm setting value variable
It derives intuition scratchpad
There example assignment
For alternate conception constitutes algorithm see
Algorithms expressed many kind notation including processed
Natural language expression algorithm tend verbose ambiguous rarely used complex technical algorithm
Pseudocode flowchart control table structured way express algorithm avoid many ambiguity common natural language statement
Programming language primarily intended expressing algorithm form executed computer often used way define document algorithm
There wide variety representation possible one express given program sequence machine table see flowchart see form rudimentary called set quadruple see
Representations algorithm classed three accepted level Turing machine description For example simple algorithm Add described three level see
Most algorithm intended implemented
However algorithm also implemented mean biological example implementing insect looking food mechanical device
In algorithm basically instance written software software developer effective intended target computer produce given perhaps null
An optimal algorithm even running old hardware would produce faster result higher algorithm purpose running efficient hardware algorithm like computer hardware considered technology
The notion simplicity elegance appears informally Knuth precisely Chaitin Chaitin preface definition I show ca prove program proof would solve ibid
For given function multiple algorithm may exist
This true even without expanding available instruction set available programmer
Rogers observes It


important distinguish notion

mapping yielded procedure
The function may several different algorithm
Unfortunately may tradeoff goodness speed elegance compactness elegant program may take step complete computation one le elegant
An example us Euclid algorithm appears
A computer human computor restricted type machine discrete deterministic mechanical device blindly follows instruction
Melzak Lambek primitive model reduced notion four element discrete distinguishable ii discrete indistinguishable iii agent iv list instruction relative capability agent

Rarely must programmer write code limited instruction set
But Minsky show Melzak Lambek machine four general instruction conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO HALT
Knuth advises reader best way learn algorithm try


immediately take pen paper work example
But simulation execution real thing
The programmer must translate algorithm language execute
Stone give example computing root quadratic equation computor must know take square root
If algorithm effective must provide set rule extracting square root
This mean programmer must know language effective relative target computing agent
But model used simulation
Van Emde Boas observes even base abstract instead concrete machine arbitrariness choice model remains
It point notion enters
When speed measured instruction set matter
For example subprogram Euclid algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster programmer instruction available rather subtraction worse Minsky decrement
Per algorithm computed model known per Minsky demonstration Turing completeness requires four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT
Kemeny Kurtz observe undisciplined use unconditional GOTOs conditional GOTOs result programmer write structured program using instruction hand also possible hard write badly structured program structured language
Tausworthe augments three SEQUENCE two CASE
An additional benefit structured program lends using
The graphical aide called offer way describe document algorithm computer program one
Like program flow Minsky machine flowchart always start top page proceeds

One simplest algorithm find largest number list number random order
Finding solution requires looking every number list
From follows simple algorithm stated description English prose Written prose much closer language computer program following formal coding algorithm algorithm compute GCD two number appears Proposition II Book VII Elementary Number Theory
Euclid pose problem thus Given two number prime one another find greatest common measure
He defines A number multitude composed unit counting number positive integer including zero
To measure place shorter measuring length successively time along longer length remaining portion le shorter length
In modern word remainder quotient remainder modulus part left division
For Euclid method succeed starting length must satisfy two requirement length must zero AND ii subtraction must proper test must guarantee smaller two number subtracted larger alternately two equal subtraction yield zero
Euclid original proof add third requirement two length must prime one another
Euclid stipulated could construct proof two number common measure fact
While Nicomachus algorithm Euclid number prime one another yield number common measure
So precise following really Nicomachus algorithm
Only instruction required execute Euclid logical test conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement subtraction
The following algorithm framed Knuth version Euclid Nicomachus rather using division find remainder us successive subtraction shorter length remaining length le
The description shown boldface adapted Knuth Until remaining length R le shorter length S repeatedly subtract measuring number S remaining length EITHER last measure exact remainder R zero program halt OR ii algorithm must continue last measure left remainder R le measuring number The nut Euclid algorithm
Use remainder measure previously smaller number L serf temporary location
The following version Euclid algorithm requires six core instruction thirteen required Inelegant worse Inelegant requires instruction

Does algorithm author want
A test case usually suffice confirm core functionality
One source us
Knuth suggested
Another interesting case two number
But exceptional case must identified tested
Will Inelegant perform properly R S S R R S
Ditto Elegant B A A B A B
Yes
What happens one number zero number zero
Inelegant computes forever case Elegant computes forever A
What happens number entered

A notable failure due exception rocket failure June
Knuth demonstrates application extended version Euclid algorithm proposes general method applicable proving validity algorithm
Tausworthe proposes measure complexity program length correctness proof
With six core instruction Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant thirteen instruction
However Inelegant arrives HALT fewer step
indicates case Elegant conditional test every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant one
As algorithm usually requires many much time wasted B
test needed remainder computed
Once programmer judge program fit effective computes function intended question becomes improved
The compactness Inelegant improved elimination five step
But Chaitin proved compacting algorithm automated generalized algorithm rather done exhaustive search example found trial error cleverness insight application etc
Observe step repeated step
Comparison Elegant provides hint step together step eliminated
This reduces number core instruction thirteen eight make elegant Elegant nine step
The speed Elegant improved moving
test outside two subtraction loop
This change call addition three instruction B A GOTO
Now Elegant computes faster whether always case given A B R S would require detailed analysis
It frequently important know much particular resource time storage theoretically required given algorithm
Methods developed obtain quantitative answer estimate example sorting algorithm time requirement O using length list
At time algorithm need remember two value largest number found far current position input list
Therefore said space requirement space required store input number counted O counted
Different algorithm may complete task different set instruction le time space others
For example algorithm cost O log n outperforms sequential search cost O n used sorted list array
The discipline often practiced abstractly without use specific implementation
In sense algorithm analysis resembles mathematical discipline focus underlying property algorithm specific particular implementation
Usually used analysis simplest general representation
However ultimately algorithm usually implemented particular hardware software platform eventually put test using real code
For solution one problem efficiency particular algorithm may significant consequence unless n extremely large algorithm designed fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may critical
Scaling small n large n frequently expose inefficient algorithm otherwise benign
Empirical testing useful may uncover unexpected interaction affect performance
may used compare potential improvement algorithm program optimization
To illustrate potential improvement possible even well established algorithm recent significant innovation relating algorithm used heavily field image processing decrease processing time time application like medical imaging
In general speed improvement depend special property problem common practical application
Speedups magnitude enable computing device make extensive use image processing like digital camera medical equipment consume le power
There various way classify algorithm merit
One way classify algorithm implementation mean
Another way classifying algorithm design methodology paradigm
There certain number paradigm different
Furthermore category include many different type algorithm
Some common paradigm For specific classification algorithm algorithm problem may fall one general category described well one following Every field science problem need efficient algorithm
Related problem one field often studied together
Some example class algorithm
Fields tend overlap algorithm advance one field may improve sometimes completely unrelated field
For example dynamic programming invented optimization resource consumption industry used solving broad range problem many field
Algorithms classified amount time need complete compared input size Some problem may multiple algorithm differing complexity problem might algorithm known efficient algorithm
There also mapping problem problem
Owing found suitable classify problem instead algorithm equivalence class based complexity best possible algorithm
The adjective continuous applied word algorithm mean Algorithms usually patentable

Lets say I designing many type bike want write one program
I would first decide bike common wheel frame seat etc
I write program us variable I get feature

There many different type expressed diverse array modeling language tool set
This article offer taxonomy model type highlight different model must work together support broader effort
There many different type model associated address different aspect system different
Since different model serve different classification model useful selecting right type model intended purpose
Since model representation system many different expression vary degree formalism could considered model
In particular one could draw picture system consider model
Similarly one could write description system text refer model
Both example representation system
However unless meaning term potential lack precision possibility ambiguity representation
The primary focus system modeling use model supported modeling language
While le formal representation useful model must meet certain expectation considered within scope
In particular initial classification distinguishes informal formal model supported modeling language defined syntax relevant interest
The United States Department Defense Modeling Simulation M S Glossary asserts model physical mathematical otherwise logical representation system
This definition provides starting point high level model classification
A concrete representation distinguished mathematical logical model abstract representation system

Typical descriptive model may include describe functional physical system three dimensional geometric representation system
An describes mathematical relationship differential equation support quantifiable analysis system parameter
Analytical model classified dynamic static model
Dynamic model describe state system whereas static model perform computation represent state system
A dynamic model may represent performance system aircraft position velocity acceleration fuel consumption time
A static model may represent mass property estimate prediction system component
A particular model may include descriptive analytical aspect described model may favor one aspect
The logical relationship descriptive model also analyzed inference made reason system
Nevertheless logical analysis provides different insight quantitative analysis system parameter
Both descriptive analytical model classified according domain represent
The following classification partially derived presentation Web Ontology Language OWL Systems Modeling Language SysML Jenkins The model classification terminology approach often adapted particular application domain
For example modeling model may referred workflow model performance modeling may refer schedule performance associated organization business process
A single model may include multiple domain category list
For example reliability thermal power model may defined electrical design communication subsystem aerospace system aircraft satellite
System model hybrid model descriptive analytical
They often span several modeling domain must ensure consistent system representation
As system model must provide system construct construct shared across modeling domain
A system model may comprise multiple view support planning requirement design analysis
Wayne Wymore credited one early effort formally define system model using mathematical framework Wymore
Wymore established rigorous mathematical framework designing system context
A summary work found
The term specifically refers method implementing model time DoD
The computer simulation includes analytical model represented executable code condition input data computing infrastructure
The computing infrastructure includes computational engine needed execute model well input device
The great variety approach computer simulation apparent choice designer computer simulation must make include Other classification simulation may depend type model simulated
One example simulation simulates interaction among autonomous agent predict behavior Barry
They many type model could used classify simulation
In general simulation provide mean analyzing complex dynamic behavior system software hardware people physical phenomenon
Simulations often integrated actual hardware software operator system evaluate actual component user system perform simulated
Within United States defense community common refer simulation live virtual constructive live simulation refers live operator operating real system virtual simulation refers live operator operating simulated system constructive simulation refers simulated operator operating simulated system
The virtual constructive simulation may also include actual system hardware software loop well stimulus real system environment
In addition representing system environment simulation must provide efficient computational method solving equation
Simulations may required operate real time particularly operator loop
Other simulation may required operate much faster real time perform thousand simulation run provide statistically valid simulation result
Several computational simulation method described Law
Computer simulation result analytical result often need processed presented user meaningful way
Visualization technique tool used display result various visual form simple plot state system versus time display parametric relationship
Another example occurs input output value several simulation execution displayed response surface showing sensitivity output input
Additional statistical analysis result may performed provide probability distribution selected parameter value
Animation often used provide virtual representation system dynamic behavior
For example animation display aircraft position orientation function time well project aircraft path surface Earth represented detailed terrain map
Many different type model may developed artifact MBSE effort
Many model created component design analysis
The different descriptive analytical model must integrated order fully realize benefit approach
The role MBSE model integrate across multiple domain primary theme International Council Systems Engineering INCOSE INCOSE
As example system model used specify component system
The descriptive model system architecture may used identify partition component system define interconnection relationship
Analytical model performance physical quality characteristic reliability may employed determine required value specific component property satisfy system requirement
An represents interaction system component may used validate component requirement satisfy system behavioral requirement
The descriptive analytical executable system model represent different facet system
The component design must satisfy component requirement specified system model
As result component design analysis model must level ensure design model traceable requirement model
The different design discipline electrical mechanical software create model representing different facet system
It evident different model must sufficiently integrated ensure cohesive system solution
To support integration model must establish ensure construct one model meaning corresponding construct another model
This information must also exchanged modeling tool
One approach semantic interoperability use different model
Transformations defined establish correspondence concept one model concept another
In addition establishing correspondence tool must mean exchange model data share transformation information
There multiple mean exchanging data tool including file exchange use application program interface API shared repository
The use modeling language model transformation data exchange important enabler integration across modeling domain

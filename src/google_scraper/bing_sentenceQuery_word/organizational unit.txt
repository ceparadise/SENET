Organizational unit commonly appear directory certificate LDAP directory AD directory certificate tree may feature almost modern directory digital certificate grouping system
In system organizational unit appear within organization grouping organization certificate called domain
In many system one OU also exist within another OU
When OUs nested one OU contains another OU creates relationship contained OU called child container called parent
Thus OUs used create hierarchy container within domain
Only OUs within domain relationship
OUs name different domain independent
The name appears represent single organization multiple unit department within organization
However OUs always follow model
They might represent geographical region association external group technology used relation object
Examples would include In AD organizational unit OU contain unit including OUs user group computer
Organizational unit separate Domains may identical name independent
OUs let administrator group computer user apply common policy
Organizational Units give hierarchical structure properly designed ease administration
supplied two largest software directory system
Each company started flat account directory structure encountered support limitation inherent flat structure
They adopted OU concept software around Novell release subsequently known eDirectory Lotus release third version Lotus Notes
Microsoft allegedly used Novell directory blueprint first released version AD claim appears suspect given served granddaddy directory system

I want find specific OU computer belongs C
I code get information I need feel robust would require complicated parsing
Are better alternative
Thoughts
Any help appreciated
Really I want equivilent command prompt command But I need C proving problematic
Here solution using namespace The Linq treatment machine distinguished name split component element skip element first element recombines leaving distinguished name containing OU
The class namespace provide fairly abstraction various type security principal account

Active Directory allows administrator create hierarchy within domain meet need organization
The object class choice building hierarchy class container used group object class together administrative purpose
An organizational unit Active Directory analogous directory file system container hold object
Organizational unit nested create hierarchy within domain form logical administrative unit user group resource object printer computer application file share
The organizational unit hierarchy within domain independent structure domain domain implement hierarchy
Likewise domain managed central authority implement similar organizational unit hierarchy
The structure completely flexible allows organization create environment mirror administrative model whether centralized decentralized
For information planning implementing organizational unit hierarchy see Designing Active Directory Structure
Group Policy applied organizational unit define ability group computer user contained within organizational unit
Levels control range complete desktop lockdown relatively autonomous user experience
Group Policy affect functionality application available group user feature within application accessible particular computer document saved access user permission
Group Policy also affect application operating system update special script applied
Group Policy setting stored Group Policy object Active Directory
A Group Policy object associated one Active Directory container site domain organizational unit
For information Group Policy see book
The WindowsÂ security model implement default access control propagated particular subtree container object
You use technology determine security entire group object according security set organizational unit contains object effectively delegate administrative control individual organization
The best way take full advantage delegation inherited control directory object organize hierarchy match way directory administered
Because Active Directory indexed need organize tree ease browsing likely run counter administrative objective
Administrative control directory object applied delegated organizational unit access control
For information administrative control see Delegation Administration later chapter

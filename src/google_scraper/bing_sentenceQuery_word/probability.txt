Math important part computer science
But math important
An overview math topic useful CS outlined
This branch mathematics mainly concerned us set integer discrete separate object one another
The phrase coined math topic useful computer science student evolved study think problem solving real world using mathematical therefore computational model
Discrete math topic often concerned reasoning number many class begin logical statement mathematical proof induction important ability prove something true infinite amount data using two finite step
When designing program run potentially million machine around world help feel confident algorithm logic designed work correctly matter environment run
Discrete math certainly numerical topic well
The study summation closed algorithmic form help algorithmic optimization use notation working matrix vector give introduction logic needed work large set ordered data program
When company Google Yahoo first developing internet algorithm turned graph theory another major component discrete math
Graphs used model relationship object set object
They also used model practically algorithmic problem defined problem graph solve graph operation like traversal checking connectivity circularity
Discrete math broad term defined way group important topic math needed computer science
The exposure student topic better able handle challenge software engineering
If taken calculus class perhaps even advanced algebra class may exposed discrete math topic
Probability study odds particular event occur
This area math often grouped discrete math title strong presence outside computer world well
Probability play large role determining predict way computer program act
Consider algorithm sort number descending order
Predicting fast algorithm run depends multiple factor way algorithm designed could result different speed considering data set scenario
Probability help determine odds data coming algorithm best worst case ordering guide best solution
A good software engineer question everything come design probability theory excellent tool helping ask question

Consider experiment produce number result
The collection possible result called sample space experiment
The sample space formed considering different collection possible result
For example rolling dice produce six possible result
One collection possible result give odd number dice
Thus subset element sample space dice roll
These collection called event
In case event dice fall odd number
If result actually occur fall given event event said occurred
A probability every event value zero one requirement event made possible result example event assigned value one
To qualify probability assignment value must satisfy requirement look collection mutually exclusive event event common result event mutually exclusive probability least one event occur given sum probability individual event

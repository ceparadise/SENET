A metamodel surrogate model model model metamodeling process generating metamodels
Thus analysis construction development frame rule constraint model theory applicable useful predefined class problem
As name implies concept applies notion modeling
Metamodels many type diverse application
A thorough discussion presented following text
A metamodel surrogate model model model
simplified model actual model circuit system software like entity
Metamodel mathematical relation algorithm representing input output relation
A abstraction phenomenon metamodel yet another abstraction highlighting property model
A model conforms metamodel way computer program conforms grammar programming language written
Various type metamodels include polynomial equation neural network etc
Metamodeling construction collection concept thing term etc
within certain domain
Metamodeling typically involves studying output input relationship fitting right metamodels represent behavior
Common us metamodels Because meta character metamodeling theory metamodels relevance
The concept useful practical application
The latter main focus article
In use recommended
This contrasted classical development technique
A model always conforms unique metamodel
One currently active branch approach named proposed
This approach based utilization language write metamodels called
Typical metamodels proposed SPEM CWM
also published standard metamodel
All language presented could defined MOF metamodels
type metamodeling used analysis construction model applicable useful predefined class problem

One important move systematic use
The OMG proposed standard called
based MOF
Among many MTLs example implementation standard AndroMDA
closely related
Both often used describe analyze relation concept For software engineering several model corresponding modeling activity distinguished A library similar metamodels called Zoo metamodels
There several type zoo
Some expressed ECore
Others written
The metamodels expressed may uploaded tool

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Where difference meta model design pattern
If take example Fowlers Identity Field book Patterns Of Enterprise Application Architecture Why pattern meta model
Thanks
It good practice
It considered possible solution problem may ofter occur
The solution usually come experience
Examples
It considered set rule constraint construct allow model problem
As example consider map
A map allows model reality map considered model
The metamodel map legend construct need use order represent border river lake
In case good practice decide follow
It

In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO

Another important feature ability import export foreign language
Ontologies developed specific purpose application

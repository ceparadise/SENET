In computer science task minimal set data used task may must saved allow task later continued point
The concept context assumes significance case interruptible task wherein upon interrupted processor save context proceeds serve
Thus smaller context smaller latency
The context data may located memory used task used manage task
The storage memory file used task concerned task context case even stored us checkpointing
In computer language like C also concept
For instance needed inside added since version context
Here example code The keyword prevents relocating variable
The access array like
using pointer arithmetic individual element array accessed index

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I know Process Context something stored process preempted containing necessary info restart process later time
I also know Process Control Block PCB contains necessary attribute process
So mean Process Context part PCB
Or way around
Or separate together
Please help understand one end begin well used together
What exactly process boundary
Also PCB affected context switch
I think confusing concept thread process
Processes get thread get
A process contain one thread may run concurrently
As long current thread process made paused said running
When last thread end process terminates
When process terminated forcibly operating system thread terminated well
The collection information needed define process
In modern run memory space
The term actually use operating system various info needed control process actually stored single structure term helpful
All thread inherit property process little room alter
It programmer responsibility make sure thread step others toe
Unlike process isolation thread inside process dedicated stack
A thread context part PCB
A thread context simply dumb current machine state mostly CPU register thread interrupted additon every thread get dedicated stack thread local storage
The context thread run understood term process state defined PCB

memory address inside process X make sense outside process
I never heard
I assuming mean
Every process run virtual address space get access virtual resource screen way one process access resource another process
In operating system isolation imperfect resource use application easily accessed especially process started equivalent attribute
user id
PCB affected context switch
The PCB affected thread context switch

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

A context switch procedure computer central processing unit follows change one process another ensuring task conflict
Effective context switching critical computer provide
In CPU term context refers data program counter specific moment time
A register hold current CPU
A program counter also known instruction address register small amount fast hold instruction executed immediately current one
A context switch performed entirely physical medium
Older CPUs series way
However modern CPUs perform context switch mean programming
A modern CPU perform hundred context switch per second
Therefore user get impression computer performing multiple task fashion CPU actually alternate rotates among task high rate speed

The statistic listed represent significant growing demand data scientist
Sources Data increasingly cheap ubiquitous
We digitizing analog content created century collecting myriad new type data web log mobile device sensor instrument transaction
IBM estimate percent data world today created past two year
At time new technology emerging organize make sense avalanche data
We identify pattern regularity data sort allow u advance scholarship improve human condition create commercial social value
The rise big data potential deepen understanding phenomenon ranging physical biological system human social economic behavior
Virtually every sector economy access data would imaginable even decade ago
Businesses today accumulating new data rate exceeds capacity extract value
The question facing every organization want attract community use data effectively data data available relevant
Our ability derive social economic value newly available data limited lack expertise
Working data requires distinctive new skill tool
The corpus often voluminous fit single computer manipulate traditional database statistical tool represent using standard graphic software
The data also heterogeneous highly curated data past
Digitized text audio visual content like sensor blog data typically messy incomplete unstructured often uncertain provenance quality frequently must combined data useful
Working data set also raise challenging issue privacy security ethic

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

Data computer program organised using data structure
There different method organising data
Arrays common tool used organise data programming
The key role computer program store process data

The following notation language graphical textual used describe dynamic behavior software component
Many notation useful mostly exclusively detailed design
There exist various general strategy help guide design process
In contrast general strategy method specific generally suggest provide set notation used method description process used following method set guideline using method
Such method useful mean transferring knowledge common framework team software engineer
Some example general strategy useful design process stepwise refinement strategy data abstraction information hiding use heuristic use pattern pattern language use iterative incremental approach
This one classical method software design decomposition center identifying major software function elaborating refining manner
Structured design generally used structured analysis thus producing among thing data flow diagram associated process description
Researchers proposed various strategy example transformation analysis transaction analysis heuristic example scope effect scope control transform DFD software architecture generally represented structure chart
Numerous software design method based object proposed
The field evolved early design noun object verb method adjective attribute OO design inheritance polymorphism play key role field design defined accessed reflection example
Although OO design root stem concept data abstraction design also proposed alternative approach OO design
design example Jackson start data structure program manipulates rather function performs
The software engineer first describes input output data structure using Jackson structure diagram instance develops program control structure based data structure diagram
Various heuristic proposed deal special example mismatch input output structure
A software component independent unit interface dependency composed deployed independently
design address issue related providing developing integrating component order improve reuse
Other interesting le mainstream approach also exist formal rigorous method transformational method

An often called simply intermittent malfunction device system occurs interval usually irregular device system function normally time
Intermittent fault common branch including
An intermittent fault caused several contributing factor may effectively occur simultaneously
The complex system mechanism involved greater likelihood intermittent fault
A simple example effectively random cause physical system borderline electrical connection wiring component cause must identified rectified two conductor may touch subject need identified minor change temperature vibration orientation voltage etc
Sometimes described intermittent connection rather fault
In computer software program may fail variable required initially zero program run circumstance memory always clear start malfunction rare occasion memory variable stored happens beforehand
Intermittent fault notoriously difficult identify repair individual factor create problem alone factor identified malfunction actually occurring
The person capable identifying solving problem seldom usual operator
Because timing malfunction unpredictable device system engineer time incur fault often simply tolerated frequent unless cause unacceptable problem danger
For example intermittent fault critical equipment medical equipment could result killing patient aeronautics cause flight aborted case crash
If intermittent fault occurs long enough troubleshooting identified resolved usual way
Some technique resolve intermittent fault

Abstract Intermittent fault completely missed traditional monitoring detection technique due nature signal
These incipient event precursor permanent fault come
Intermittent fault electrical interconnection short duration transient could detected specific technique provide enough information understand root cause
Due random nature intermittent fault frustrating elusive expensive fault detect interconnection system
The novel approach author injects fixed frequency sinusoidal signal electronics interconnection system modulates intermittent fault persist
Intermittent fault channel effect computed received signal demodulation spectrum analysis
This paper describes technology intermittent fault detection classification intermittent fault channel characterization
The paper also report functionally test computational system proposed method
This algorithm tested using experimental setup
It generate intermittent signal external vibration stress connector intermittency detected acquiring processing propagating signal
The result demonstrate detect classify intermittent interconnection noise variation due intermittency
Monitoring channel low amplitude narrow band signal electronics interconnection transmitter receiver provides effective tool continuously watching wire system random unpredictable intermittent fault precursor failure

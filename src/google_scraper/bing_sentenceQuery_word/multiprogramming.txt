I finding difficult clearly differentiate Multiprogramming Multitasking
My primary source WP article seems little odds le reputable source like college professor
As I read WP rudimentary way increasing CPU throughput process wait
Multiprogramming give guarantee program run timely manner
Indeed first program may well run hour without needing access peripheral
synonymous improvement multiprogramming synonymous
The CPU regularly give impression simultaneous execution process still required yield poorly designed program starve rest system
take aggressive control scheduling giving priority process others etc
They le synonymous
Multiprogramming used one CPU involved switched process process resiging memory simultaneously
Along came thread switching program anymore
Processors particularly intel line mechanism true multitasking timer interrupt privileged instruction since least
The used first Mac processor multitaking capacity
This recent development architecture
Note first time shared system swapped user program thus really multiprogramming sense several program memory time
The idea several program residing memory simultaneously one yield CPU finishing waiting others ready use CPU thus increasing CPU utilization consider CPU burst preparing use increase overall usage
This give better thoughput important batch system
Along came time sharing several interactive user connected machine
Same idea keep program around switch among fast enough ilusion computer
Requires timer interrupt CPU avoid monopolization
On personal machine much incentive run several program time least initially one user front severely limited machive expect much
As machine grew way working around allowing several program time cooperative multitasking every program suposed yield periodically operating system select another one run
As program full control select nothing could get messed others
Needless say program forgetting fullfil duty yield get interesting boost performance early Mac system worked way reason last long
On embedded system rudimentary operating system tightly controlled set program running certainly attactive option
Difference Multitasking Multiprogramming
Multi tasking logical extension multi programming
Classicaly multi programming environment one user share cpu cpu rapidly switch one user another providing complete transparency
In multitasking user substituted program one program share cpu cpu rapidly switch one program another
Actually software residing disk program
When brought RAM execution known process task inside cpu executing known thread
So multiprograaming basically multitasking single user multiple program
Since modern OS support often spell interchangibly
There lot difference multitasking multiprogramming
Multitasking executing one task single time
For example listening song printing paper typing time
While multiprogramming type OS improve CPU utilization using buffering spooling
In sequential execution CPU sits idle executing program load next program main memory
During operation cpu also sits idel CPU also sits idle using multiprogramming environment CPU switch next program process
This technique used help buffering spooling

method simultaneous execution digital computer several program related different problem
The increase processor speed memory size number data device led unequal load particular unit computer
For example arithmetic unit operate exchange data memory magnetic tape memory data device completed
While processor operating peripheral gear idle waiting data processing completed receive data output
In addition unevenness load different unit also result nature problem solved problem require input large quantity data small number computation whereas others require opposite
Multiprogramming ensures maximum load individual unit provides simultaneous operation increase overall productivity computer
During multiprogram operation computer memory hold program several problem simultaneously
If delay execution one example search segment magnetic tape raw data execution interrupted switch made supervisory program pass control next program
All data required continue execution interrupted program stored computer memory
The new program executed necessary refer peripheral gear cause delay previous program eliminated
The switch one program another may done automatically operator control console time allocated solving problem expired error computation occurred malfunction computer discovered
There two basic system multiprogram computer operation batch group processing time sharing
Batch processing involves compilation batch problem request received user processing batch sequence ensures maximum load individual unit
A batch made problem different data volume different rate exchange unit computer
The program problem fed auxiliary storage executed order
In case forced interruption program run computer switch execution next program batch elimination cause interruption interrupted program resumed
The priority request received time arrival factor considered batch processing
The batch processing mode increase computer productivity reduces equipment downtime minimum typical mode operation computer center
However batch processing efficient user point view working directly computer find correct error program quickly
The turnaround time also increase
The mode give every user impression computer working alone
Each user supplied data device display type equipment ensures interaction computer
This includes equipment us telephone line
Each user solves problem periodically machine time allocated study result prepares next assignment computer
The user ordinarily us general library program may also private archive
If general library used supervisory program plan executes forced interruption program depending user priority machine time allocated nature problem solved
The mode permit user carry effective dialogue machine convenient control system production process automatic control system enterprise sector national economy reference information service large computer center
When serving user computer may batch processing

running two program set instruction one time
Multitasking used keep computer resource work much time possible
It controlled load program computer processing oversees execution finished
Multitasking involves overlapping interleaving execution several program
This often achieved capitalizing difference computer rapid processing capacity slower rate device
While computer reading data magnetic disk fairly limited rate example powerful central processor execute high speed another program involves extensive calculation little input
Operating system coordinate competing demand various program variety way
Two program executed small computer using system computer executes instruction one program time devotes running another program higher priority
Such system make use idle time task minute delay keyboard entry execute instruction background program
In many multitasking operation computer microprocessor switch attention back forth different program fraction second
known multiprocessing multitasking system today even single program may consist many separate computational activity called process
The system must keep track active queued process process must access secondary memory retrieve store rise multiprogramming several job reside computer simultaneously share example allocated fixed amount CPU time turn
More sophisticated hardware allowed one job reading data another wrote printer still another performed computation
time multiprogramming
With multiprogramming computer interleave several program allocating various computer resource memory storage input output program operating system
Atlas also first computer employ technique known virtual memory virtual storage detailed plan procedure solving problem computer specifically unambiguous ordered sequence computational instruction necessary achieve solution
The distinction computer program equipment often made referring former software latter hardware
Programs program manages computer resource especially allocation resource among program
Typical resource include central processing unit CPU computer memory file storage device network connection
Management task include scheduling resource use avoid conflict interference program

Computer Science Research Data Code When approach operating system concept might several confusing term may look similar fact refer different concept
In post I try clarify four term often cause perplexity
In modern computing system usually several concurrent application process compete resource like instance CPU
As already introduced Operating System OS amongst duty responsible effective efficient allocation resource
Generally speaking OS module handle resource allocation called scheduler
On basis type OS realized different scheduling policy may implemented
In multiprogramming system one program loaded main memory ready execute
Only one program time able get CPU executing instruction one process running system others waiting turn
The main idea multiprogramming maximize use CPU time
Indeed suppose currently running process performing task definition need CPU accomplished
Then OS may interrupt process give control one program ready execute

In way CPU time wasted system waiting task completed running process keep executing either voluntarily release CPU block operation
Therefore ultimate goal multiprogramming keep CPU busy long process ready execute
Note order system function properly OS must able load multiple program separate area main memory provide required protection avoid chance one process modified another one
Other problem need addressed multiple program memory program enter leave main memory
Another issue need handled well large program may fit memory solved using
Please refer detail
Finally note ready process highly mostly execute CPU task none operation worst case one program might wait one complete executing
Multiprocessing sometimes refers executing multiple process program time
This might misleading already introduced term multiprogramming describe
In fact multiprocessing refers CPU unit rather running process
If underlying hardware provides one processor multiprocessing
Several variation basic scheme exist multiple core one die multiple dy one package multiple package one system
Anyway system multiprogrammed multiple program running time multiprocessing one physical processor
Multitasking meaning multiprogramming general sense refers multiple program process task thread running time
This term used modern operating system multiple task share common processing resource CPU Memory
At time CPU executing one task task waiting turn
The illusion parallelism achieved CPU reassigned another task

There subtle difference multitasking multiprogramming
A multitasking operating system whole application program also refer thread execution one process divided
Each smaller task hijack CPU finish like older multiprogramming rather fair share amount CPU time called quantum
Just make easy remember multiprogramming multitasking operating system system
However multiprogramming older OSs one program whole keep running block multitasking modern OSs time sharing best manifested running process take fair quantum CPU time
Up talked multiprogramming way allow multiple program resident main memory apparently running time
Then multitasking refers multiple task running apparently simultaneously sharing CPU time
Finally multiprocessing describes system multiple CPUs
So multithreading come
Multithreading execution model allows single process multiple code segment run concurrently within context process
You think thread child process share parent process resource execute independently
Multiple thread single process share CPU single CPU system purely run parallel multiprocessing system Why need multiple thread execution within single process context
Well consider instance GUI application user issue command require long time finish complex mathematical computation
Unless design command run separate execution thread able interact main application GUI update progress bar going unresponsive calculation taking place
Of course designing application requires programmer handle situation simply occur developing sequential application
For instance two thread try access modify shared resource programmer must sure leave system inconsistent deadlock state
Typically thread synchronization solved using OS primitive
The concept applies multiprogramming well multitasking yet different level granularity
In former context refers whole process whereas latter context may lighter thread
In fact involves switching virtual memory address space includes memory address mapping page table kernel resource
On hand context switching one thread another process
need switching virtual memory address space switcher switchee thread share virtual address space
This requires switching processor state program counter register content generally efficient
Of course switching thread thread across different process like process context switching
Very nicely thanks So I word excel ppt open machine time multi threading
I think written informatively I still kind confused multi threading part
Thanks comment Jon
What describe namely ability system multiple application
process open time generally referred
Now machine process run parallel CPU execute one instruction time given clock cycle
That said end user process running simultaneously often mean ability specific portion operating system
assign small unit CPU time process rotating fashion like
In way CPU executes segment multiple task interleaved manner context switch one process another overall appear run simultaneously
As roughly think extension idea within individual task process
Indeed way multiple process MS Word MS Excel Chrome etc
competing CPU main memory within task MS Word may multiple thread sharing process state memory open file etc
thread responsible specific lightweight task receiving input data stdin processing data persisting data etc
For explanation please refer
Hope help
Thank Gabriele

I little confused three term Multitasking Multithreading Multiprogramming Although every one mean executing different line code every one need something like Task State Segment context store data particular
I missing something anyone give basic difference actually executed processor Actually I guy Electronics background I poor OS related issue
The main thing I understood multiprogramming multithreading multiprogramming execute two separate program multithreading scheduler produce two different thread executed independently
I think form multitasking implementation
Am I correct
I really confused The Wikipedia article cover well
In summary Multitasking term mean computer system allowed multiple task
Multitasking nothing say actually implemented even implemented single threaded program
Multithreading multiprogramming form able execute multiple task
The difference multithreading multiprogramming level isolation thread program thread multithreaded system share common memory address space program multiprogram system independent communicate explicit IPC

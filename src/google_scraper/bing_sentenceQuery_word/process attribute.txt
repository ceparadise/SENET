In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
Get FREE access day create account
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

Inconsistency naming convention
Attribute selection preprocessing step learning generally involves combination search attribute utility estimation
When evaluation selected feature respect learning algorithm considered well lead large number possible permutation
An attribute selection important reduce time data cleaning process
An attribute selection algorithm effective reducing attribute removing irrelevant attribute increasing speed data cleaning process improving result clarity
CLASSIFICATION OF ATTRIBUTES The attribute classified unpredictive
Unpredictive attribute futile irrelevant predicting class
They discarded feature selection method prior learning
Predictive attribute useful predicting class among predictable one predicted class attribute unpredictable one

STEPS TO CLEAN THE DATA WAREHOUSE The first step Scrub dirty data field
This step attempt remove typographical error abbreviation data
b The second step Sort token data field
Characters string grouped meaningful piece called token sorted
c The third step Sort record
This step sort record based token value
The fourth step Comparison record
A window fixed size moved sorted record limit comparison matching record
e The final step merging matching record
Matching record treated partial source information merged obtain record complete information

ATTRIBUTE SELECTION CRITERIA An attribute selection process chooses best attribute according certain criterion
This attribute selection algorithm used increase speed improve accuracy data cleaning process removing redundant irrelevant attribute form data warehouse
There three criterion used identify relevant attribute data cleaning process
Identifying key attribute The key attribute set attribute uniquely identify specific instance table
Every table data model must primary key whose value uniquely identify instance key may primary key candidate key foreign key composite key
ii Classifying distinct missing value Missing character value always matter whether expressed one blank one blank
Distinct used retrieve number row unique value attribute
The accuracy result poor low distinct value high missing value
Identification power attribute j ipj distinct equivalence Classes total record Total number record The distinct value used calculate Identification power attribute
An Identification power attribute ipj used evaluate discriminating power record attribute iii Classifying type attribute There four type attribute nominal ordinal interval ratio
The different criterion given attribute type
The value measurement type also considered attribute selection
The data cleaning numeric data effective
The categorical data efficient data cleaning process
SELECTION ALGORITHM AND ANALYSIS An attribute selection algorithm work according specified constraint select attribute data cleaning process
Attribute selection algorithm Input
tuples n relation instance r Initialize L Temporary relation instance Output S Selected attribute high threshold value Ïƒ For attribute xi begin Select key attribute put ii Select attribute collectively Super key put iii Calculate threshold Ïƒ Ïƒ D M S
Distinct D value attribute xi tuple ti b
Missing M value attribute xi tuple ti NULL Measurement type MT attribute Ordinal nominal interval Ratio xi Size S attribute xi Put iv Select attribute high threshold value Ïƒ put v Ignore attribute low threshold value end This attribute selection algorithm first selects relation schema R including N attribute
Then chooses relation instance table r relation schema Finally selects attribute Ai AN Of relation schema R including N attribute
This attribute selection algorithm obtains temporary relation schema L attribute name type size missing value distinct value Measurement type Threshold value
For attribute read relation tuples record selected relation instance r find count missing target value attribute Ai calculate percentage value
These percentage value missing value stored temporary relation instance Then find count distinct target value attribute Ai calculate percentage value
These percentage value missing value stored temporary relation instance Finally find measurement type attribute Ai put temporary relation instance L attribute Ai
The threshold value calculated every target attribute Ai based missing value distinct value measurement type put threshold value attribute temporary relation instance Finally select attribute S temporary relation L based threshold value next step data cleaning process

ALGORITHM FOR TOKEN FORMATION The token formed selected attribute field highest rank

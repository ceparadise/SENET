basic unit information storage processing
A byte consists digit consists
The string bit making byte processed unit computer byte smallest operable unit storage computer
A byte represent equivalent single character letter B comma percentage sign represent number
Because byte contains little information processing storage capacity computer hardware usually given gigabyte GB one billion byte terabyte TB one trillion byte
Because byte root binary digit originally one kilobyte byte byte thus one megabyte MB byte
However notable exception computer industry switched decimal prefix prefix denote thousandfold increase byte
bit called byte
group called byte
Because digital computer use byte ASCII code commonly embedded field consisting seven information bit parity bit used purpose represent special symbol
The use system device processing storing displaying information
meant person computation term almost universally refers automated electronic machinery
code used digital computer based binary number system two possible state usually symbolized
Whereas decimal system employ digit digit position represents power etc
communication information theory unit information equivalent result choice two possible alternative binary number system generally used digital computer
The term shortened word binary It also applied We welcome suggested improvement article

I watched youtube bit
After watching I confusion actual size number string character take
What I understood video
bit bit bit

I want know given statement expect decimal point correct
numeric string character take byte
I using bit operating system
And binary code decimal value If I understand correctly asking many used represent given number character
I try cover common case Since system use per byte number usually represented multiple bit Each successive bit used represent value twice size previous one first bit represents one second bit represents two third represents four
If bit set value represents added total value number whole value
Note even number still represent number
For example The zero first number used distinguish second even set
An unsigned variable represent value range inclusive
Signed value
number negative often described using single bit indicate whether value positive negative would give effective range either way since much point two different way represent zero commonly used allow slightly greater storage range
Numbers usually represented
A IEEE floating point value us bit like typical value
I suggest reading Wikipedia article interested technical detail work I hope like mathematics
Alternatively number may represented using format fairly common occurrence early day DOS gaming became standard feature desktop machine fixed point arithmetic still used today situation
Simple ASCII text usually represented series byte word series integer numeric value representing single character code
For example value represents ASCII space character
Alternative encoding map number value different visible character whilst yet encoding may use value character instead
Unicode character set complicated single character might represented value value whilst character anywhere byte byte
You also aware value spanning single byte typically one two way endian endian
You may also hear representation see information
There difference bit byte
bit single digit base
byte bit
Yes statement gave correct
Binary code
However interpret binary
The way computer store number different based compiler platform
For example C us IEEE format
Google learn
Your OS bit mean CPU architecture bit
bit one binary digit byte eight bit two hex digit A Nibble half byte hex digit Words get bit complex
Originally number byte required cover range address available memory
As lot hybrid memory scheme
Word usually double word byte etc
In computing everything come binary combination
Characters decimal number etc representation
So character bit ascii binary hex decimal base number
It choose single byte character
Representing number decimal point even varied
There many accepted way convention rule
Have look complement gray code BCD floating point representation get idea

Want watch later
A term use describe basic unit information used computer
You probably wait
I thought computer used
And right
Computers use bit
However bear mind lowly computer bit describe one two thing like light switch true false forth
There whole lot
So use byte bit basic chunk information computer
A byte group bit allows whole lot ever could
Think like row light switch kitchen use control stuff
Can imagine number combination switch either
You
Did guess
Terrific
That gon na kitchen lighting system
What byte anyway
It turn good reason
So brilliant guy way back Werner Buchholz decided could barely fit number needed plus thing like letter punctuation computer bit tell business machine
Today call ASCII
He wanted call metaphor computer chewing
To avoid confusion used instead computer byte born
Some say byte stand sort like pixel stand probably came fact
Usually mundane explanation real deal
How know
Well amazing guy named Bob Bemer knew worked wrote trivia u motto Two Magic
Bob wanted call byte
But know catchy word catch first octet sound like Dixieland band size
Hey want look way back folk using bit program loom using punched paper textile industry hundred year
But enough even though needed bit got happens power
Gee I sounding like old Audi engine commercial many
So probably saying byte make special
Let quick math lesson
Do worry easy
Most u use base numbering system digit also called decimal system
Computers use number system digit
We use base count finger toe
Since computer whole lot easier count instead
But binary work exactly like decimal system
Each possible whatever exists number system although group usually using column
So u magical number written In decimal column left power greater one right
The far right column next left
So moving right left get
But since computer use column like That
Now see work byte hold bit column left power greater one right
So moving right left get We skipped leftmost bit
In total bit represent different combination
Get FREE access day create account
Now fun part group bit chunk also group byte
That mostly see word like kilobyte byte megabyte million byte le
Here chart many measure often see using computer unit measurement humble byte No doubt wondering kilobyte
In information system everything based power binary
So
However sometimes use International System Units SI really
How tell
If see data transfer rate fast typically base see storage size much typically base
Tada
You learned byte
Shall review
First defined byte basic unit information used computer conventionally representing bit information
A bit one two thing like light switch byte one different thing like number letter anything
Werner Buchholz coined term byte back conveniently describe much information computer could time
Computers use byte even though human use decimal number system count finger toe computer use binary number system computer brainy much way body count
Bytes grouped together symbolize really large number example kilobyte kbytes megabyte MB gigabyte GB
Now something really amazing chew

These called character set
A byte abbreviated uppercase B
A represented lowercase b
While byte hold letter symbol bit smallest unit storage storing one binary digit
The standard number bit byte eight number vary system system depending
Fred Brooks early hardware architect project manager IBM author credit Werner Buchholz originating term working IBM STRETCH computer
Initially could one six bit byte equipment time used piece information
The change eight bit byte occurred later year circulating new standard
Another unit data representing eight bit
Unlike byte octet always consists eight bit matter architecture
Octets measurement used avoid possible ambiguity associated byte particularly legacy system term often used synonymously
A quadbit refers four bit half standard
While byte measured bit multiple computer storage typically measured byte multiple
In many computer architecture byte smallest addressable unit memory
For example megabyte hard drive hold nominal million byte data
Due massive increase storage capacity time eight additional unit measurement following byte
The eight different type byte currently used computer architecture range byte
Byte multiple measured using two system
A binary system commonly expressed rounded decimal number
One megabyte million byte actually made byte definition
A system state byte computer storage calculated
In system MB would actually million decimal byte
This system common among manufacturer consumer
While difference system fairly insignificant capacity increased discrepancy widened considerably

So computer use binary number therefore use place decimal digit
The word shortening word Binary digIT
Whereas decimal digit possible value ranging bit two possible value
Therefore binary number composed like
How figure value binary number
You way use base instead base
So You see binary number bit hold value increasing power
That make counting binary pretty easy
Starting zero going counting decimal binary look like When look sequence decimal binary number system
At number see carrying first take place binary system

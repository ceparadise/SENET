At work use three ThinkSafe step help prevent accident
A hazard anything could hurt someone else
Examples workplace hazard include During work experience must remain alert anything may dangerous
If see hear smell anything odd take note
If think could hazard tell someone
Assessing risk mean working likely hazard harm someone serious harm could
Whenever spot hazard ass risk asking two question Always tell someone employer supervisor health safety representative hazard ca fix especially hazard could cause serious harm anyone
For example If sure safest way something work experience always ask work experience supervisor
It employer responsibility fix hazard
Sometimes may able fix simple hazard long put others risk
For example pick thing floor put away eliminate trip hazard
The best way fix hazard get rid altogether
This always possible employer try make hazard le dangerous looking following option order effective least effective Sometimes require one risk control measure effectively reduce exposure hazard

Hazard identification ongoing process critical component health safety program
A common approach process use principle industrial hygiene recognize evaluate control employee exposure workplace hazard
The hazard identification process applicable range workplace hazard type resulting benefit employee health safety environmental protection concern
Regardless workplace hazard goal utilizing hazard identification include Potential challenge facing health safety professional include defining unacceptable practical
Recognition administrator management staff hazard identification process requiring continued review also crucial meeting goal achieving overall program success
The type hazard found today vary significantly workplace covering array exposure concern anthracis spore anthrax zinc oxide fume
Safety hazard concern virtually workplace clearly identified controlled
From industrial hygiene perspective material noise usually prevalent
Other exposure hazard evolving particularly biological threat
This illustrated current concern mold occupational residential setting recent concern anthracis exposure mailroom employee
Exposure concern health safety professional continually searching effective control strategy
Chemical biological hazard also impact environmental protection
Clear identification characterization waste stream minimize employee exposure environmental concern
Fugitive process emission lead dust fume within plant present immediate employee health risk inhalation exposure future environmental risk accumulation toxic material equipment building surface
In case OSHA compliance benchmark foundation health safety program
Regardless specific OSHA standard health safety professional certainly want control hazard within considered legally acceptable
Controlling exposure employee comfort productivity approach may le common usually different level OSHA compliance
The typical scenario includes workplace exposure outside normal range expected
Indoor air quality issue based employee complaint fall category
In situation employee may comment temperature hotter colder usual lighting different unrecognizable odor issue
The resulting investigation usually find OSHA compliance violation certainly may lead loss productivity
Many similar situation common today workplace
OSHA recognized importance employee comfort issue recent standard development voluntary use provision respirator standard CFR
As employee equate discomfort adverse health effect controlling workplace hazard comfort productivity perspective may important meeting OSHA compliance
The practice industrial hygiene utilizes recognition evaluation approach hazard identification
The American Industrial Hygiene Association AIHA describes industrial hygiene science art
As science much conclusion drawn based observation fact experimentation
As art involves judgement creativity human interaction
The hazard identification process dependent upon science art aspect
The hazard recognition phase involves basic characterization information gathering
Hazard recognition sometimes like performing detective work
The health safety professional find exposure hazard obvious high noise level others obvious determining cause employee health complaint
In either case hazard recognition attempt gather existing information exposure
Many method tool resource available completing hazard recognition phase including The survey use observational skill sens hearing smelling gather information particular process task
monitoring equipment sound level meter may used qualify hazard evaluation
Most data collection however reserved hazard evaluation phase
interview attempt capture personal aspect hazard present
Records review may look process flow diagram exposure monitoring data environmental report SOPs job hazard analysis document
Standards review consider applicable exposure limit OSHA PELs performance standard OSHA ANSI etc
Finally literature review material safety data sheet toxicology provide significant amount information concerning hazard
The evaluation phase attempt determine degree severity hazard
This accomplished using process includes An assessment measurement exposure Comparison measured exposure benchmark used permissible exposure limit Determination whether risk acceptable The first step may may include actual exposure data collection
For example record review process identified previous employee exposure PEL contaminant additional monitoring may necessary
In case health safety professional must use acquired skill judgment determine whether data reliable representative
Comparison measured exposure benchmark also present challenge exposure limit established performance guideline published define safe level
Biological hazard mold often present greatest challenge area
Other criterion history complaint comparison problem area data clean area data often necessary instance
Determination whether risk acceptable often depends generally accepted benchmark used
management staff example may likely accept understand use OSHA PEL benchmark rather ACGIH TLV industry guideline stringent
Implementation control strategy last phase considered hazard identification process
Control strategy must always consider minimum OSHA compliance requirement
However recognizing employee comfort vital element also important
Best practice controlling exposure hazard includes hierarchy preferred method including least preferred Engineering control process enclosure local exhaust ventilation Administrative control including employee training good housekeeping Personal protective equipment PPE respiratory protection hearing protection eye head protection Regardless method selected practical simple consideration following help minimize future problem The final element hazard identification recognition process
The following situation describe exposure hazard When change process task hazard originally occurred
When monitoring sampling result inconclusive uncertainty exposure
After control strategy implemented determine validate effectiveness
In conclusion hazard identification complex process
Careful consideration legal requirement accumulated process information data program goal help assure employee company need met

Conclusions work given final paper

In domain CPU problem CPU next instruction execute following clock cycle potentially lead incorrect computation result
Three common type hazard data hazard structural hazard control flow hazard branching hazard
There several method used deal hazard including bubbling case method
pipelined processor performed several stage given time several instruction processed various stage pipeline fetch execute
There many different instruction pipeline instruction may
A hazard occurs two simultaneous possibly order instruction conflict
Data hazard occur instruction exhibit modify data different stage pipeline
Ignoring potential data hazard result also termed race hazard
There three situation data hazard occur Consider two instruction occurring program order
try read source writes A read write RAW data hazard refers situation instruction refers result yet calculated retrieved
This occur even though instruction executed prior instruction prior instruction processed partly pipeline
For example The first instruction calculating value saved register second going use value compute result register
However operand fetched operation result first yet saved hence data dependency occurs
A data dependency occurs instruction dependent completion instruction
try write destination read A write read WAR data hazard represents problem concurrent execution
For example In situation chance may finish concurrent execution must ensured result register stored chance fetch operand
try write operand written A write write WAW data hazard may occur environment
For example The write back WB must delayed finish executing
A structural hazard occurs part processor hardware needed two instruction time
A canonical example single memory unit accessed fetch stage instruction retrieved memory memory stage data written read memory
They often resolved separating component unit separate cache
Branching hazard also termed control hazard occur
On many instruction pipeline microarchitectures processor know outcome branch need insert new instruction pipeline normally stage
also termed method preclude data structural branch hazard
As instruction fetched control logic determines whether hazard occur
If true control logic insert pipeline
Thus next instruction would cause hazard executes prior one sufficient time finish prevent hazard
If number equal number stage pipeline processor cleared instruction proceed free hazard
All form stalling introduce delay processor resume execution
occurs branch instruction jump new memory location invalidating prior stage pipeline
These prior stage cleared allowing pipeline continue new instruction indicated branch
There several main solution algorithm used resolve data hazard In case algorithm used The task removing data dependency delegated compiler fill appropriate number instruction dependent instruction ensure correct operation instruction possible
For example write value register already contains add register store result register
Following execution register contain value
However Instruction write register fully exit pipeline Instruction start executing mean Register contain value Instruction performs addition
In event Instruction add old value register register contains instead
This error occurs Instruction read Register Instruction result write operation Register
So Instruction reading content Register register still contains
Forwarding described help correct error depending fact output Instruction used subsequent instruction value committed Register
Forwarding applied example mean The effect Instruction us correct recent value Register made immediately pipelined
With forwarding enabled stage pipeline two input value read register specified example value Register new value Register example value sent next stage
Added control logic used determine input use
To avoid control hazard microarchitectures In event branch cause pipeline bubble incorrect instruction entered pipeline care must taken prevent instruction effect processor state excluding energy wasted processing discovered loaded incorrectly
Memory latency another factor designer must attend delay could reduce performance
Different type memory different accessing time memory
Thus choosing suitable type memory designer improve performance pipelined data path

Healthy Safe Productive Lives When refer hazard relation occupational safety health commonly used definition The term Hazard Risk often used interchangeably simple example explains difference two
If spill water room water would present slipping hazard person passing
If access area prevented physical barrier hazard would remain though risk would minimised
When refer risk relation occupational safety health commonly used definition The level risk often categorised upon potential harm adverse health effect hazard may cause number time person exposed number person exposed
For example exposure airborne asbestos fibre always classified high single exposure may cause potentially fatal lung disease whereas risk associated using display screen short period could considered low potential harm adverse health effect minimal
Control measure include action taken reduce potential exposure hazard control measure could remove hazard reduce likelihood risk exposure hazard realised
A simple control measure would secure guarding moving part machinery eliminating potential contact
When look control measure often refer hierarchy control measure
Risk Assessment severity Hazard potential outcome considered conjunction factor including level exposure number person exposed risk hazard realised
There number different formula used calculate overall risk basic calculation using high medium low category complicated algorithm calculate risk Nuclear power station high risk work location
It important ensure residual risk following implementation control measure low reasonably possible ALARP
For risk ALARP must possible demonstrate cost involved reducing risk would grossly disproportionate benefit gained

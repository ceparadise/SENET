Software testing important technique achieving degree software quality
It account anything development cost Hailpern Santhanarn
The three main type activity associated software testing test case generation test execution involving use test case software test SUT evaluation test result
A key task associated test case generation obtaining effective test set
The existence ease use test oracle key issue associated evaluation test result
Owing immense input space exhaustive testing impossible
Thus test case generation ensuring adequacy well effectiveness detecting defect software important
This testing SUT effective test set imply correctness possible input
Existing approach test case design categorized involving use form specification test case derived logic implemented program
Test case generation black box testing typically involves exercising set rule procedure found method equivalence class partitioning graph input domain whereas white box testing typically involved finding test data execute specific yet executed element program statement branch path
In order reduce cost labour time well improve quality software extensive testing would require automation testing process
However current status test automation primarily deal automatic execution test input code instrumentation coverage measurement
While many available commercial test execution tool specifically address issue test case design
A formal specification required significant automation test case generation
The task test case design still largely hence costly automation still much infancy McMinn
Test case created selected basis test adequacy criterion considered effective discovering fault given SUT
Given testing criterion
execution specific statement program task test case generation find input satisfy criterion
However may possible determine whether input exists
Given limited resource application technique problem automatic test case generation promising approach provide solution
Lam Robey Li presented survey application Artificial Intelligence AI software testing
McMinn comprehensive survey also presented similar finding showing focus existing work search based software testing involved use genetic algorithm GA concentrated structural testing little done address functional testing
GAs also used temporal behaviour testing SEMINAL Network Harman Jones stated comparison purely random test data generation technique approach incorporating GAs shown substantial improvement
Other AI technique used test data generation included Ant Colony Optimisation ACO Li Lam Lam Xiao Li AI planner approach Howe Mayrhauser Mraz Simulated Annealing SA Tracey Clark Mander McDermid
Some previous work involving application functional testing involved work Jones Sthamer Eyres using Z specification Tracey tested conformance Pascal program specification using SA GA

QA process type base test case specification software component test
Functions tested feeding input examining output internal program structure rarely considered unlike
Functional testing usually describes system
Functional testing imply testing function method module class
Functional testing test slice functionality whole system
Functional testing differs functional testing program checking design document specification system testing program checking published user system requirement Kaner Falk Nguyen
Functional testing many type Functional testing typically involves six step

learn share knowledge build career
What difference unit test functional test
Can unit test also test function
Unit Test testing individual unit method function class dependency mocked
Functional Test AKA Integration Test testing slice functionality system
This test many method may interact dependency like Databases Web Services
Unit test tell developer code thing right functional test tell developer code
You read A well explained analogy unit testing functional testing described follows Many time development system likened building house
While analogy quite correct extend purpose understanding difference unit functional test
Unit testing analogous building inspector visiting house construction site
He focused various internal system house foundation framing electrical plumbing
He ensures test part house work correctly safely meet building code
Functional test scenario analogous homeowner visiting construction site
He assumes internal system behave appropriately building inspector performing task
The homeowner focused like live house
He concerned house look various room comfortable size house fit family need window good spot catch morning sun
The homeowner performing functional test house
He user perspective
The building inspector performing unit test house
He builder perspective
As summary Unit Tests written perspective
They made ensure particular method class performs set specific task
Functional Tests written perspective
They ensure system user expecting
A unit test test
What unit behavior
It smallest piece system independently unit tested
This definition actually circular IOW really definition seems work quite well practice understand intuitively
A functional test test independent piece functionality
A unit behavior small I absolutely dislike stupid one unit test per method mantra perspective right
A unit behavior something part method maybe couple method
At object one
A piece functionality usually comprises many method cut across several object often multiple architectural layer
A unit test would something like I call function pas country code return
A functional test would I fill shipping form country code I redirected help page allows pick country code menu
Unit test written developer developer developer perspective
Functional test may user facing case written developer together user maybe right tool right user even user user user perspective
Or may developer facing
describe internal piece functionality user care case written developer developer still user perspective
In former case functional test may also serve acceptance test executable encoding functional requirement functional specification latter case may also serve integration test
Unit test change frequently functional test never change within major release
TLDR To answer question Unit Testing Functional Testing
There two big group Testing
The best illustration I found one source testing small snippet code
It may considered functional testing
When function put together create module standalone piece possibly User Interface tested Module Testing
Once least two separate module glue together come put two piece sub module sub system together see play nicely together
Then integrate module whatever order team see fit jigsaw piece placed together come testing SW whole
This pretty much Integration testing piece together
If OK come build customer asked actually
last stage realise customer wanted sportscar built van
Functional test mean testing function method code
It mean generally testing system functionality I run command line line become reversed perhaps
In contrast single unit test generally cover single case single method return return

According ISTQB two comparable
Functional testing integration testing
Unit test one test level functional testing type testing
Basically The function system component
This typically described requirement specification functional specification use case
Component testing also known unit module program testing search defect verifies functioning software
module program object class etc
separately testable
According ISTQB test functional Component testing may include testing functionality specific characteristic
memory leak performance robustness testing well structural testing
decision coverage
Quotes The way I think like A unit test establishes code intended code
wanted add parameter b fact add subtract functional test test code work together get correct result intended code fact get right result system
The basic distinction though functional test test application outside point view user
Unit test test application inside point view programmer
Functional test help build application right functionality guarantee never accidentally break
Unit test help write code clean bug free
Unit testing includes testing smallest unit code usually function method
Unit testing mostly done developer understand core function
The main goal developer cover code unit test
It limitation function tested unit test
Even successful completion unit test guarantee correct operation product
The function used part system unit test written one usage
It type Black Box testing testing done functional aspect product without looking code
Functional testing mostly done dedicated Software tester
It include positive negative BVA technique using un standardized data testing specified functionality product
Test coverage conducted improved manner functional test unit test
It us application GUI testing easier determine exactly specific part interface responsible rather determine code function responsible
Unit testing particularly used test product component component specially product development
Junit Nunit type tool also help test product per Unit
solving issue Integration always comfortable get resolved early development
Functional Testing As Testing concerned two main type Testing Test Test
Test test Tester test The product perform quality attribute customer mention quality attribute
Like Usability Security Load Stress etc
The customer already present requirement properly documented The tester task Cross check whether Application Functionality performing according Proposed System
For purpose Tester test Implemented functionality proposed System
AFAIK unit testing NOT functional testing
Let explain small example
You want test login functionality email web app working user would
For functional test like
Should functional test check login invalid input
Eg
Email symbol username one dot one dot permitted appears etc

Generally
That kind testing go unit test
You check invalid input rejected inside unit test shown test
Notice functional test actually unit test
Sometimes functional test repeat testing done unit test different reason
In example use functional test check particular entering invalid input
We want test bad input rejected
That job unit test
usually done developer
The objective make sure code work properly
General rule thumb cover path code using unit testing

The fulfillment requirement user major aim software development
Improper specification design lead high cost implementation phase Kuhn
Therefore software system formally specified using one specification language namely OCL Z B VBM alloy etc
In general testing activity effective applied initial stage software development
Furthermore formal specification system serf oracle medium generate functional test case
Thus great demand specification based testing field formal specification based software development
OCL found major application precise software modeling Cabot Gogolla
However proposed approach extends application OCL testing
Hence delayed fault failure detection increase cost error correction maintenance Frank Alla Robert
In paper SUT would mean OCL specification system derived requirement specification
In proposed approach mutation testing performed
based testing preferable due following reason OCL constraint easily derived requirement specification SUT
OCL describes model system precisely hence OCL based functional test result accurate
Test scenario designed effectively
Intermediate representation concretization OCL predicate require le effort
Metrics extracted easily OCL expression design test path
In approach test scenario obtained transforming OCL predicate equivalent size abstract effective reasoning
Then mutant automatically generated method SUT applying fault class Tai Vouk Paradkar Lu namely Boolean Operator Fault BOOF Incorrect Relational Operator Fault IROF Incorrect Parenthesis Fault ICPF Incorrect Boolean Variable Fault IBVF Incorrect Arithmetic Expression Fault IAEF
In proposed approach test path generated based Direct Class Coupling DCC metric Bansiya Davis value derived OCL expression SUT
The proposed algorithm used CSA algorithm generate efficient test case
In paper test adequacy criterion based branch coverage mutation score used evaluate fitness function
The following major merit proposed framework Defining fault class OCL predicate Structural refinement OCL expression simple predicate
Test path generation using DCC metric value
Efficient test data generation using CSA
For purpose work term specification condition constraint expression used interchangeably
On line testing would also mean mutation testing testing
Similarly component would mean class SUT
The remainder paper start related earlier work elaborates background proposed OCL testing
Then discus proposed algorithm present proof proposed algorithm implementation
Prior concluding proposed work compared earlier work
Prior study show various technique available generate test case OCL specification system

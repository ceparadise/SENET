From September every undergraduate course one year duration Key Information Set KIS
The KIS allows compare piece information individual course different higher education institution
However please note superficially similar course often different structure objective teaching support learning environment best suit determined identifying interest need expectation goal comparing detailed information
We recommend look thoroughly course University information contained webpage consider coming visit u Open Day rather relying solely statistical comparison
You may find following note helpful considering information presented KIS
The KIS relies superficially similar course coded way
Whilst work one level lead anomaly
For example Music course Music Technology course exactly code despite different programme quite distinct educational career outcome
Any course combine several discipline many course Cambridge tends compared nationally course one discipline case KIS comparison may accurate fair reflection reality either
For example may find considering degree embrace range discipline biology physic chemistry geology instance Natural Sciences Cambridge comparison provided course institution primarily focus one smaller combination subject
The list exhaustive may important factor relevant choice making hope useful starting point help delve deeper face value KIS data

Computer science education getting something fresh look state local policymakers many starting push new measure broaden student access subject
Seventeen state District Columbia policy place allow computer science count mathematics science credit rather elective high number rise
Wisconsin Alabama Maryland adopted policy since December Idaho legislative measure awaiting final action
At least eight state process reviewing proposal similar legislative regulatory change
The amazing thing level policy change increasing diversity regional political happening said Cameron Wilson chief operating officer computer science advocacy group
These red state blue state embracing
In January Texas lawmaker approved legislation would allow student take computer science course satisfy move alarmed computing advocate say denies computer science deep root math science
Several state including Kentucky New Mexico considering similar approach
In addition large urban district getting action
The Chicago Broward County system finding way bring computer science course student school next academic year
There widespread agreement recent surge public interest around computer science education partly triggered hip marketing campaign
The nonprofit sponsored December Hour Code initiative get million student spend least one hour learning skill
According million student participated
A data point frequently cited million job computing field college computer science major fill
The group also say percent high school United States currently offer computer computer science advocate indicate best guess
We know sure really low exact number said Chris Stephenson executive director New York Computer Science Teachers Association group advocate increased access computer science education
According recent state data College Board administers Advanced Placement program single student took AP computer science test Wyoming
Just one student took exam last year Mississippi student took test Montana
Barbara Ericson director computing outreach senior research scientist Georgia Institute Technology Atlanta examined data
For instance student took exam total state Hispanic student took eight state
Fewer percent overall female three state female
Alison Derbenwick Miller vice president philanthropic arm information technology giant Oracle provides computer science curriculum school teacher called access computer science issue
In future student understanding computing computer science wo able get job job wo exist said
estimate percent job currently computing
Proponents teaching computer CSTA defines study computer algorithmic process including hardware software working behind scene broaden access high school level two decade
The interest seeing culmination lot people working really hard lot year said Derbenwick Miller
Groups Association Computer Machinery Computing Core laying foundational policy work
The NSF began investing computer science curriculum year ago part effort get computer science teacher high school
Then year ago funded list corporate donor including Google Microsoft Hadi Ali Partovi kicked campaign video featuring basketball star Chris Bosh Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg musician among celebrity explaining importance learning code
The video went viral viewed million time YouTube
The recent economic recession also turned public attention preparing student future employability
Those factor created perfect storm said Stephenson CSTA
All sudden computer science reached level public consciousness legislator started pay attention
Washington state appeared kick new round policy activity May Gov
Jay Inslee Democrat allowing student earn math science credit toward graduation taking computer science course
Several state quickly followed suit including Wisconsin Alabama Maryland according Computing Core
David Evans executive director National Science Teachers Association declined comment whether group support opposes particular policy allow computer science count math science credit
He said Schools district encouraged offer student best course prepare college workforce includes computer science course
However said proposition take computer science another core course
The January would add computer science core subject rather elective
The Broward County district Florida
Texas took different part larger piece legislation lawmaker included provision would allow existing computer science course fulfill requirement
Stephenson devoted career improving computer science education said Texas brand legislation worrisome mainly perpetuates misconception coding computer science
A coding language tool computer science course said
It like saying multiplication part tool set math learn math multiplication
Wilson adamantly legislation
It hurt computer science language said
A similar bill passed Kentucky Senate still need clear House
New Mexico also
And Tony Cárdenas introduced federal legislation December would designate programming language critical foreign language
This wildfire Stephenson said proposal
We understand trying go route
Make count math science credit
In Kentucky advocate pushed back proposed legislation part concern would reduce student option learning language
David Givens Republican state senator sponsored bill said would prefer computer science fulfill math science requirement state already stringent course requirement
It much challenge anything said
Even legislation broaden access computer science moving forward hurdle school implementation remain
First issue finding qualified teacher
Most state allow teacher certified computer science teacher said Stephenson
So either force teacher get secondary endorsement let anybody teach course
Related Blog States end dealing Ericson Georgia Tech call problem program wo train teacher state computer science certification state wo create certification program teacher training
Among teacher proficient computer science turnover problem said Ericson
They often leave classroom job industry
And student interest ca taken granted either
Surprisingly train teacher get excited go back teach ca get enough student said Derbenwick Miller

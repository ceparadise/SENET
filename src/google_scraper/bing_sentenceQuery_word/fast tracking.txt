Choosing one growing number offer around world could mean finishing degree much sooner always good thing
The idea behind degree program student save money fee accommodation like also getting head start entering employment
The catch
Well start convince employer degree value longer course
And assuming program pack much longer version could end much heavier workload may mean missing aspect student life
There always variation length time required
Depending country subject institution bachelor degree could take anywhere three six year
But many country seeing rising tuition fee high level student debt growing number university introducing degree program option allowing student graduate little two year
How possible may well ask
Well case skipping year
If want finish faster still get degree need prepared work intensively also study year
As result likely get shorter vacation
Many program based existing degree typically either course condensed three three year condensed two
This mean module likely covered shorter period squeezing year
So usually easy transfer onto course decide program
In four year standard period bachelor degree
But Hartwick College Oneonta New York say program offer degree equal value time cost exception nursing major extra coursework summer vacation
This advantage meaning student still use summer work internship travel time
However student take work semester order earn required amount credit shorter period
David Conway vice president enrolment management say We work closely student ensure able getting value benefit Since launching program enjoyed steady growth popularity college course achieve goal student enrolled course
This figure higher Hartwick president Margaret L Drugovich say program Conway agrees emphasizing one strong student earn bachelor degree three year Hartwick something recognized employer add
In fact surprising possible get good degree three year without missing opportunity difficulty finding employment
Three year standard country degree nation viewed le valuable North American equivalent
According survey commissioned British Council hiring manager US said believe UK degree better earned Among perceived benefit UK degree employer cite high quality education earlier specialization specific subject area need student complete independent study
So degree seem tick lot right box
But degree take even le three year
In Australia Bond University first start offering program
Rather two semester per year student Bond take three semester starting January May September
Vice Chancellor Tim Brailsford highlight benefit term financial saving also career acceleration
Potentially starting year earlier put student one additional year career ladder may also mean better placed promotion salary increase track benefiting earning capacity Professor Brailsford say
In US well may possible complete degree le three year
Advanced Placement AP course recognized many university allow student start earning degree credit still high school
This concept underlies University Central Missouri new Innovation Campus year allow student local high school start working towards degree also start covering cost training apprenticeship
The aim participant gain bachelor degree within two three year finishing high school also find easier enter employment already lot practical experience
University Central Missouri president Charles Ambrose belief kind innovation essential higher education remain accessible relevant
He argues greater collaboration educator community government industry develop sustainable approach higher education better prepare student work
Despite success reported Hartwick College US one country resistant accelerated degree program
A national survey found student college actually took longer graduate finished within four year
This may always intentional sometimes delay caused student transferring new college changing major difficulty getting place class want take due high demand
But also seems many student deliberately take time preferring stay college longer
Several college trialled degree past phased due low
Upper Iowa University example reported student actually wanted full experience
A similar picture found
In recent survey student Ontario majority student expressed preference four year rather three
And US graduating degree actually took longer
Extra cost aside appeal longer course obvious
Whether student day really best life people experience rich enjoyable one
In addition many undergraduate entirely sure want graduation even want focus graduation
The US system particularly designed accommodate allowing student explore one option committing specialization
In summary one suggesting accelerated fast track degree program best option even student
The general consensus among program provider ideal student know want get drive commitment get fast
This necessarily mean sacrificing aspect student life saying go work hard play hard may require focus end result rather student experience
On hand high tuition fee daunting prospect excited getting career started enjoy challenged degree program may ideal

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

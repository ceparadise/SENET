Technical Report Computer Science Engineering This paper seek bridge gap theory practice scheduling domain multimedia computer system
We show scheduling algorithm good theory often practical limitation
However algorithm modified based practical consideration existing theoretical result used
In paper motivate need new scheduling scheme multimedia protocol processing demonstrate performance prototype implementation
We explain observed result analysis measurement
More specifically show using strict preemption introduce overhead protocol processing context switching extra system call
We present scheduling scheme called delayed preemption RMDP show reduces overhead
We develop analyitical framework analyze RMDP scheduling scheme lie region strict immediate preemption preemption
Byproducts analysis include simpler schedulability test scheduling variant scheduling fewer preemption
Finally measure overhead due context switching Pentium machine impact performance
We show scheudling clock interrupt occur ever millisecond RMDP lessen overhead context switching leading increase utilization much

In describes system subject constraint example
program must guarantee response within specified time constraint often referred deadline
The correctness type system depends temporal aspect well functional aspect
response often understood order millisecond sometimes microsecond
A system specified operating real time usually response within timeframe although response time may given
A system described one control environment receiving data processing returning result sufficiently quickly affect environment time
The term also used mean simulation clock run speed real clock mean without significant delay
software may use one following network provide essential framework build software application
Systems used many application must control aircraft vehicle must produce maximum deceleration intermittently stop braking prevent skidding
processing completed within specified deadline relative event deadline must always met regardless
The term derives use early process simulated rate matched real process called avoid ambiguity
often capable simulating much faster pace situation could dangerous slow simulation also recognized accounted
Minicomputers particularly onwards built dedicated DOG scanner increased need response important interaction incoming data operating system RTOS well date era
scheduling allowed low priority task CPU time foreground task needed execute gave absolute priority within foreground highest priority
operating system would also used multiuser duty
For example could run foreground background RDOG would introduce additional element scheduling algorithm make appropriate people interacting via
Once used later used popular anybody could use home computer system
The possibility deactivate interrupt allowed loop defined timing low allowed implementation operating system giving user interface disk drive lower priority thread
Compared Intel CPUs generates large latency Windows operating system neither operating system allow program take CPU completely use without using native machine language thus surpassing interrupting Windows code
However several coding library exist offer real time capability high level language variety operating system example
The subsequent family member etc
also became popular manufacturer industrial control system
This application area one control offer genuine advantage term process performance safety
A system said total correctness operation depends upon logical correctness also upon time performed
system well deadline classified consequence missing deadline Thus goal ensure deadline met goal becomes meeting certain subset deadline order optimize criterion
The particular criterion optimized depend application typical example include maximizing number deadline met minimizing lateness task maximizing number high priority task meeting deadline
Hard system used imperative event reacted within strict deadline
Such strong guarantee required system reacting certain interval time would cause great loss manner especially damaging surroundings physically threatening human life although strict definition simply missing deadline constitutes failure system
For example control system hard system delayed signal may cause engine failure damage
Other example hard embedded system include medical system heart industrial process controller
Hard system typically found interacting low level physical hardware
Early video game system vector graphic hard requirement nature graphic timing hardware
In context system normally priority driven scheduler
Other scheduling algorithm include ignoring overhead sufficient system load le
New overlay scheduling system assist managing large system mixture hard non application
Soft system typically used solve issue concurrent access need keep number connected system changing situation
An example software maintains update flight plan commercial flight plan must kept reasonably current operate latency second
Live system also usually soft violation constraint result degraded quality system continue operate also recover future using workload prediction reconfiguration methodology
In DSP process analyzed input generated output sample processed generated continuously time take input output set sample processing delay
It mean processing delay must bounded even processing continues unlimited time
That mean processing time per sample including greater sampling period reciprocal
This criterion whether sample grouped together large segment processed block processed individually whether long short
Consider example process requires second process second sound
However take second made DSP process
A common life analog standing line waiting checkout grocery store
If line asymptotically grows longer longer without bound checkout process
If length line bounded customer processed output rapidly average inputted process
The grocer might go business must least lose business make checkout process thus fundamentally important process
A signal processing algorithm keep flow input data output falling farther farther behind input
But delay output relative input bounded regarding process operates unlimited time signal processing algorithm even throughput delay may long
signal processing necessary sufficient live signal processing required
Live audio digital signal processing requires operation sufficient limit throughput delay tolerable performer using noticeable audience also directly watching performer
Tolerable limit latency live processing subject investigation debate estimated millisecond
bidirectional le m round trip twice unidirectional delay considered acceptable avoid undesired conversation
computing sometimes misunderstood accurate classification
For example massive executing scientific simulation may offer impressive performance yet executing computation
Conversely hardware software braking system designed meet required deadline performance gain obligatory
Furthermore network server highly loaded network traffic response time may slower case still succeed time hit deadline
Hence network server would considered system temporal failure delay etc
typically small compartmentalized limited effect catastrophic failure
In system beyond limit would often considered catastrophic application context
Therefore important requirement system predictability performance
Some kind software many fall either category
For instance chess program designed play tournament clock need decide move certain deadline lose game therefore computation chess program allowed run indefinitely moving
In case however high performance desirable work tournament chess program allotted time better move faster unconstrained chess program run sooner able move
This example also illustrates essential difference computation computation tournament chess program make decision next move allotted time loses fails scenario meeting deadline assumed necessary
indicative amount processing performed given amount time ability get done processing yield useful output available time
The term NRT refers time introduced automated transmission occurrence event use processed data display control purpose
For example display depicts event situation existed current time minus processing time nearly time live event
The distinction term near real time real time somewhat nebulous must defined situation hand
The term implies significant delay
In many case processing described would accurately described near
Near also refers delayed transmission voice video
It allows playing video image approximately without wait entire large video file download
Incompatible database common flat file database scheduled basis common data near
The distinction near varies delay dependent type speed transmission
The delay near typically order several second several minute
Several method exist aid design system example old successful method represents structure system
Other example UML

In part
A method allows object perform action whether action modify return value
An example This different programming language
The identifier mean method publicly accessible anyone allowed use
In comparison method may sometimes latter mean specific part program allowed use method never human user
A privately accessible method allows object belongs edit
This used give data
The identifier mean value

A OOP associated
An object mostly made data behavior form interface object present outside world
Data represented object behavior method
For example object would method state whether opened closed would property
In method defined object instance given class
One important capability method provides method overriding
The name used multiple different kind class
This allows sending object invoke behavior delegate implementation behavior receiving object
A method Java programming set behavior class object
For example object send message another object appropriate formula invoked whether receiving object etc
Methods also provide interface class use access modify data object
This known encapsulation
Encapsulation overriding two primary distinguishing feature method procedure call
overloading two significant way method differs conventional procedure function call
Overriding refers subclass redefining implementation method superclass
For example may method defined shape class
The various subclass etc
would define appropriate formula calculate area
The idea look object black box change internals object made minimal impact object use
This known encapsulation meant make code easier maintain
Method overloading hand refers differentiating code used handle message based parameter method
If one view receiving object first parameter method overriding special case overloading selection based first argument
The following simple example illustrates difference Accessor method used read data value object
Mutator method used modify data object
Manager method used initialize destroy object class
constructor destructors
These method provide facilitates
For example class provides accessor method retrieve current rather directly accessing balance data field later code implement complex mechanism balance retrieval fetch without dependent code needing changed
The concept encapsulation modularity unique programming
Indeed many way approach simply logical extension previous paradigm
A method called beginning object lifetime create initialize object process called
Initialization may include acquisition resource
Constructors may parameter usually return value language
See following example Java A method called automatically end object lifetime process called
Destruction language allow destructor method argument return value
Destruction implemented perform cleanup chore task object destruction
In language destructors known
They similar purpose function destructors difference language utilize language manual memory management sequence called different
An one
It often used specify subclass must provide implementation method
Abstract method used specify computer language
The following code show abstract class need extended The following subclass extends main class Class method method called rather instance
They typically used part object
class defined instance class object created
allow class created deleted
In sense provide functionality constructor destructors described
But language allows developer dynamically alter object model run time create new class redefine class hierarchy modify property etc
Special method language may support none special method defined
A language compiler may automatically generate default special method programmer may allowed optionally define special method
Most special method directly called rather compiler generates code call appropriate time
Static method meant relevant instance class rather specific instance
They similar static variable sense
An example would static method sum value variable every instance class
For example class might static method compute average price product
In Java commonly used static method This static method owning object run instance
It receives information argument
A static method invoked even instance class exist yet
Static method called static resolved compile time based class called dynamically case instance method resolved polymorphically based runtime type object
operator define action performed compiler class object assigned class object type
Operator method define operation performed symbol associated method parameter
Example Some procedural language extended capability leverage large skill set legacy code language still provide benefit development
Perhaps example extension programming language
Due design requirement add paradigm existing procedural language message passing unique capability terminology
For example method known
also concept member function allow
mean class achieve polymorphic behavior

Usability Evaluation evaluation quality usability interface design
Two common method used evaluation process Heuristic Evaluation analytical method User Testing empirical method
Both method strength limitation depending objective context usability evaluation
Heuristic evaluation usability inspection technique first developed Jakob Nielsen colleague Sharp
According Jakob Nielsen Heuristic evaluation usability engineering method finding usability problem user interface design attended part iterative design process
It usually conducted small group evaluator presented interface design required evaluate whether element follows set established usability principle
The inspection interface performed individual evaluator
Independently evaluator work interface several time least twice
The first round get feel flow interaction whilst second inspect specific various dialogue element interface
All problem encountered recorded listed respective heuristic
evaluation completed evaluator allowed communicate finding aggregated
This procedure important order ensure independent unbiased evaluation evaluator Jakob Nielsen
The rational grouping back evaluator discover many problem possible one single evaluator would able find problem
Different evaluator discover different problem
The Heuristic Evaluation developed Jakob Nielsen Mack consists ten general principle rule thumb
They Visibility system status Match system real world User control freedom Consistency standard Error prevention Recognition rather recall Flexibility efficiency use Aesthetic minimalist design Help user recognize diagnose recover error Help documentation
However evaluator may add new heuristic element heuristic supplement general heuristic
Ease Organizing Evaluation It easy
Being independent evaluator inspect anytime long product inspected
The whole inspection process handled evaluator without intervention anybody final part evaluation session whereby come together discus everything discovered
Before final part evaluator repeat inspection several time least twice
Less Cost Compared user testing evaluation need proper laboratory heuristic evaluation involves lesser cost time
The number evaluator much le person compared user testing method requires many user participating effective
Heuristic inspection also conducted anywhere even office industry premise
Effective Detection Problems By virtue experience knowledge quite easy evaluator identify major minor problem interface
The evaluator discussion session help identification problem missed overlooked evaluator
Single Evaluator Problem detection Heuristic Evaluation done single individual evaluator
However hard one person discover usability problem interface
According Nielsen averaging project single evaluator found usability problem interface
Not Providing Systematic Problem Fixes evaluation provide systematic way generate fix usability problem way ass probable quality design
The Paradox Less Cost Employing single evaluator reduce cost
But risk coverage problem
Thus necessary engage evaluator mean higher cost
The Risk Professional Differences If evaluator part development team may aware technical limitation design certain design decision made
This may lead difference development team evaluator may impede communication problem correction usability problem identified usability evaluation
Capturing low priority problem As Heuristic evaluation loosely structured hood evaluator capture problem may important correct
It waste time cost evaluator addressing kind problem evaluator also product developer
User testing usability evaluation method employ evaluator observe record performance user test session
According Helen Sharp quoted Dumas Redish goal test whether product developed usable intended user population achieve task designed
Thus method finding problem area engaging person similar target user perform certain task
Administered user testing laboratory controlled environment within scheduled time user required perform either certain task navigating menu information searching reading different typeface specific task
During user testing session evaluator user action order infer action related usability issue design interface Nielsen
The evaluator record everything user
The participant attitude action behavior facial expression remark kind gesture recorded
The Strength Empirical Method Identifying product problem observing empirically user interaction interface give better understanding problem need user
It enhanced followed brainstorming session
The Productive Aspect Brainstorming The brainstorming aloud session evaluator user encourages user talk share experience
This obviously help discovery many problem correction improvement product
Users Need Come First Sometimes evaluator software development specialist biased view user want need
User test neutralize situation telling really needed expected user perspective
Giving priority problem raised user also cool professional difference evaluator system developer
Problem Determining The Right Number User Testers The problem decide many user ideal test
There different opinion pertaining right number user engaged lab
A research study conducted Virzi show problem uncovered based group group user
Such case user number implies cost
However practically easy decide number optimum number user participate usability testing result may differ tested different context environment time
Functionalities Sometimes test could cover functionality product constraint time environment
Inability Capture Minor Usability Problems Though method evaluation good discovering major HCI problem quite difficult observe minor usability problem typographic inconsistency
There possibility even gesture observed user interpreted differently individual evaluator
Judging strength weakness Heuristic Evaluation User Testing rather difficult conclude either method better
It versus approach
Ideally good method advantage complement

The presence big actively alternating photograph right page leaving big white space left side waste website space
With placement make upper part Homepage
Active item Yemen Branch thumbnail branch presented hypertext Sabah Kota Bharu Sri Damansara visibly located
Even Application flag visible website open
Surprisingly Application functioning
When clicked lead nothing inactive flag
Usabilty Problems To User Poorly arranged may put user
A user find difficulty searching required item page
Icons visible waste user time searching right page information guidance
For example user search branch somewhere page go next page look Twintech branch
There occurance poor feedback system basic information
For example application form icon clicked feed back
Instead displaying user requested online application form nothing shown
This cause potential college applicant abandoning screen
Online Application put case
The single level Menu somewhat take longer searching time user
This affect flexibility ease navigation control website content
It convenient user select item content making choice main menu
Twintech Yemen Branch icon poorly located
It would visible located top page Homepage instead bottom page
Likewise active hypertext icon branch Malaysia placed Homepage instead user look link branch Kota Bharu Sarawak Malaysia
They located menu
Information Convocation redundant
On Homepage information convocation located three place
It would le confusing information placed one banner
As user need scroll go page search branch
The heuristic conformed Aesthetic Minimalist Design This attention given Homepage layout give visual impact user
Basic content item visibly arranged attractive user
The scattered arrangement active online Twintech branch result Online Application flag somewhat discourage user continue browsing
Also arrangement big photograph top page create big white space inactive thumbnail picture randomly page spoil attractiveness website
Flexibility Efficiency Use In relation comment poor arrangement active icon limit efficiency accessing page website
Consistency Standards The many form text title subtitle paragraph caption font size depict inconsistency oversight basic standard
Even one page user discover low contrasting title line use fade text mistaken hypertext function
The Menu Search Function General Navigation Problems The Problems The Menu rightly located upper left Homepage consists five menu item Home Student Programmes Studies About Us Contact Us
However Menu designed feature could facilitate user selection quickly especially Studies Student About Us
Usability Problem To The User If user want access specific Programme
Biotechnology user go Programme page user select list
If multilevel menu user easily access page one click
Menu consisting five main item also affect speed access rest content
In relation menu contain adequate basic content
For example Us menu information college organizational structure though established University College year ago
Even user click Us Us menu relevant information
The Heuristic Not Conformed User Control Freedom The single level menu delay quick operation user
A user search look perhaps hidden required information
Flexibility Ease use Relating control problem existing feature menu design limit flexibility user
Instead selecting item direct menu user undergo several search process
Consistency Standards Menu design reach normal standard sophistication
Simply standard pay attention way interface system plea user
The Problems These two problem kind
Both box lead nothing
The Application placed every page website
However user click get application form display anything
In fact take quite minute downloading time give Time Out message
Several attempt made getting result
Likewise website button also demonstrates feedback
It function expected
The search ineffective
There feedback inputting requested information refreshed page
For example Student page word typed Search box displayed Homepage instead page
Also clicking active Convocation picture bring convocation information page Homepage
Usability Problems To The User The Application put user potential college applicant
Perhaps user may try time
But feedback session waste user time also lead distress
It took minute wait Online Application get expired message
The duration considered long interface efficiency standard
Regarding Search box sheer waste time user requested information provided
In fact Search result display Homepage
The feedback appeared picture icon clicked Homepage displayed
This kind feedback undoubtedly bring mental distress frustration user
It affect smoothness navigation flow
The Heuristics Not conformed Visibility system status For three active item feedback system unsatisfactory
The Online Application failed produce application page Search box also failed search right information bring Homepage user active Convocation also led user Homepage
So website course kept user informed something else user interested
Error prevention Error prevention alert flashed signaled user especially failing display online application form
Flexibility efficiency use As function functioning expected website give opportunity user browse explore easily freely learn content
Consistency Standards From result obtain poor feedback system clear website inspected user tested satisfactorily
The designing web missed basic interface standard helping user joyful experience
User control freedom The user able experience freedom moving around browsing process hampered active yet icon button
The Problems There quick page exiting
A user use standard button exit task
So user want exit page quickly user scroll Home button right bottom page using Space arrow
There also hypertext line located visibly working area user look Home button page using page approach
Even disappointing take quite time
It would better Home Previous page button placed active page visible place easy reach screen
Usability problem The User Since exit built interface design user either exit clicking home button far page using Arrow Window upper Left corner exit
As example Webmail clicked prompt window user enter Name
If user decide carry like exit page user use button window quick exit icon
However moment Cancel button clicked displayed another webmail window Log In
At page user exit quickly Home button anywhere
A user click Arrow browser go back Homepage
The exit system particular page
This quite inconvenience take step exit
The heuristic conformed User Control Freedom Under heuristic principle interface function emergency exit leave unwanted state without go extended dialogue
But case user step exiting clicking Arrow key
Consistency Standards To today standard system help user exit one key stroke instead going several step
Flexibility Efficiency use After inspection done obvious interface system designer overlooked efficiency use heuristic facilitate expert novice user
The Problems In general colour contrast text writing may distress user
The choice low shade grey used date line small paragraph strain eye user
In contrast use blue Us box occupying almost whole screen surprise user
Some smudgy letter address readable
Usability problem To The User The low colour contrast together small font tends strain eye user eye
As normally experienced fade text line usually indicate hypertext web
This may confuse user lead disappointment distress
As visally clear due small font fade grey line quite annoying user
A user spend time focusing text read
Even grey shade colour contrast well font size contrast title helping user see line paragraph clearly conveniently
Further Faculty page mix red black colour paragraph
In contrast Us page display bold sizable font quite irritating visual
With blue background black smudgy writing user familiar language find difficulty reading understanding message word
The heuristic conformed Consistency Standards Using low fade grey colour text conform principle contrast effectiveness conveying message
There inconsistency choice colour shade colour used convey certain content website
Aesthetic minimalist design The display text visual mixed colour font reduce aesthetic aspect website
It sore user stay long web
Based Heuristic Evaluation conducted problem discovered mainly pertains Visiblity system status User control freedom Consistency standard Flexibility efficiency use Aesthetic minimalist design
The heuristic inspection conducted could get feedback heuristic namely Match system real world Error prevention Recognition rather recall Help user recognize diagnose recover error Help documentation
Perhaps due nature web designed give college information rather interactive interface system
One aspect highlighted Application Box
As Application page accessed difficult inspect whether system Error Prevention system
So far alert found
Basic major problem rectified IUCTT Feedback system Homepage layout Menu quality Home button Quick Exit button whole text quality
The application flag put potential applicant
Likewise failure button fulfill user request result user frustration
The feedback display Homepage instead expected page address whenever user click More branch irritating
The appearance layout Homepage well limited menu function may affect interface efficiency effectiveness
The layout Homepage screen page visually attractive
There many white space homepage page
Regarding Menu menu
Thus Menu function could improved facilitate navigation website content
To today standard tt single level multilevel well increase menu item five seven item wherever relevant
The Us page look irritating due black bold font
For greater flexibility ease interface interaction system incorporate easy access Home Quick Exit button increase efficiency effectiveness navigation
The text whole website improved term colour contrast font size text title subtitle date hypertext letter case choice lower upper case like
Judging text webdsite inferred part given attention
The text part website need improved taking aesthetic aspect consideration
Other minor problem addressed inactive picture arrangement active thumbnail picture visibility layout website page
For improvement website heuristically user testing method interest user

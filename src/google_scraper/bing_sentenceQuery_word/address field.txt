The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In data several part known divided
arrange data set also called
Each record consists several field record form
Examples field name gender hair colour
In also called within
In case regular field also called instance object example class field one distinct name per employee
A static field also called one variable shared instance
Fields abstracted allow read written field translated getter setter method call
Fields contain fixed number bit known fixed length field
A four byte field example may contain bit binary integer plus sign bit bit
A byte name field may contain person name typically padded blank end
The disadvantage using fixed length field part field may wasted space still required maximum length case
Also field omitted padding missing field still required maintain fixed start position within record instance
A variable length field always physical size
Such field nearly always used text field large field vary greatly length
For example bibliographical database like many small field publication date author name also abstract vary greatly length
Reserving field length would inefficient would enforce maximum length abstract space would wasted record particularly many article lacked abstract entirely
Database implementation commonly store field special way order make record given type uniform small size
Doing help performance
On hand data form stored typical file system transmitted across network usually us quite different performance strategy
The choice depends factor total size record performance characteristic storage medium expected pattern access
Database implementation typically store variable length field way If field often empty additional optimization come play

It Friday evening
I lying bed phone hand reading class spread next
They conveniently slipped mind past half hour I pay heed I suddenly remember photo I posted Instagram yesterday
Guess work I church since I arrived Stanford week ago past Sunday minute
I accompanied incessant baby yelping cue every second group tourist taking Christmas card picture front main altar mother loudly whispering direction Desk Editor Back high school Khalil Griffin feel comfortable taking computer science class
In high school I stereotyped CS Griffin said
Everyone else class At Stanford Griffin gave CS another shot majored
Yet still recognized lack racial diversity among peer professor CS class
In first week last quarter Griffin spoke major advisor Stephen Cooper concern
Now Griffin five CS major getting ready attend ACM Richard Tapia Celebration Diversity Computing Conference next month Boston expense paid School Engineering
VICTOR Stanford Daily While Stanford representative attended national diversity conference year mark first time Stanford serf platinum supporter contributed event according Valerie Taylor executive director national Center Minorities People Disabilities Information Technology
The investment conference one example CS department latest collaboration student address support ethnic diversity among CS undergraduate population recent effort department turning attention according Cooper associate professor CS
We realized need becoming aggressive trying support student Cooper said
While student largely agreed ethnic diversity CS major Stanford fare much better peer institution recognized still work done create welcoming environment underrepresented minority department
When Pablo Hernandez took CS Programming Abstractions freshman year quickly made unsettling realization
I sitting room I realized I like one four Latinos class huge problem Hernandez said
Jordan Miller president Stanford Society Black Students Engineers SBSE said issue stereotype threat underrepresented minority feeling belonging CS others class look like still prevalent problem Stanford
Taylor leading speaker importance diversity computing said feeling isolation among minority student CS lead retention issue fewer student color choose stay computing field
This turn add pipeline issue enough racially diverse CS professor serve mentor future student
Keith Schwarz
lecturer CS recognizes various stereotype exist computer science turn several people away field
With computer science easy get people bounce right Schwarz said
You make stuff arbitrarily VICTOR Stanford Daily When Griffin approached advisor last quarter concern lack ethnic diversity CS Stanford learned took student initiative drawing faculty attention issue get thing rolling
Cooper noted similar strategy led collaborative effort last year addressing lack woman CS
Students brought gender gap issue attention faculty led creation woman CS student group
Tara Balakrishnan Women Computer Science said CS department serf support program woman CS offering fund help put event announcing group event introductory class
Schwarz said started getting involved effort support woman CS learning issue student realized past summer department done lot outreach diversity group
After contacting SBSE Stanford Society Latino Engineers SOLE group soon learned student coming together start initiative address ethnic diversity CS DiversityBase
The initiative beginning stage brings together CS major various ethnic engineering society campus form network peer mentor underclassman friendly community within CS field according Jorge Aguirre president SOLE one student leader DiversityBase
The CS department really excited want push need energy way lot closer student body Aguirre added
While Schwarz look forward initiative role addressing concern underrepresented minority CS student also recognize CS department still contribute cause way
We much organization Miller said SBSE effort create welcoming environment CS member
One concern Miller said certain black CS major face lecture unable resonate presented material want find way use skill learn class able give back community rather find way make money Silicon Valley
Opening possibility CS degree engineering degree really resonates community Miller said
To address concern Schwarz like present example introductory class lecture CS look like way defies stereotype
One example mobile app development big communication system would allow texting Kenya mobile technology much prevalent topic
We done bit piece
We Schwarz said CS department effort address issue ethnic diversity
With field computing ubiquitous society Taylor CS department invited speak campus spring said demographic field must align society demographic whole
Whether program CS department investment resource CS faculty student recognize benefit increasing ethnic diversity CS campus
Schwarz said one tactical benefit come increase ethnic diversity even gender diversity member underrepresented community better address problem prevalent specifically group
I think important people background access sort create solution enables solve important pressing problem normally get lot attention Schwarz said
Others like Griffin hope bring back diversity strategy upcoming conference apply Stanford said diverse voice would contribute fresh new perspective field computer science otherwise lost
While student faculty agreed still much done party fully address diversity concern department field CS overall work towards solution underway
Everyone really seem care question best Schwarz said
Tagged Stereotype threat trope
This could easily subtitle article
I urge fellow minority reject idea sensitive group must classmate professor look like u order pursue certain career path make money Silicon Valley altruistic subtext giving back community race ethnicity central precept must inform every decision make
You want study c go right ahead hand holding needed
Implicit Griffin story minority require hand holding financial otherwise become CS major
This encouraging message integrate computer science department rather largely heighten identity politics associated race majro
Liberal extremist like author racist
They spend making u minoroties think fail end underrepresented
I agree
This political strategy label minority capable repeating full time hate successful ethnicity horribly hypocritical

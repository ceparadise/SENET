That job market home tough IT personnel easy fill support role nothing really solid people age level experience
They prefer degree least relevant work experience
I flexible relocation required
I would love leave technical track get management
I leader almost project school college

My long term career goal brings
I see progressing anywhere I continue support role I floating around
Since I able fit job scope I able anything actually
This get tiring I really wan na become architect something similar least
Thus looking appropriate job next step
I currently position system administrator small government organization
However I almost anything bos asks includes modelling business process writing performing User Acceptance Test setting Touch Interface Devices program whatever else asks
I would like something requires exercise critical thinking
It something I realized I helping enterprise architect model business process I involved tiny bit
I really enjoyed modelling business process using thinking way streamline make better
I think I translate business requirement technical technical business
This I believe I might actually good
Salary surely important right I feel setting right career track important salary

Regards Ray Dear Ray Let commence reply echoing back understanding goal review detail questionnaire reply en route making hopefully helpful observation recommendation help achieve
If reply provoke additional question feel free respond directly work
To begin I think goal eminently sound completely worth pursuing
But stretch get IT support substantial IT role particularly given kind circumstance describe home country
I would suggest try focus everything future work personal development effort work way system deployment ultimately system design architecture
I suggest taking survey IT architect program certification available start thinking might begin pursue one another sometime next year
The delay decision pursuit necessary two reason If make progress front find substantial IT position next year I believe excellent chance meeting goal find working IT architect thereabouts
With general advice mind however I see top degree point present following overall objective This programme aim meet need learner intend enter job market Systems Analysts IT Specialists Database Administrators Network Engineers IT Unfortunately I think best choice UofP overall offering move skill strongly toward professed area interest IT architect would suggest look instead Or perhaps even better might want contact program recruiter TOP UP offering describe current diploma ask I would ultimately like work IT architect decade
Given diploma Business IT technical university TOP UP degree plan would recommend help pursue goal They may better idea advice offer might also program would help converge objective quickly directly
And fact might also want consider ask institution interest might kind Master Degree program Computer Science Informatics Information Technology might take IT Architecture focus instead
Surely would direct way start working toward goal
Given interest management window operation working support always provides intelligent observer also consider adding Master Business Administration educational objective focus emphasis business process along IT governance compliance regime forth considerable attention ITIL certification part parcel career thread
It also much case given interest objective pursuit Project Management Institute Project Management Professional PMP certification could work considerable career advantage
That heartening see already thinking direction I read questionnaire reply
My response Keep thinking along line work direction every possible opportunity
In near term next month I believe pursuit ITIL Foundation look lie beyond aggressive pursuit PMP top priority
At time formulate next step higher education decide whether TOP UP necessary pursue Master instead emphasis IT architecture degree plan available
Next jump degree choosing
Once finish thing want hit job market see get closer home base need maintain contract work general geographic vicinity case current job
Hopefully able market effectively IT generalist project manager system designer next avatar
If could worse continue system administration area particularly bos keep letting tackle project hone skill groom responsible capable position future
Be sure keep good record project accomplishment work activity
Try get bos senior IT professional write testimonial effort along way excellent way join LinkedIn keep professional activity profile time get strong recommendation boss colleague professor forth work way toward goal
Over next year two option become much clearer
You also able formulate afterward constantly refine plan personal professional development toward IT architect role wish fill
Again I confident reach goal particularly already seem understand considerable span time substantial effort real expense involved make thing work
I like close wonderful epigram I saw LinkedIn yesterday seems incredibly apt situation If willing learn No one help
If determined learn No one stop
Ultimately determination effort learning experience acquire see achieve goal
I believe already excellent start

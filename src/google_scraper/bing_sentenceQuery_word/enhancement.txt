In principle processing given input problem altering specific way increase
The altered input usually stored accessed simplify problem
By exploiting structure property input input enhancement creates various efficiency
Input enhancement searching essential component algorithm world time computer science
The main idea behind principle efficiency search much faster time taken create sort given input attempting search element said data structure
Presorting technique sorting input attempting search
Because addition sorting component algorithm added runtime searching algorithm multiplied competes slowest portion algorithm
Since efficiency algorithm measured slowest component addition sorting component negligible search le efficient
Unfortunately presorting usually slowest component algorithm
Contrasting searching algorithm without presort almost always slower presort
The sorting portion algorithm process input problem searching portion algorithm even reached
Having element input sorted sort order make search trivial practice
The simplest sorting algorithm worst case runtime O advanced sorting algorithm worst case runtime O log worst case O almost always O log
Utilizing sorting algorithm search algorithm incorporates presorting yield efficiency
A simple example benefit presorting seen algorithm check array unique element If array element given return true every element array unique otherwise return false
The presented Without presort worst case algorithm would require every element checked every element two possible outcome either duplicate element array last two element array duplicate
This result O efficiency
Now compare similar algorithm utilizes presorting
This algorithm sort inputted array check pair element duplicate
The pseudocode presented As previously stated least efficient part algorithm sorting array efficient sort selected would run O log
But array sorted array need traversed would run O
This result O log efficiency
This simple example demonstrates capable input enhancement technique presorting
The algorithm went runtime runtime result large input
Creating data structure efficiently search data also form input enhancement
Placing data tree store search input another popular technique
used throughout computer science many different type tree name small developed properly store access manipulate data maintaining structure
Trees principal data structure dictionary implementation
The benefit putting data tree great especially data manipulated repeatedly searched
Binary search tree simplest yet common type tree implementation
The insertion deletion searching item tree worst case O often executed O log
This make repeated searching element even quicker large input
There many different type binary search tree work efficiently even upon addition removal item like AVL tree worst case O log searching inserting deletion
Taking time put inputted data structure great repeated searching element opposed searching data enhanced
complex issue world forefront internet online world
When given keyword string need searched among million upon million word would take unbelievable amount time match string character per character
Input enhancement allows input altered make process much faster
The algorithm problem would perform follows When presented string character often called key pattern string would compared every single character longer string often called text
If matched character occurs check second character key see match
If next character checked string match subsequent character match entire key shift single character
This continues key found text exhausted
This algorithm extremely inefficient
The maximum number check trial would trial making efficiency worst case O
On average case maximum number check trial would never reached would executed resulting average time efficiency O
Because necessity efficient string matching algorithm several faster algorithm developed utilizing idea input enhancement
The key preprocessed gather information look text information stored order refer back necessary
The accessing information constant time greatly increase runtime efficiency algorithm use famously algorithm algorithm
These algorithm part use method obtain efficiency main difference key composed
As demonstration input enhancement string matching one examine simplified version algorithm algorithm
The algorithm start th character text compare character
Let call character
There possible case happen next
The first possible case character key
If occurs entire key shifted length key
The second possible case character current character key
If occurs key shifted align rightmost occurrence character
The third possible case character match last character key character fully match key occur key
If occurs entire key shifted length key
The fourth last possible case character match key character fully match key occur key
If occurs key shifted align rightmost occurrence character
This may seem like efficient algorithm since check character every check
However case
Horspool algorithm utilizes shift table store number character algorithm shift run specific character
The input precomputed table every possible character encountered text
The shift size computed two option one character key shift size length key two character appears key shift value distance rightmost occurrence character first character key
The algorithm shift table generator given key alphabet possible character could appear string K input return shift table T
Pseudocode shift table generator example shift table string POTATO displayed After shift table constructed input enhancement stage algorithm line key start executing
The algorithm executes matching text found key overlap last character text
If algorithm encounter pair character match access table character shift value shift accordingly
Horspool algorithm take key K text M output either index matching substring string Key found depending result
Pseudocode Horspool algorithm presented Although may evident worst case runtime efficiency algorithm O
Fortunately text random runtime efficiency linear O
This place Horspool algorithm utilizes input enhancement much faster class algorithm problem
Input enhancement often used interchangeably
Although related several important difference must noted

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I working program involves detecting face photo reading paper someone wrote said success detecting face applied enhancement image one contrast enhancement
The exact word
Contrast enhancement improves overall quality image
Gaussian convolution using Gaussian function G x first applied input value channel image HSV space
The convolution process expressed follows They give Equation con x G x NOTE original value CON Eq
denotes convolution result contains luminance information surrounding pixel
The center pixel value compared Gaussian convolution result order find amount contrast enhancement center pixel
This process described following equation Equation ce x le x E x NOTE le result another enhancement done previously
CE x result contrast enhancement E x given following relation E x con x x Here g image dependent parameter determined using standard deviation input value channel image
If center pixel brighter surrounding pixel contrast pixel pulled
On hand center pixel darker neighboring pixel contrast pixel lowered
The problem understanding math NCEA Level Last year collage understand first part help would much appreciated The full paper Convolution relatively simple operation perform make fast involves little extra work
In general convolve discretized function F different discretized function G simply performing following operation G x Where N number discrete value Notice effectively summing product F G centered around x
In image look like G x j The paper reading tell F V channel image HSV space G gaussian function

In mathematically based technique whose purpose help implementation system software
They used describe system analyze behavior aid design verifying key property interest rigorous effective reasoning tool
These specification sense syntax semantics fall within one domain able used infer useful information
In passing decade computer system become increasingly powerful result become impactful society
Because better technique needed assist design implementation reliable software
Established engineering discipline use mathematical analysis foundation creating validating product design
Formal specification one way achieve software engineering reliability predicted
Other method commonly used enhance code quality
Given possible use technique demonstrate system design correct respect specification
This allows incorrect system design revised major investment made actual implementation
Another approach use probably correct step transform specification design ultimately transformed implementation
It important note formal specification implementation rather may used develop
Formal specification describe system system
A good specification must following attribute adequate internally consistent unambiguous complete satisfied minimal A good specification One main reason interest formal specification provide ability perform proof software implementation
These proof may used validate specification verify correctness design prove program satisfies specification
A design implementation ever declared correct
It ever correct respect given specification
Whether formal specification correctly describes problem solved separate issue
It also difficult issue address since ultimately concern problem constructing abstracted formal representation informal concrete abstraction step amenable formal proof
However possible specification proving challenge concerning property specification expected exhibit
If correct theorem reinforce specifier understanding specification relationship underlying problem domain
If specification probably need changed better reflect domain understanding involved producing implementing specification
Formal method software development widely used industry
Most company consider apply software development process
This may variety reason Other limitation Formal specification technique existed various domain various scale quite time
Implementations formal specification differ depending kind system attempting model applied point software life cycle introduced
These type model categorized following specification paradigm In addition paradigm way apply certain heuristic help improve creation specification
The paper referenced best discus heuristic use designing specification

Ontology Ling Liu Tamer Eds
ontology semantic data model ontological engineering In context computer information science defines set representational primitive model domain knowledge discourse
The representational primitive typically class set attribute property relationship relation among class member
The definition representational primitive include information meaning constraint logically consistent application
In context database system ontology viewed level abstraction data model analogous hierarchical relational model intended modeling knowledge individual attribute relationship individual
Ontologies typically specified language allow abstraction away data structure implementation strategy practice language ontology closer expressive power logic language used model database
For reason ontology said semantic level whereas database schema model data logical physical level
Due independence lower level data model ontology used integrating heterogeneous database enabling interoperability among disparate system specifying interface independent service
In technology stack Semantic Web standard ontology called explicit layer
There standard language variety commercial open source tool creating working ontology
The term ontology come field philosophy concerned study existence
In philosophy one talk theory nature existence Aristotle ontology offer primitive category substance quality presumed account All That Is
In computer information science ontology technical term denoting artifact purpose enable modeling knowledge domain real imagined
The term adopted early Artificial Intelligence AI researcher recognized applicability work mathematical logic argued AI researcher could create new ontology computational model enable certain kind automated reasoning
In AI community came use term ontology refer theory modeled world Physics component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early effort create interoperability standard identified technology stack called ontology layer standard component knowledge system
A widely cited web page paper associated effort credited deliberate definition ontology technical term computer science
The paper defines ontology explicit specification conceptualization turn object concept entity presumed exist area interest relationship hold among
While term specification conceptualization caused much debate essential point definition ontology One objection definition overly broad allowing range specification simple glossary logical theory couched predicate calculus
But hold true data model complexity example relational database single table column still instance relational data model
Taking pragmatic view one say ontology tool product engineering thereby defined use
From perspective matter use ontology provide representational machinery instantiate domain model knowledge base make query service represent result calling service
For example API search service might offer textual glossary term formulate query would act
On hand Semantic Web standard suggests specific formalism encoding ontology OWL several variant vary expressive power
This reflects intent specification abstract data model domain conceptualization independent particular form
Ontology discussed applied context software database engineering yet theoretical grounding well
specifies vocabulary make assertion may input output knowledge agent software program
As ontology provides language communicating agent
An agent supporting interface required use term ontology knowledge
Nonetheless definition formal constraint ontology put restriction stated language
In essence committing ontology
supporting interface using ontology vocabulary requires statement asserted input output definition constraint ontology
This analogous requirement row database table insert statement SQL must consistent integrity constraint stated declaratively independently internal data format
Similarly ontology must formulated representation language intended semantic level specification independent data modeling strategy implementation
For instance conventional database model may represent identity individual using primary key assigns unique identifier individual
However primary key identifier artifact modeling process denote something domain
Ontologies typically formulated language closer expressive power logical formalism predicate calculus
This allows ontology designer able state semantic constraint without forcing particular encoding strategy
For example typical ontology formalism one would able say individual member class attribute value without referring implementation pattern use primary key identifier
Similarly ontology one might represent constraint hold across relation simple declaration A subclass B might encoded join foreign key relational model
concerned making representational choice capture relevant distinction domain highest level abstraction still clear possible meaning term
As form data modeling knowledge skill required
The heritage computational ontology philosophical ontology rich body theory make ontological distinction systematic coherent manner
For example many insight formal ontology motivated understanding real world applied building computational ontology world data
When ontology encoded standard formalism also possible reuse large previously designed ontology motivated systematic account human knowledge language
In context ontology embody result academic research offer operational method put theory practice database system
Ontologies part standard stack Semantic Web used specify standard conceptual vocabulary exchange data among system provide service answering query publish reusable knowledge base offer service facilitate interoperability across multiple heterogeneous system database
The key role ontology respect database system specify data modeling representation level abstraction specific database design logical physical data exported translated queried unified across independently developed system service
Successful application date include database interoperability cross database search integration web service

Tel Fax EMail This paper argues expanding scope science make difficult sustain traditional scientific engineering model research
In particular recent work formal method abandoned traditional empirical method
Similarly research requirement engineering human computer interaction challenged proponent formal method
These tension stem fact Science misnoma
Topics currently considered part discipline computing science technology rather theory driven
This creates problem academic department impose scientific criterion assessment PhDs
It therefore important people ask Research Computing Science starting higher degree
This paper intended high level introduction first year research student student advanced MSc course
It read conjunction research skill computing science
Good research practice suggests begin defining term
The Oxford Concise dictionary defines research However many reason approach unsatisfactory model research
The main objection carry high risk
For example artefact may fail long learn anything conclusion seeking support
Indeed often case approach ignores formation clear hypothesis conclusion artefact built
This may lead artefact become important researcher idea intended establish
The lack clear hypothesis need barrier might seem
The proof demonstration approach much common current engineering practice
Iterative refinement used move implementation gradually towards desired solution
The evidence elicited previous failed attempt used better define goal research work progress
The key problem iterative development artefact turn requires method structure
Engineers need carefully plan way fault found one iteration fed back subsequent development
This typically done testing technique based upon model scientific argument
This close relationship engineering scientific method surprising There many problem standard approach scientific empiricism applied computing science
The principle objection many aspect computing defy use probabilistic measure analysing result empirical test
For example many statistical measure rely upon independence test hypothesis
Such technique clearly used attempting measure performance system attempt optimise performance time rule load balancing algorithm etc
Secondly difficult impose standard experimental condition upon product computer science
For example program behaves one way one set operating condition guarantee behave way another set condition
These condition might go level alpha particle hitting memory chip
Thirdly difficult generalise result tightly controlled empirical experiment
For example user find system easy use evaluation guarantee another user able use product amidst distraction everyday working environment
Finally difficult determine sufficient number trial conducted support many hypothesis
For example attempt prove program always satisfies property almost certainly doomed failure using standard experimental technique The number potential execution path even simple code make impossible test property every possible execution path
The field mathematical reasoning research area right
It however possible identify two different approach use formal proof research technique computing science The first incredible care need made interpretation result mathematical proof
Formal method nothing system argumentation mistake expected
Problems arise mistake difficult detect given complex nature mathematics often used
Recall central feature empirical approach open peer review used check method correct
The second problem formal reasoning scope limited
Interactive time critical system pose specially challenge application mathematics
These issue addressed many problem remain
The third problem relates cost applying formal technique
It take long time acquire necessary skill
Similarly take several month conduct relatively simple proof medium large scale application
Finally argued inadequate discussion failure formal method
Again important recall failure prove hypothesis valuable result empirical technique
Exaggerated claim made formal reasoning typically researcher many claim falsified
As result error application mathematical reasoning seen source shame rather learning opportunity one colleague peer

In technique arranging complexity computer system
It work establishing level complexity person interacts system suppressing complex detail current level
The programmer work idealized interface usually well defined add additional level functionality would otherwise complex handle
For example programmer writing code involves numerical operation may interested way number represented underlying hardware
whether detail suppressed said leaving simply programmer work
In addition task sending email message across continent would extremely complex programmer start piece fiber optic cable basic hardware component
By using layer complexity created abstract away physical cable network layout presenting programmer virtual data channel task manageable
Abstraction apply control data abstraction action
The notion programming viewed way combine abstraction data code
The abstract definition used common family object different implementation behavior share meaning
The mechanism programming used define common interface
The recommendation programmer use abstraction whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually known
The requirement programming language provide suitable abstraction also called abstraction principle
Computing mostly operates independently concrete world The hardware implement interchangeable others
The software structured enable human create enormous system concentrating issue time
These architecture made specific choice abstraction
architecture inevitable complex
A central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial language developed express specific aspect system
help planning
processed computer
An example abstraction process generational development
Each stage used stepping stone next stage
The language abstraction continues example
Within programming language feature let programmer create new abstraction
These include
Some abstraction remain invisible operate design system
Some abstraction try limit range concept programmer need aware completely hiding abstraction turn built
The software engineer writer criticised effort claiming abstraction never completely hide detail however negate usefulness abstraction
Some abstraction designed interoperate abstraction example programming language may contain making call language
Different programming language provide different type abstraction depending intended application language
For example Analysts developed various method formally specify software system
Some known method include Specification language generally rely abstraction one kind another since specification typically defined earlier project abstract level eventual implementation
The specification language example allows definition class waterfall project remain abstract architecture specification phase project
Programming language offer control abstraction one main purpose use
Computer machine understand operation low level moving bit one location memory another location producing sum two sequence bit
Programming language allow done higher level
For example consider statement written fashion To human seems fairly simple obvious calculation
However step necessary carry evaluation return value assign value variable actually quite subtle complex
The value need converted binary representation often much complicated task one would think calculation decomposed compiler interpreter assembly instruction much le intuitive programmer operation shifting binary register left adding binary complement content one register another simply human think abstract arithmetical operation addition multiplication
Finally assigning resulting value variable labeled used later involves additional step looking variable label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation memory location etc
Without control abstraction programmer would need specify step time simply wanted add multiply couple number assign result variable
Such duplication effort two serious negative consequence Structured programming involves splitting complex program task smaller piece clear interface component reduction complexity potential
In simple program may aim ensure loop single obvious exit point possible single exit point function procedure
In larger system may involve breaking complex task many different module
Consider system handle payroll ship shore office These layer produce effect isolating implementation detail one component assorted internal method others
programming embrace extends concept
Data abstraction enforces clear separation property detail implementation
The abstract property visible client code make use data data concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed change example incorporate efficiency improvement time
The idea change supposed impact client code since involve difference abstract behaviour
For example one could define called uniquely associate value may retrieved specifying corresponding key
Such lookup table may implemented various way even simple linear key value pair
As far client code concerned abstract property type case
Of course relies getting detail interface right first place since change major impact client code
As one way look interface form agreed behaviour data type client code anything spelled contract subject change without notice
In theory involves facility define object represent abstract actor perform work report change state communicate object system
The term refers hiding detail extending concept earlier programming language associate strongly data standardizing way different data type interact beginning
When abstraction proceeds operation defined enabling object different type substituted called
When proceeds opposite direction inside type class structuring simplify complex set relationship called
Various programming language offer similar facility abstraction support general strategy programming includes substitution one another similar role
Although generally supported image package may predetermine great many
This would leave minimum binding change
example feature le distinction use delegation
Individual object function abstracted flexibly better fit shared functional heritage
exemplifies another extreme relies heavily static binding turn certain flexibility problem
Although example offer alternate strategy achieving abstraction fundamentally alter need support abstract noun code programming relies ability abstract verb function noun data structure either process
Consider example sample fragment represent common farm animal level abstraction suitable model simple aspect hunger feeding
It defines class represent state animal function With definition one could create object type call method like In example class abstraction used place actual animal abstraction case generalisation
If one requires differentiated hierarchy animal differentiate say provide milk provide nothing except meat end life intermediary level abstraction probably DairyAnimal cow goat would eat food suitable giving good milk MeatAnimal pig steer would eat food give best
Such abstraction could remove need application coder specify type food could concentrate instead feeding schedule
The two class could related using stand alone programmer could define varying degree two type
These facility tend vary drastically language general achieve anything possible others
A great many operation overload data type data type effect degree inheritance mean achieve polymorphism
The class notation simply coder convenience
Decisions regarding abstract keep control coder become major concern design determining relevant relationship real world concern
In general determine appropriate abstraction one must make many small decision scope domain analysis determine system one must cooperate legacy analysis perform detailed analysis expressed within project time budget constraint design
In simple example domain barnyard live pig cow eating habit legacy constraint detailed analysis coder must flexibility feed animal available thus reason code type food class design single simple Animal class pig cow instance function
A decision differentiate DairyAnimal would change detailed analysis domain legacy analysis would entirely control programmer refer abstraction programming distinct abstraction domain legacy analysis
When discussing refers act considering le detailed safe definition observed program behavior
For instance one may observe final result program execution instead considering intermediate step execution
Abstraction defined precise model execution
Abstraction may respect property one answer question property equally well concrete abstract model
For instance wish know result evaluation mathematical expression involving integer worth need perform operation modulo familiar form abstraction
Abstractions however though necessarily
That possible get sound answer though abstraction may simply yield result
For instance may abstract student class minimal maximal age one asks whether certain person belongs class one may simply compare person age minimal maximal age age lie outside range one may safely answer person belong class one may answer I know
The level abstraction included programming language influence overall
The framework includes concept formalism
This framework allows designer programming language study abstraction characteristic design change abstraction influence language usability
Abstractions prove useful dealing computer program property computer program essentially see
As consequence automatic method deriving information behavior computer program either drop termination occasion may fail crash never yield result soundness may provide false information precision may answer I know question
Abstraction core concept
generally take place abstract version studied system
Computer science commonly present le commonly abstraction wherein level represents different model information process varying amount detail
Each level us system expression involving unique set object composition apply particular domain
Each relatively abstract higher level build relatively concrete lower level tends provide increasingly granular representation
For example gate build electronic circuit binary gate machine language binary programming language machine language application operating system programming language
Each level embodied determined level beneath making language description somewhat
Since many user database system lack familiarity computer database developer often hide complexity following level The lowest level abstraction describes system actually store data
The physical level describes complex data structure detail
The next higher level abstraction describes data database store relationship exist among data
The logical level thus describes entire database term small number relatively simple structure
Although implementation simple structure logical level may involve complex physical level structure user logical level need aware complexity
This referred
must decide information keep database use logical level abstraction
The highest level abstraction describes part entire database
Even though logical level us simpler structure complexity remains variety information stored large database
Many user database system need information instead need access part database
The view level abstraction exists simplify interaction system
The system may provide many database
The ability provide different level abstraction use
Some specifically generate design contain various level abstraction
Layered architecture partition concern application stacked group layer
It technique used designing computer software hardware communication system network component isolated layer change made one layer without affecting others

Essays argument computing education I seen lot discussion recently Computer Science versus Computer Programming school university level
A lot seems flawed lack common understanding either side involves
Allow muddy water diagram
I tried make list topic keep cropping area
Would like try draw line around one believe belong Computer Science one belong Programming
Do overlap
And impression different people talking
I hear line Computer Science More Than Just Programming lot organisation
My impression think programming solid blue line writing code
They worry Computer Science taught rote student churning simple code without deeper reasoning proper problem solving tickbox response growth Computer Science school
So want instead recognised Computer Science like red dashed line encompassing various topic writing code Meanwhile people arguing Computer Science useful student
I believe people think Computer Science solid green line
They instead envision degree like dashed purple line focusing practical aspect software developer Computer Science degree fairly broad church least UK
You could probably draw line around combination item find university UK offered content Computer Science branding
I guess take two way
You could argue Computer Science degree need tightening offer content
I think I favour opinion naming thing broadly call
But naming complicated issue relates worm university
A quick final note computational thinking may surprised see separated
Computational Thinking term bandied around lot recently thankfully Computational Thinking thought process involved formulating problem solution solution represented form effectively carried To mind Computational Thinking thus encompass
It capturing preciseness expression required write program interact precise system
I think need somehow clearer mean talk computer science programming taken u
If clarify spend time talking circle realising actually agree disagree
Feel free share thought comment
One additional post I read recently forgot weave main article Miles Berry What frustrates discussion I agree gist missing vital
There real discussion engineering part software engineering
The dotted purple stuff listed may many people practice often genuine engineering real software engineer
Perhaps matter lot application I work area thing like safety reliability vital
I concerned kind software life depend
For software like computer science important fundamental much engineering foundation another fundamental seldom ever taught computer science program

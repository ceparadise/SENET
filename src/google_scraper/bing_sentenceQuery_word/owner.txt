A recording discretely
Just word written paper information written computer file
There different designed different purpose
A file may designed store picture written message wide variety kind data
Some type file store several type information
By using computer program person open read change close computer file
Computer file may reopened modified copied arbitrary number time
Typically computer file organised keep track file enables people access
The word file derives Latin thread
File used publicly context computer storage early February In RCA advertisement describing new memory vacuum tube developed RCA stated result countless computation kept file taken
Such exists tube developed RCA Laboratories
Electronically retains figure fed calculating machine hold storage memorizes new one speed intelligent solution maze mathematics
In file denoted information stored
In early use underlying hardware rather content stored denominated file
For example disk drive denominated disk file
The introduction circa MIT concept managed several virtual file one storage device origin contemporary denotation word
Although contemporary demonstrates early concept file use greatly decreased
On modern file organized array
The file defined content since file solely container data although platform format usually indicated specifying rule byte must organized interpreted meaningfully
For example byte plain text file Windows associated either character byte image video audio file interpreted otherwise
Most file type also allocate byte allows file carry basic information
Some file system store arbitrary interpreted file system data outside file format linked file example
On file system done via database
All method however susceptible loss metadata format
At instant time file might size normally expressed number indicates much storage associated file
In modern operating system size whole number byte system limit
Many older operating system kept track number occupied file physical storage device
In system software employed method track exact byte count used special control character signal end text file
The general definition file require size real meaning however unless data within file happens correspond data within pool persistent storage
A special case file newly created file yet data written may serve kind file system accident result aborted disk operation
For example file link point typical system probably defined size seldom change
Compare also file size may obscure
This misleading really file system resource including device accessed like file still real distinction file core behave obscurity size one manifestation
As character device size
Information computer file consist smaller packet information often called line individually different share common trait
For example payroll file might contain information concerning employee company payroll detail record payroll file concern one employee record common trait related similar placing payroll information specific filing cabinet office computer
A text file may contain line text corresponding printed line piece paper
Alternatively file may contain arbitrary binary image may contain
The way information grouped file entirely designed
This led plethora le standardized file structure imaginable purpose simplest complex
Most computer file used create modify delete file use basis
The programmer create program decide file needed used often name
In case computer program manipulate file made visible computer user
For example user manipulates document file user personally name
Although content document file arranged format program understands user able choose name location file provide bulk information word text stored file
Many application pack data file single file called using internal marker discern different type information contained within
The benefit archive file lower number file easier transfer reduce storage usage organize outdated file
The archive file must often unpacked next using
The basic operation program perform file Files computer created moved modified grown shrunk deleted
In case computer program executed computer handle operation user computer also manipulate file necessary
For instance file normally created modified Microsoft Word program response user command user also move file directly using Windows computer CLI
In system program operate directly low level file
Only kernel deal file handle interaction file manner transparent program
The provides level mean interaction file simply filename instead
For example delete file file
There many link file removed considers file memory space free reallocated
This commonly considered security risk due existence
Any program us system function wipe file data
In modern computer system file typically accessed using name
In operating system name associated file
In others file anonymous pointed link name
In latter case user identify name link file false analogue especially exists one link file
Files link file located directory
However generally contain either list file list link file
Within definition paramount importance term file includes directory
This permit existence directory hierarchy directory containing
A name refers file within directory must typically unique
In word must identical name within directory
However operating system name may include specification type mean directory contain identical name one type object directory file
In environment file named file name path file directory must uniquely identify among file computer two file name path
Where file anonymous named reference exist within namespace
In case name within namespace refer exactly zero one file
However file may represented within namespace zero one name
Any string character may may name file link depending upon context application
Whether name depends type computer system used
Early computer permitted letter digit name file modern computer allow long name character containing almost combination letter unicode digit making easier understand purpose file glance
Some computer system allow file name contain space others
file name determined
Unix file system usually case sensitive allow application create file whose name differ case character
support multiple file system different policy regarding
The common file system multiple file whose name differ case user us edit file name
User application however usually allow user create multiple file name differing case
Most computer organize file hierarchy using folder directory catalog
The concept irrespective terminology used
Each folder contain arbitrary number file also contain folder
These folder referred subfolders
Subfolders contain still file folder thus building structure one master folder root folder name varies one operating system another contain number level folder file
Folders named file except root folder often name
The use folder make easier organize file logical way
When computer allows use folder file folder name also path identifies folder folder file folder resides
In path sort special used separate file folder name
For example illustration shown article path uniquely identifies file called folder called turn contained folder called
The folder file name separated slash example topmost root folder name path begin slash root folder name would precede first slash
Many computer system use file name help identify contain also known file type
On Windows computer extension consist dot period end file name followed letter identify type file
An extension identifies text file extension identifies type document documentation commonly
Even extension used computer system degree computer system recognizes heed vary system required system completely ignored presented
Many modern computer system provide method protecting file accidental deliberate damage
Computers allow multiple user implement control may may modify delete create file folder
For example given user may granted permission read file folder modify delete user may given permission read modify file folder execute
Permissions may also used allow certain user see content file folder
Permissions protect unauthorized tampering destruction information file keep private information confidential unauthorized user
Another protection mechanism implemented many computer When flag turned file accomplished computer program human user file examined modified
This flag useful critical information must modified erased special file used internal part computer system
Some system also include make certain file invisible flag used computer system hide essential system file user alter
Any file useful purpose must physical manifestation
That file abstract concept real computer system must real physical analogue exist
In physical term computer file stored type data storage device
For example store file
Hard disk ubiquitous form storage since early
Where file contain temporary information may stored
Computer file also stored medium case etc
The use also beginning rival hard disk drive
In operating system many file associated physical storage device
Examples file directory
These virtual file exist object within operating system kernel
As seen running user program file usually represented either
A File control block FCB area memory manipulated establish filename
passed operating system parameter used older IBM operating system early PC operating system including early version
A file handle generally either integer introduced around running ubiquitous
When computer file contain information extremely important process used protect disaster might destroy file
Backing file simply mean making copy file separate location restored something happens computer deleted accidentally
There many way back file
Most computer system provide utility program assist process become many file safeguard
Files often copied removable medium writable CDs cartridge tape
Copying file another hard disk computer protects failure one disk necessary protect failure destruction entire computer copy file must made medium taken away computer stored safe distant location
The method automatically make three grandfather file oldest copy file son current copy
The way computer organizes name store manipulates file globally referred Most computer least one file system
Some computer allow use several different file system
For instance newer MS Windows computer older file system old version Windows supported addition file system normal file system recent version Windows
Each system advantage disadvantage
Standard FAT allows file name plus extension space example whereas NTFS allows much longer name contain space
You call file NTFS FAT would restricted something like unless using FAT extension allowing long file name
program utility program allow user manipulate file directly
They allow move create delete rename file folder although actually allow read content file store information
Every computer system provides least one program native file system
For example File Explorer formerly Windows Explorer commonly used Microsoft Windows operating system Nautilus common several distribution Linux

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

Unix group used share file CS department user
Each user CS public machine associated list containing least one group file directory CS public machine associated exactly one group
This usually referred group membership group ownership respectively
That user group file owned group
Users automatically added one group account creation
Maintaining group membership handled CS Staff
If need added removed group please send email group name action would like taken
Managing group ownership file directory requires action user
All file directory owned user created
In addition owned user file directory owned group
It important group ownership correct ever want share file group
Group ownership imply group access must set file access permission group use file
Permissions set restrict type access group member directory file
You use different Unix group share file different set user
Users organized group every user least one group may group
Group membership give special access file directory belonging group
Every user primary login group may several secondary group
The user said group group name list group
You logged group
When logged assigned group called current group
You see group list group list user group command
For example list group cmmiller first group primary group
If type group get group
Unix system using NFS allow membership total group
If see group list may experience problem accessing file group
Every file directory username groupname associated
There command managing group ownership directory file
In example command even document use filename indicate name file case use command name directory
The long format listing command give permission bit owner group file directory
Use l filename command get listing single file directory
The command l l list file directory current directory
The one beginning directory
When file directory first created take group current group shell
This default group login shell start another shell group using command project
If going create file secondary group easier create file shell started newgrp command
If want change group associated file directory already exists use command project filename
You must owner file must member new group order make change
In many case group ownership matter want share file group important get ownership correct
Otherwise may inviting user put large file directory
Just setting file owned group give group access file
Granting limiting access done setting appropriate permission bit
You see permission bit set letter dash long listing file directory using command
The option l command list information directory file long format
Without file directory would listed instead directory asked
For example get long listing directory name test The first string character mode next link count see l detail third field owner fourth field group owns file
mode Begins indicates directory
The owner cmmiller permission bit rwx full access
Any user group csstaff permission bit browsing access read search without permission add rename delete file directory
Every user cmmiller group csstaff permission bit access
count There three file directory
The count usually one listing file
username cmmiller The user login name cmmiller owner file
The owner permission mode according first three code
The owner always change permission mode chmod command
groupname csstaff The directory said owned group
Any user group csstaff except cmmiller permission granted according middle three code permission mode
The first group group list primary group
The first group listed primary group
That may group belong
The current group csstaff
Use exit command exit shell current group restored newgrp command
The command syntax enable member group read file name file want share
The file readable group associated file
Once check make sure directory file owned correct group set permission mode everything one command name directory contains file want share
The chmod command also used allow member group put file directory
The owner directory open directory shared writing command name directory want member group create file
The group setting mean new file group owned user putting group ownership set match group directory rather current group owner
This recommended way keep group ownership correct
The make sticky directory
This mean owner file owner directory delete rename file
This recommended several user putting file directory
name group would like share file named
Whereas chmod command determines type access group member may file directory chgrp command determines group may access file directory
list file directory current directory
You use command verify You use UNIX group share unlimited number file ongoing basis others CS UNIX account member UNIX group
One common mistake sharing file UNIX system forget set file permission set incorrectly
If permission set correctly user see following message similar one try access directory file Permission Denied good group name since user group
Another common problem set file permission existing file neglect set permission newly created file
By default others access file
You must give explicit permission file created

Science concerted human effort understand understand better history natural world natural world work observable physical evidence basis understanding
It done observation natural phenomenon experimentation try simulate natural process controlled condition
There course
Consider example
An ecologist observing territorial behavior bluebird geologist examining distribution fossil outcrop scientist making observation order find pattern natural phenomenon
They outdoors thus entertain general public behavior
An astrophysicist photographing distant galaxy climatologist sifting data weather balloon similarly also scientist making observation discrete setting
The example observational science also experimental science
A chemist observing rate one chemical reaction variety temperature nuclear physicist recording result bombardment particular kind matter neutron scientist performing experiment see consistent pattern emerge
A biologist observing reaction particular tissue various stimulant likewise experimenting find pattern behavior
These folk usually work lab wear impressive white lab coat seems mean make money
So people described
In case collecting information test new idea disprove old one
Scientists become famous discovering new thing change think nature whether discovery new specie dinosaur new way atom bond
Many scientist find greatest joy previously unknown fact discovery explains something problem previously explained overturn previously accepted idea
That answer based noble principle probably explains many people go science career
On pragmatic level people also science earn paycheck
Professors university many college expected part contractual obligation employment research make new contribution knowledge
If lose job least get lousy raise
Scientists also work corporation paid generate new knowledge particular chemical affect growth soybean petroleum form deep earth
These scientist get paid better may work obscurity knowledge generate kept secret employer development new product technology
If idea help explain individual science one might still wonder society nation pay individual science
Why society devote resource business developing new knowledge natural world motivated scientist devote life developing new knowledge
One realm answer lie desire improve people life
Geneticists trying understand certain condition passed generation generation biologist tracing pathway disease transmitted clearly seeking information may better life ordinary people
Earth scientist developing better model prediction weather prediction earthquake landslide volcanic eruption likewise seeking knowledge help avoid hardship plagued humanity century
Any society concerned welfare people least democratic society support effort like better people life
Another realm answer lie society desire economic development
Many earth scientist devote work finding efficient effective way discover recover natural resource like petroleum ore
Plant scientist seeking strain specie fruiting plant crop ultimately working increase agricultural output nutritionally literally enriches nation
Chemists developing new chemical substance potential technological application physicist developing new phenomenon like superconductivity likewise developing knowledge may spur economic development
In world nation increasingly view caught economic competition support science nothing le investment economic future
Another whole realm answer lie humanity increasing control planet environment

As friend Megacorp illustrate research lab field may science necessarily contribution knowledge
No one scientific community know place much confidence piece scientific research published journal
They may hear new research meeting learn grapevine newsgroups nothing taken seriously publication data
That mean ecologist write paper called manuscript rather reason
In manuscript justifies particular piece research significant detail method used report exactly observed result explains observation mean relative already known
She sends manuscript editor scientific journal send two three expert review
If expert report back research done methodologically sound way result contribute new useful knowledge editor approves publication although almost inevitably change addition
Within month hope paper appears new issue journal scientist around world learn ecologist finding
They decide whether think method used adequate whether result mean something new exciting gradually paper change way people think world
Of course subtlety business
If manuscript sent prestigious journal like competition publication mean editor select think manuscript reject rest even though manuscript science
The author rejected manuscript send work somewhat le exalted journal manuscript probably get published read somewhat smaller audience
At end spectrum may editor get relatively submission ca picky accepts journal many people read
For better worse scientist likely read likely accept work published major journal regional journal small circulation
If scientist constantly trying make new discovery develop new concept theory body knowledge produced science undergo constant change
Such change progress toward better understanding nature
It achieved constantly questioning whether current idea correct
As famous American astronomer Maria Mitchell put Question everything
The result theory come go least modified time old idea questioned new evidence discovered
In word Karl Popper Science history corrected mistake even Albert Einstein remarked That fellow Einstein


every year retracts wrote year
Many scientist remarked would like return life century see new knowledge new idea developed see century idea discarded
Our idea today compatible evidence hope idea survive test future
However look history force u realize future likely provide new evidence lead least somewhat different interpretation
Some scientist become sufficiently refuse accept new evidence new idea
In case word one pundit science advance funeral funeral
However scientist realize today theory probably future outmoded idea best hope theory survive tinkering future generation
We go back Copernicus illustrate
Most u today asked street corner would say accept Copernicus idea earth move around sun would say heliocentric theory seems correct
However Copernicus maintained orbit planet around sun perfectly circular
A couple century later Newton time became apparent orbit ellipsis
The heliocentric theory discarded modified account detailed new observation
In twentieth century additionally found exact shape ellipsis constant hence Milankovitch cycle may influenced periodicity glaciation
However gone back idea universe
Instead still accept heliocentric theory one modified time new data emerged
The notion scientific idea change expected change sometimes lost vociferous critic science
One good example Big Bang theory
Every new astronomical discovery seems prompt someone say See Big Bang theory predict whole thing must wrong
Instead discovery prompt change usually minor one theory
However astrophysicist tinkered theory detail enough account new discovery critic say See Big Bang theory discarded
Instead modified account new data exactly said ought happen time scientific idea
So mean
It mean science presently probably never give statement absolute eternal truth provides theory
We know theory probably refined future may even discarded favor theory make sense light data generated future scientist
However present theory best available explanation world
They explain tested vast amount information
Consider information tested theory This leaf people choice today
One option accept perhaps skepticism scientific theoretical understanding natural world derived observation measurement described
The option perhaps option accept traditional understanding natural world developed century even millennium ago people regardless wise sharp eye fertile imagination best tool
Onward

Testing essential part software development
It need approached systematic way mindful consequence error program solution
Functional testing mean preparing test data cover input output program function
It done independently code developed
Structural testing derived code developed
It mean preparing test data ensures every line code path execution covered
This however show missing code
Normal test data data handled program
It generate error calculation program make based value checked accuracy
It obvious thing check program work expected
Boundary data data lie boundary one response program another
For example might program calculates discount order say
Test data prepared ensure value boundary tested
The difference important
You test program responds appropriately
A good program caters kind input error occur commonly
This could failure enter valid date mistyping input entering wrong type data pressing enter without entering anything etc
A decent program validates input prompt user correct mistake
Test data deal likely scenario
A test plan best created table following heading In examination later piece coursework would expected include sample testing evidence conducted particular test
The number allow screenshot evidence testing plan made

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
The name overall process developing start finish
When starting new software project important plan developed maintained
There different theory develop test software
The process known cycle even piece software finished might necessary go back beginning
For example might possible update software based new piece technology become available
You might able make big change software work continue development cycle
The following key stage cycle There three typical type maintenance You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip

Software testing give independent view software allow business understand risk implementating software
The software Test system limited executing program application finding software bug existing software developed one created customer request
Software Testing also define process validating verifying software programe application product meet business requirement helped design developthe software testing occur requirement fulfilled system developed execution programe
The software testing mostly done professional software tester
The software tester term used generally software tester term became proper separate profession
In software testing many role established like Managers test lead test designer tester test administrator
The functional testing normally take test vereify specific function code also action kind testing normally found documentation code functional testing software normally take answer following question
user ables particular part codeing feature work
The Non functional testing normally take test software could related specific function user Non functional testing normally take answer following question example many user log possible hack software easly
The software testing take place association validation verification software
Verification The verification software testing mean know Software developed built example fulfill match user requirement specification software
Validation The validation software mean built right software customer want built
There issoftware testing approach taken perform software testing
The Box approach The box approach manly divide two part Black box testing white box testing The black box testing treat software black box mean testing take without knowing knowledge internal implementation Black box testing approach testing model based testing specification based testing
testing The specification testing use test functionalty software system according software tester input data able see output test type testing normally requires test case provided tester tester verify data given input output testing either expected
The specification testing important necessary would good certain risk
The white box testing another method test white box testing method done tester internal access data structure programe code implement type white box testing API Testing The API stand application programming interface API testing test application using public private API
Code Coverage Tsting This testing purpose test code example The software tester take test programming code execute testing software
Fault Ijection Testing This testing purpose improve code coverage
Static testing In static testing testing took white box testing static testing
There testing level Unit Testing The unit test take test functionality particular section programe testing normally takeing functional level example In Object Oriented language testing taken class level unit test object oriented include destructor test normally written tester work coding make sure every specific part codeing working testing could many test taken one fuction unit testing test functionalty software work unit testing also called component testing
Integration testing The integration testing type software testing verify interface component software design
The component software could integrated repertation process together integration software testing test find defect interface interaction integrated component
The large number software tester group test element design system test software work perfectly
System Testing The system testing test complete system make sure software fulfill requirement
System Integration Testing The system integration testing third party external member want intergate system able system define system requirement
Alpha Testing The alpha testing done end user customer independent mean actual user going use software test software developer alpha testing normally done software go sale handing shelf testing software go beta testing Beta Testing The beta testing take alpha beta testing mean software release limited people outside developer check functionalty purpose testing testing take find bug beta version software release open public get feedback maximum number people
Security Testing The security testing important software process personal detail customer data security important prevent system hacker
There commonly used cycle sample commonly used organisation using waterfall development model
Requirements analysis This phase begin requirement phase software development life design phase tester work software developer determine design software testable
Test Planning The test planning test plan many test taken plan testing
Test Development The test developer Test procedure test data use testing software
Test Execution The tester execute software based plan report bug error developer
Test Reporting In phase testing completed tester make final report test taken throw many phase report show whether software ready release
Test result analysis The test result analysis Defect Analysis normally done developer client make sure defect example software working properly could done later
Defect Retesting In phase defect dealt developer bw retested testing team

So made piece software finished unit integration testing I need system testing
I read System testing testing whole system requirement specification integration testing finished
need know component executed rather must know system supposed
Thus function testing based system functional requirement
My question usually carried profesionally documented
It vague term Actually really vague merely difficult
Here idea done
It rarely shipping product far important shipping quality product
Determining item important homework
Hello I got node
look like C Files If start tool double click Hello professional try make tool colleague
I got XMLTreeView form load want display image folder work change code work

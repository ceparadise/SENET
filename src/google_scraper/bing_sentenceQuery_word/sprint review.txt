This informal meeting status meeting presentation Increment intended elicit feedback foster collaboration
This meeting Sprints
For shorter Sprints event usually shorter
The ensures event take place attendee understand purpose
The Scrum Master teach everyone involved keep within
The Sprint Review includes following element The result Sprint Review revised Product Backlog defines probable Product Backlog item next Sprint
The Product Backlog may also adjusted overall meet new opportunity

framework managing work emphasis
It designed team three nine developer break work action completed within timeboxed iteration called typically track progress called
Approaches coordinating work multiple scrum team larger organization include among others
Scrum iterative incremental framework managing product development
It defines flexible product development strategy development team work unit reach common goal challenge assumption traditional sequential approach product development enables team encouraging physical close online collaboration team member well daily communication among team member discipline involved
A key principle Scrum dual recognition customer change mind want need often called requirement volatility unpredictable predictive planned approach suited
As Scrum adopts problem fully understood defined front instead focusing maximize team ability deliver quickly respond emerging requirement adapt evolving technology change market condition
Many term used Scrum scrum master typically written leading capital Scrum Master conjoint word written ScrumMaster
To maintain encyclopedic tone however article us normal sentence case recognized mark
This occasionally seen written SCRUM
The word correct however likely arose due early paper Ken Schwaber capitalized SCRUM title
While term Scrum allowed lapse deemed owned wider community rather individual leading capital used word
Hirotaka Takeuchi introduced term scrum context article New New Product Development Game
Takeuchi Nonaka later argued The Knowledge Creating Company form organizational knowledge creation especially good bringing innovation continuously incrementally spirally
The author described new approach commercial product development would increase speed flexibility based case study manufacturing firm automotive photocopier printer
They called approach whole process performed one across multiple overlapping phase team try go distance unit passing ball back forth
In used restart play forward team interlock head attempt gain possession ball
In early used would become Scrum company Advanced Development Methods John Scumniotales Jeff McKenna developed similar approach Easel Corporation referring using single word Scrum
In Sutherland Schwaber jointly presented paper describing Scrum framework Business Object Design Implementation Workshop held part OOPSLA Austin Texas
Over following year Schwaber Sutherland collaborated combine experience evolving good develop became known Scrum
In Schwaber worked Mike Beedle describe method book
Scrum approach planning managing product development involves bringing authority level operation property certainty
In Schwaber others founded Scrum Alliance set accreditation series
Schwaber left Scrum Alliance late founded oversees parallel accreditation series
Since public document called defines sort official version Scrum occasionally revised
There three core role Scrum framework
These ideally deliver potentially shippable product increment every sprint
Together three role form scrum team
While many organization role involved defining delivering product Scrum defines three
The product owner represents product accountable ensuring team delivers value business
The product owner defines product term typically add based importance dependency
Scrum team one product owner
This role combined scrum master
The product owner focus business side product development spend majority time liaising stakeholder dictate team reach technical solution
This role equivalent role agile framework XP
Communication core responsibility product owner
The ability convey priority empathize team member stakeholder vital steer product development right direction
The product owner role bridge communication gap team stakeholder serving proxy stakeholder team team representative overall stakeholder community
As face team stakeholder following communication task product owner stakeholder Empathy key attribute product owner ability put one self another shoe
A product owner converse different stakeholder variety background job role objective
A product owner must able see different point view
To effective wise product owner know level detail audience need
The development team need thorough feedback specification build product expectation executive sponsor may need summary progress
Providing information necessary may lose stakeholder interest waste time
A direct mean communication preferred seasoned agile product owner
A product owner ability communicate effectively also enhanced skilled technique identify stakeholder need negotiate priority stakeholder interest collaborate developer ensure effective implementation requirement
The development team responsible delivering potentially shippable product increment every sprint sprint goal
The team three nine member carry task required build product increment analysis design development testing technical writing etc
Although several discipline represented team member referred generically
To avoid potential confusion refers programmer organization call member
The development team Scrum even though may interaction role outside team PMO
Scrum facilitated scrum master accountable removing impediment ability team deliver product goal deliverable
The scrum master traditional act buffer team distracting influence
The scrum master ensures Scrum framework followed
The scrum master help ensure team follows agreed process Scrum framework often facilitates key session encourages team improve
The role also referred team facilitator reinforce dual perspective
The core responsibility scrum master include limited One way scrum master role differs project manager latter may responsibility scrum master
Scrum formally recognise role project manager traditional command control tendency would cause difficulty
A sprint iteration basic unit development Scrum
The sprint effort restricted specific duration
The duration fixed advance sprint normally one week one month two week common
Each sprint start sprint planning event aim define sprint backlog identify work sprint make estimated forecast sprint goal
Each sprint end sprint review sprint retrospective review progress show stakeholder identify lesson improvement next sprint
Scrum emphasizes working product end sprint really done
In case software likely includes software fully integrated tested documented potentially shippable
At beginning sprint scrum team hold sprint planning event Each day sprint team hold daily scrum specific guideline Any impediment stumbling block risk issue delayed dependency assumption proved unfounded identified daily scrum captured scrum master displayed team scrum board shared risk board agreed person designated working toward resolution outside daily scrum
No detailed discussion happen daily scrum
At end sprint team hold two event sprint review sprint retrospective
At sprint review team Guidelines sprint review At sprint retrospective team Guidelines sprint retrospective The following activity commonly done although considered core part Scrum Backlog refinement called backlog grooming ongoing process reviewing product backlog item checking appropriately prioritised prepared way make clear executable team enter sprint via sprint planning activity
Product backlog item may broken multiple smaller one acceptance criterion may clarified dependency investigation preparatory work may identified agreed technical spike
Although originally core Scrum practice backlog refinement added scrum guide adopted way managing quality product backlog item entering sprint recommended investment team sprint capacity
The backlog also include technical debt also known design debt code debt
This concept software development reflects implied cost additional rework caused choosing easy solution instead using better approach would take longer
The product owner cancel sprint necessary
The product owner may input team scrum master management
For instance management may wish product owner cancel sprint external circumstance negate value sprint goal
If sprint abnormally terminated next step conduct new sprint planning reason termination reviewed
The product backlog comprises ordered list scrum team maintains
It consists must done successfully deliver viable product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item PBIs based consideration risk business value dependency size date needed
Items added backlog commonly written story format
The product backlog delivered ordered sequence delivered
It visible everyone may changed consent product owner ultimately responsible ordering product backlog item development team choose
The product backlog contains product owner assessment business value development team assessment development effort often always stated using
These estimate help product owner gauge timeline may influence ordering product backlog item example two feature business value product owner may schedule earlier delivery one lower development effort higher one higher development effort complex riskier want retire risk earlier
The product backlog business value product backlog item responsibility product owner
The size
estimated complexity effort item however determined development team contributes sizing story point estimated hour
There common misunderstanding allowed product backlog
By contrast Scrum neutral requirement technique
As Scrum primer state product backlog item articulated way clear sustainable
Contrary popular misunderstanding product backlog contain user story simply contains item
Those item expressed user story requirement approach group find useful
But whatever approach item focus delivering value customer
Scrum advocate role product owner assigned
The product owner responsible maximizing value product
The product owner gather input take feedback lobbied many people ultimately make call get built
The product backlog Typically product owner scrum team come together write everything must prioritized becomes content first block time meant focused work selected item accommodated within timeframe
The product backlog evolve new information surface product customer later sprint may address new work
The following item typically comprise product backlog feature bug technical work knowledge acquisition
A feature wanted bug unintended unwanted may necessarily something defective
An example technical work could run virus check developer workstation
An example knowledge acquisition could research Wordpress plugin library making selection
A product backlog simplest form merely list item work
Having rule work added removed ordered help whole team make better decision change product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item based needed soonest
The team chooses item complete coming sprint
On scrum board team move item product backlog sprint backlog list item build
Conceptually ideal team select think accomplish top list unusual see practice team able take item list along top one selected
This normally happens time left within sprint accommodate work
Items top backlog item work first broken story suitable development team work
The backlog go le refined item
As Schwaber Beedle put The lower priority le detail barely make backlog item
As team work backlog must assumed change happens outside team learn new market opportunity take advantage competitor threat arise feedback customer change way product meant work
All new idea tend trigger team adapt backlog incorporate new knowledge
This part fundamental mindset agile team
The world change backlog never finished
The sprint backlog list work development team must address next sprint
The list derived scrum team progressively selecting product backlog item priority order top product backlog feel enough work fill sprint
The development team keep mind past performance assessing capacity new sprint use guide line much complete
The product backlog item may broken task development team
Tasks sprint backlog never assigned rather task signed team member needed according set priority skill team
This promotes development team developer
The sprint backlog property development team included estimate provided development team
Often accompanying task board used see change state task current sprint like progress done
Once sprint backlog committed additional work added sprint backlog except team
Once sprint delivered product backlog analyzed reprioritized necessary next set functionality selected next sprint
The increment potentially shippable increment PSI sum product backlog item completed sprint integrated work previous sprint
At end sprint increment must complete according scrum team definition done DoD fully functioning usable condition regardless whether product owner decides actually release
The following artifact commonly used although considered core part Scrum The sprint chart public displayed chart showing remaining work sprint backlog
Updated every day give simple view sprint progress
It also provides quick visualization reference
The horizontal axis sprint chart show day sprint vertical axis show amount work remaining day typically representing estimate hour work remaining
During sprint planning ideal burndown chart plotted
Then sprint member pick task sprint backlog work
At end day update remaining hour task completed
In way actual burndown chart updated day day
It confused
The release chart way team provide visibility track progress toward release
Updated end sprint show progress toward delivering forecast scope
The horizontal axis release chart show sprint release vertical axis show amount work completed end sprint typically representing cumulative story point work completed
Progress plotted line grows meet horizontal line represents forecast scope often shown forecast based progress date indicates much scope might completed given release date many sprint take complete given scope
The release chart make easy see much work completed much work added removed horizontal scope line move much work left done
The determine whether product backlog item complete
In many case DoD requires successful
The definition done may vary one scrum team another must consistent within one team
The total effort team capable sprint
The number derived evaluating work typically point completed last sprint
The collection historical velocity data guideline assisting team understanding much work likely achieve future sprint
A period used research concept create simple prototype
Spikes either planned take place sprint larger team spike might accepted one many sprint delivery objective
Spikes often introduced delivery large complex product backlog item order secure budget expand knowledge produce proof concept
The duration objective spike agreed product owner development team start
Unlike sprint commitment spike may may deliver tangible shippable valuable functionality
For example objective spike might successfully reach decision course action
The spike time necessarily objective delivered
Also called drone spike tracer bullet spike current architecture current technology set current set best practice result production quality code
It might narrow implementation functionality throwaway code
It production quality rest iteration build code
The name military origin make path bullet visible allowing correction
Often implementation shot layer application connecting single form input field prove layer connect expected
Scrum work le well following circumstance From business perspective Scrum many virtue one designed yield best business solution
However efficiency given organization vary widely largely dependent ability organization adhere implementation guideline article
Every company distinct organizational structure culture set business practice naturally amenable methodology others
Like agile method effective adoption Scrum supported wide range tool
Many company use universal tool spreadsheet build maintain artifact sprint backlog
There also proprietary software package either dedicated product development using Scrum framework support multiple product development approach including Scrum
Other organization implement Scrum without software tool maintain artifact form paper whiteboards sticky note
Scrum empirical approach like empirical process control underpinned three pillar transparency inspection adaptation
All work within Scrum framework visible responsible outcome process workflow progress etc
In order make thing visible scrum team need frequently inspect product developed well team working
With frequent inspection team spot work deviate outside acceptable limit adapt process product development
These three pillar require trust openness team following five value Scrum enable The hybridization Scrum software development methodology common Scrum cover whole therefore organization find need add additional process create comprehensive implementation
For example start product development organization commonly add process guidance business case requirement gathering prioritization initial design budget schedule forecasting
Various author community people use Scrum also suggested detailed technique apply adapt Scrum particular problem organization
Many refer methodological technique analogy architecture software
Such pattern extended Scrum outside software development domain Manufacturing Finance
Scrumban software production model based Scrum
Scrumban especially suited frequent unexpected work item programming error
In case sprint Scrum framework may perceived le benefit although Scrum daily event practice still applied depending team situation hand
Visualization work stage limitation simultaneous unfinished work defect familiar Kanban model
Using method team directed way allows minimum completion time work item programming error hand ensures team member constantly employed
To illustrate stage work team working space often use note large whiteboard
In case decentralized team software
The major difference Scrum Kanban Scrum work divided sprint last fixed amount time whereas Kanban flow work continuous
This visible work stage table Scrum emptied sprint whereas Kanban task marked table
Scrum focus team multifaceted whereas Kanban make specialized functional team possible
The scrum scrum technique operate Scrum scale multiple team working product allowing discus progress interdependency focusing coordinate delivering software especially area overlap integration
Depending cadence timing scrum scrum relevant daily scrum scrum team end designating one member ambassador participate scrum scrum ambassador team
Depending context ambassador may technical contributor team scrum master
Rather simply progress update scrum scrum focus team collectively working resolve mitigate accept risk impediment dependency assumption RIDAs identified
The scrum scrum track RIDAs via backlog risk board sometimes known initial resolved owned accepted mitigated typically lead greater coordination collaboration team
This run similar daily scrum ambassador answering following four question As commented Since I originally defined Scrum Scrums Ken Schwaber IDX working I definitively say Scrum Scrums meta Scrum
The Scrum Scrums I used responsible delivering working software team Definition Done end sprint release sprint
PatientKeeper delivered production four time per Sprint
delivers production time per Sprint
Hubspot delivers live software time day
The Scrum Scrums Master held accountable making work
So Scrum Scrums operational delivery mechanism
scrum LeSS product development framework extends Scrum scaling rule guideline without losing original purpose Scrum
There two level framework first LeSS level designed team second level known LeSS Huge introduces additional scaling element development hundred developer
Scaling Scrum start understanding able adopt standard real Scrum
Scrum requires examining purpose Scrum element figuring reach purpose staying within constraint standard Scrum rule
Bas Vodde evolved LeSS framework experience working product development especially telecom finance industry
It evolved taking Scrum trying many different experiment discover work
In experiment solidified LeSS framework rule
The intention LeSS descale organization complexity dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solution solving simpler way
Less role le management le organizational structure

What difference Scrum Agile Development
Are Sprint Iterations
Scrum one many iterative incremental agile software development method
You find detailed description process
In SCRUM methodology sprint basic unit development
Each sprint start planning meeting task sprint identified estimated commitment sprint goal made
A Sprint end review retrospective meeting progress reviewed lesson next sprint identified
During sprint team creates finished portion product
In Agile method iteration involves team working full software development cycle including planning requirement analysis design coding unit testing acceptance testing working product demonstrated stakeholder
So SCRUM sprint perform software development phase requirement analysis acceptance testing opinion say SCRUM sprint correspond AGILE iteration
As mentioned others Scrum iterative incremental agile software development method managing software project product application development
So Scrum fact type Agile approach used widely software development
So Scrum specific flavor Agile specifically referred agile project management framework
Also Scrum mainly two role inside
Role
Ancillary Role role It consists mainly three role
Scrum Master b
Product Owner c
Development Team
Ancillary Role The ancillary role Scrum team formal role infrequent involvement Scrum procession nonetheless must taken account
viz
Stakeholders Managers
Scrum Master There type meeting scrum Let know one need input
How Scrum fit Agile Development
While Agile methodology applied product development software industry industry well Scrum specific software development
Scrum methodology
It simply provides structure discipline framework Agile development
The whole project made series Sprints Sprint Cycles n Sprint duration
If denoted T Tn
Sprints could anywhere week
Sprints shorter week ideal used le frequently
At end Sprint functional working piece software produced user actually test
Original article SCRUM SCRUM type Agile approach
It Framework Methodology
It provide detailed instruction need done rather dependent team developing software
Because developing project know problem solved much left team essential case scrum
There team leader case assign task team member rather whole team address issue problem
It way everyone involved project right idea implementation project
The advantage scrum direction adjusted based completed work speculation prediction
Roles Involved Product Owner Scrum Master Team Members Agile Methodology Build Software application unpredictable nature Iterative incremental work cadence called sprint used methodology
Both Agile SCRUM follows system feature developed part sprint end sprint feature completed right coding testing integration product
A demonstration functionality provided owner end sprint feedback taken helpful next sprint
Manifesto Agile Development That value item right value item left
Agile Scrum term used project management
The Agile methodology employ incremental iterative work beat also called sprint
Scrum hand type agile approach used software development
Agile practice Scrum process following practice eXtreme Programming XP Kanban alternative process following Agile development practice
Waterfall methodology sequential design process
This mean eight stage conception initiation analysis design construction testing implementation maintenance completed developer move next step
As process sequential step completed developer go back previous step without scratching whole project starting beginning
room change error project outcome extensive plan must set beginning followed careful came disadvantage waterfall methodology
Instead sequential design process Agile methodology follows incremental approach
Developers start simplistic project design begin work small module
The work module done weekly monthly sprint end sprint project priority evaluated test run
These sprint allow bug discovered customer feedback incorporated design next sprint run
The process lack initial design step often criticized collaborative nature focus principle rather process
At outset I say Agile evolutionary methodology Unified Process focus Iterative Incremental Development IID
IID emphasizes iterative development construction phase actual coding incremental delivery
It would emphasize Requirements Analysis Inception Design Elaboration handled iteration
So Iteration mini project
In Agile take IDD bit adding reality like Team Collaboration Evolutionary Requirements Design etc
And SCRUM tool enable considering human factor building around Group principle
So Sprint mini project bettering pure IID model
So iteration implemented Agile way yes theoretically Sprints highlighting size iteration small delivery quick
I really differentiate Agile SCRUM I see SCRUM natural way putting Agile principle use

After Sprint execution team hold Sprint Review Meeting demonstrate working product increment Product Owner everyone else interested
The meeting feature live demonstration report
After demonstration Product Owner review commitment made Sprint Planning Meeting declares item considers
For example software item merely code complete considered untested software shippable
Incomplete item returned Product Backlog ranked according Product Owner revised priority candidate future Sprints
The help Product Owner stakeholder convert feedback new prioritization Product Owner
Often new scope discovery outpaces team rate development
If Product Owner feel newly discovered scope important original expectation new scope displaces old scope Product Backlog
The Sprint Review Meeting appropriate meeting external stakeholder even end user attend
It opportunity inspect adapt product emerges iteratively refine everyone understanding requirement
New product particularly software product hard visualize vacuum
Many customer need able react piece functioning software discover actually want
Iterative development approach allows creation product specified front approach

The Sprint Review point end Sprint
During Sprint Review customer stakeholder examine team built Sprint discus change new idea
Together Teams Product Owner decide direction product
The Sprint Review occasion team review potentially shippable Product Increment together
The focus
The common mistake Sprint Review focus Product Owner accepting item team
This misunderstanding purpose Sprint Review move away towards finding blame
The Sprint Review opportunity everyone collaborate product
The Sprint Review best conducted using meeting pattern
During diverge period use bazaar
This analogous science fair A large room multiple area staffed team representative item developed team shown discussed
Stakeholders visit area interest
During converge period stakeholder summarize opinion bazaar

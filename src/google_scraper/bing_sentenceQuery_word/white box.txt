In without
For instance term applies system assembled small system assembled end user part purchased separately retail
In latter sense building white box system part movement
The term also applied high volume production unbranded began MHz system selling
Because like standard whole range part obtained individually many computer shop assembled home minimum tool technical skill
Alternatively shop may assemble component complete machine modest additional cost
Similarly term whitebook denotes assembled part
Computer professional intensive computer user especially often prefer white box computer constructed higher quality component specify opposed lower cost generic component often found general purpose PCs
For user performance longevity expansion capability compatibility take precedence achieving absolute lowest cost use cheapest possible component
In around personal computer sold annually white box system
Although saving money common motivation building one PC today generally expensive build PC buy equivalent
While PCs built system manufacturer generally come white box large small system vendor channel ordered without OS
Usually ordered operating system system builder us copy OS
white box PCs still popular among user operating system ensure hardware support avoid though manufacturer offer
Intel Corporation defined interconnection standard notebook computer component including Barebones chassis battery pack keyboard adapter
These building block primarily marketed computer building company rather user

Also known
A testing technique whereby explicit knowledge internal working item tested used select test data
Unlike white box testing us specific knowledge programming examine output
The test accurate tester know program supposed
He see program diverges intended goal
White box testing account error caused omission visible code must also readable
For complete software examination white box black box test required

also known method testing test internal structure working application opposed functionality

In testing internal perspective system well programming skill used design test case
The tester chooses input exercise path code determine expected output
This analogous testing node circuit
ICT
testing applied level process
Although traditional tester tended think testing done unit level used integration system testing frequently today
It test path within unit path unit integration subsystem test
Though method test design uncover many error problem potential miss unimplemented part specification missing requirement
test design technique include following criterion testing method testing application level source code
These test case derived use design technique mentioned testing data flow testing branch testing path testing statement coverage decision coverage well modified coverage
testing use technique guideline create environment examining fragile code
These testing technique building block testing whose essence careful testing application source code level prevent hidden error later
These different technique exercise every visible path source code minimize error create environment
The whole point testing ability know line code executed able identify correct output
testing basic procedure require tester knowledge source code tested
The programmer must deep understanding application know kind test case create every visible path exercised testing
Once source code understood source code analyzed test case created
The following three basic step testing take order create test case testing one two biggest testing methodology used today
It several major advantage Although testing great advantage perfect contains disadvantage A modern view dichotomy testing testing blurred becoming le relevant
Whereas originally meant using source code meant using requirement test derived many document various level abstraction
The real point test usually designed abstract structure input space graph logical predicate question level abstraction derive abstract structure
That source code requirement input space description one dozen type design model
Therefore distinction le important term le relevant
In testing refers methodology full knowledge system attacked
The goal penetration test simulate malicious insider knowledge possibly basic credential target system

Also known
A testing technique whereby internal working item tested known tester
For example black box test software design tester know input expected outcome program arrives output
The tester ever examine programming need knowledge program specification
The advantage type testing include The disadvantage type testing include For complete software examination black box test required

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

A white hat hacker computer security specialist break protected system network test ass security
White hat hacker use skill improve security exposing vulnerability malicious hacker known black hat hacker detect exploit
Although method used similar identical employed malicious hacker white hat hacker permission employ organization hired
White hat hacker usually seen hacker use skill benefit society
They may reformed black hat hacker may simply method technique used hacker
An organization hire consultant test implement best practice make le vulnerable malicious hacking attempt future
For part term synonymous ethical hacker
The term come old Western movie cliché good guy wear white cowboy hat
Of course bad guy always seemed wear black hat

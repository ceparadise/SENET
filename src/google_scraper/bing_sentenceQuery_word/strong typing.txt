In often colloquially classified whether language make
These term precise definition general strongly typed language stricter typing rule likely generate error refuse compile argument passed function closely match expected type
On hand weakly typed language looser typing rule may produce unpredictable result may perform implicit type conversion
A different related concept
In Zilles defined language one whenever object passed calling function called function type must compatible type declared called function
In Jackson wrote In strongly typed language data area distinct type process state communication requirement term type
A number different language design decision referred evidence strong weak typing
In fact many accurately understood presence absence
Strong typing generally refers use programming language type order capture invariant code ensure correctness definitely exclude certain class programming error
Thus many strong typing discipline used achieve goal
Some programming language make easy use value one type value another type
This sometimes described weak typing
For example Aahz Maruch opines occurs language use syntactic feature language force usage one type different type consider common use C
Coercion usually symptom weak typing
Conversion hand creates object appropriate type
As another example describes warns break strict
discus several problem arise cause make inappropriate
There many example language allow manner
For example C allow program define operator convert value one type another semantically meaningful way
When compiler encounter conversion treat operation like function call
In contrast converting value C type unsafe operation invisible compiler
Some programming language expose pointer numeric value allow user perform arithmetic
These language sometimes referred weakly typed since pointer arithmetic used bypass language type system
Some programming language support allow value one type viewed value another type
In article strong type system described one possibility unchecked runtime type error
In writing absence unchecked error referred early paper call property
Some programming language static
In many language easy write program would rejected static
For example variable might store either number Boolean value false
Note definition contradictory others merely conceptually independent still others special case additional constraint liberal le strong definition
Because wide divergence among definition possible defend claim programming language either strongly weakly typed
For instance For reason writer wish write unambiguously type system often eschew term strong typing favor specific expression

One property sometimes looked programming language
There confusion safety mean definition used year ad hoc committee recommended Advanced Placement AP test programming based programming language Java Any attempt misinterpret data caught compile time generates error runtime
C safe
An array index operation language may allowed even though outside range array
There also protection using pointer manipulation access almost part memory
Buffer overflow writing outside boundary exploited many computer virus
Of course programmer explicitly check overflow language require
In hand professional unsafe feature used advantage
But programmer language provides safety immense value
Especially beginning programmer safety help
Much safety enforced term well defined let explain mean
First type every variable every expression syntactic property looking program without resorting executing
Second variable may used way respect type example impossible perform double operation int value int value must first cast double format use boolean value integer
Thus syntactically impossible operation disregard type operand interpret value something
The strong typing Java backed strong guarantee runtime behavior goal ensure value interpreted something
With String value impossible index character String exist
For example cause exception range
Similarly array subscript must range array
Also impossible pointer arithmetic one C
In Java pointer call name object operation name
Some error arise lack understanding others logical error caused inadequate thinking design simply typo
In case finding error early compile time save immense amount time
Safety strong typing make possible early detection many error
The beginning programmer benefit safety strong typing professional programmer simply beginner tends make type error
But professional programmer also gain safe strongly type language
When program consists hundred file easy get confused make mistake check program better
Finally language like Java whose program accessed web page writing safety strong typing aid user well property make difficult malicious people hack system applet

learn share knowledge build career
I read several page including wiki page dealing strongly weakly typed language
For part I think I understand difference
However I would like straight point answer differentiating two
From understanding weakly typed language data type explicitly called
This would language like Matlab add without typecast
Strongly typed language require programmer declare data type variable value
For instance C would need something like int float ca remember valid C
Any information expanding correcting understanding concept would greatly appreciated
Check Eric Lippert blog
There entry looking
From look blog term subjective speak precisely type system feature
The difference declaring type variable
It bit subtle Eric Lippert think term reasonably
The distinction language
In untyped weakly typed critic dynamically typed fan language case
The language allows operation performed type rather substantial proviso operation may fail
That may allow operation may
Note possible language without requiring type declaration everywhere
Indeed language
Consider bit Java How compiler decide legal
It legal used
But declaration anything
Rather compiler know call get
It infers fact type legal ask
Some language whose type system sophisticated Java allow compiler infer
For example Scala say And compiler infer type well intermediate expression
Languages strong typing artificial limit type inference require redundant type declaration like Java described type must made manifest fancy way saying explicitly brought existence fancy way saying written
As said weakly typed language data type explicitly called
Strongly typed language require programmer declare data type variable value
This correct
There also sort paradigm called strongly typed language like c type declared necessary wanted programmer
C var type also strong type String Boolean etc many programmer use language prefer
In way language strongly weakly typed
I hope help understanding concept A strongly typed language check type variable performing operation whereas weakly typed language
Eg JAVA Strongly typed language C Weakly typed language By posting answer agree

In set rule assigns property called various construct
These type formalize enforce otherwise implicit category programmer us data structure component
string array float function returning boolean
The main purpose type system reduce possibility computer program defining interface different part computer program checking part connected consistent way
This checking happen statically dynamically combination static dynamic checking
Type system purpose well expressing business rule enabling certain compiler optimization allowing providing form documentation etc
A type system associate type computed value examining flow value attempt ensure prove occur
The given type system question determines exactly constitutes type error general aim prevent operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense also prevented
Type system often specified part built interpreter compiler although type system language extended perform added kind check using language original type syntax grammar
An example simple type system
The portion C program definition
One function invoked another function
The interface function state name function list value passed function code
The code invoking function state name invoked along name variable hold value pas
During execution value placed temporary storage execution jump code invoked function
The invoked function code access value make use
If instruction inside function written assumption receiving integer value calling code passed value wrong result computed invoked function
The C compiler check type declared variable sent type declared variable interface invoked function
If type match compiler throw error
A may also use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Formally study type system
A programming language must occurrence type check using whether compile time runtime manually annotated automatically inferred
As concisely put The fundamental problem addressed type theory ensure program meaning
The fundamental problem caused type theory meaningful program may meaning ascribed
The quest richer type system result tension
Assigning data type termed give meaning sequence value
The hardware unable discriminate example make intrinsic distinction possible value sequence bit might
Associating sequence bit type conveys programmable hardware form composed hardware program
A program associate value least one specific type also occur one value associated many
Other entity communication channel become associated type
Even type become associated type
An implementation could theory associate identification called type value type object metatype
These abstraction typing go hierarchy level contained system
When programming language evolves elaborate type system gain finely grained rule set basic type checking come price type inference property become attention must paid programmer annotate code consider operation functioning
It challenging find sufficiently expressive type system satisfies programming practice manner
The type restriction imposed compiler programming language
Strongly typed language often require programmer make explicit conversion context implicit conversion would cause harm
Pascal type system described strong example size array string part type making programming task difficult
also strongly typed type automatically inferred explicit conversion often always unnecessary
A programming language compiler also implement enables even program specification verified type checker
Beyond simple pair virtual region code associated effect component describing done enabling example throw error report
Thus symbolic system may endows safety checking type checking alone
Whether automated compiler specified programmer type system make program behavior illegal outside rule
Advantages provided type system include Advantages provided type system include Type safety contributes guarantee correctness cost making type checking
In automated type checking program may prove run incorrectly yet safely typed produce compiler error
unsafe incorrect operation type checker running scan division zero language left
To prove absence defect kind collectively known common use
Alternatively sufficiently expressive type system dependently typed language prevent kind error example expressing
In addition method finding error type checker detect
The process verifying enforcing constraint occur either static check
If language specification requires typing rule strongly le allowing automatic type conversion lose information one refer process
The term usually used strict sense
Static type checking process verifying program based analysis program text source code
If program pass static type checker program guaranteed satisfy set type safety property possible input
Static type checking considered limited form see language considered also optimization
If compiler prove program need emit dynamic safety check allowing resulting compiled binary run faster smaller
Static type checking language inherently conservative
That type system meaning reject incorrect program meaning possible write algorithm determines whether program must meaning correct program also rejected even though encounter runtime error
For example consider program containing code Even expression always evaluates type checker reject program difficult impossible static analyzer determine branch taken
Conversely static type checker quickly detect type error rarely used code path
Without static type checking even test coverage may unable find type error
The test may fail detect type error combination place value created place certain value used must taken account
A number useful common programming language feature checked statically
Thus many language static dynamic type checking static type checker verifies dynamic check verify rest
Many language static type checking provide way bypass type checker
Some language allow programmer choose static dynamic type safety
For example distinguishes variable
Uses former checked statically whereas us latter checked dynamically
Other language allow writing code
For example programmer freely cast value two type size
For list language static type checking see
Dynamic type checking process verifying type safety program runtime
Implementations dynamically language generally associate runtime object reference type containing type information
This runtime type information RTTI also used implement similar feature
Most language include form dynamic type checking even also static type checker
The reason many useful feature property difficult impossible verify statically
For example suppose program defines two type A B B subtype A
If program try convert value type A type B known operation legal value converted actually value type B
Thus dynamic check needed verify operation safe
This requirement one criticism downcasting
By definition dynamic type checking may cause program fail runtime
In programming language possible anticipate recover failure
In others error considered fatal
Programming language include dynamic type checking static type checking often called dynamically typed programming language
For list language see
Some language allow static dynamic typing type checking sometimes called typing
For example Java ostensibly statically typed language support type querying object discover dynamic type type operation depend runtime type information
More generally programming language include mechanism dispatching different data
Even interacting type annotation type checking mechanism materially similar dynamic typing implementation
See discussion interaction static dynamic typing
Objects object oriented language usually accessed reference whose static target type manifest type equal either object type latent type supertype thereof
This conformant state operation performed instance given type also performed instance subtype
This concept also known subsumption
In language subtypes may also posse return type argument type respectively
Certain language example dynamically default allow program opt static type checking providing optional annotation
One reason use hint would optimize performance critical section program
This formalized
The programming environment pedagogic environment based Lisp precursor language also
Conversely version C language provides way indicate variable statically
A variable whose type subject static type checking
Instead program relies runtime type information determine variable may used
The choice static dynamic typing requires certain
Static typing find type error reliably compile time increase reliability delivered program
However programmer disagree commonly type error occur resulting disagreement proportion bug coded would caught appropriately representing designed type code
Static typing advocate believe program reliable well whereas advocate point distributed code proven reliable small bug database
The value static typing presumably increase strength type system increased
Advocates implemented language suggested almost bug considered type error type used program properly declared programmer correctly inferred compiler
Static typing usually result compiled code executes faster
When compiler know exact data type use necessary static verification either declaration inference produce optimized machine code
Some dynamically typed language allow optional type declaration optimization reason
By contrast dynamic typing may allow compiler run faster dynamically load new code change source code dynamically typed language may result le checking perform le code revisit
This may reduce cycle
Statically typed language lack require programmer declare type method function must use
This serve added program documentation active dynamic instead static
This allows compiler prevent drifting synchrony ignored programmer
However language statically typed without requiring type declaration example include lesser extent explicit type declaration necessary requirement static typing language
Dynamic typing allows construct static type checking would reject illegal
For example function execute arbitrary data code become possible
An function possible static typing requires advanced us
Further dynamic typing better accommodates transitional code prototyping allowing placeholder data structure transparently used place full data structure usually purpose experimentation testing
Dynamic typing typically allows enables
Many language static typing also feature mechanism like also enable easier code reuse
Dynamic typing typically make easier use
For example typically cumbersome write equivalent code since stronger rule regarding type definition function variable
This force developer write boilerplate code template Python developer would need
More advanced construct often harder use statically typed language
In language feature may also used
generate new type behavior fly based data
Such advanced construct often provided many dynamically typed although need related
Languages often colloquially referred
In fact universally accepted definition term mean
In general precise term represent difference type system lead people call strong weak
A third way categorizing type system programming language us safety typed operation conversion
Computer scientist consider language allow operation conversion violate rule type system
Some observer use term describe language allow program access memory assigned use
For example language else statically guarantee compile time execution array access array boundary cause perhaps runtime error
Consider following program language In example variable value
Although may programmer anticipated result
If different string one could converted number
Hello World result would well
Note program still crash invalid operation fact program encounter operation terminating program often option
Now consider similar example C In example point memory address five character beyond equivalent three character terminating zero character string pointed
This memory program expected access
It may contain garbage data certainly contain anything useful
As example show C neither language
In general go hand hand
For example language support pointer arithmetic conversion like C neither allows arbitrary memory accessed valid memory type
For information see
Some language allow different level checking apply different region code
Examples include Additional tool also used achieve higher level strictness
It proposed chiefly choice type system made independent choice language type system module language needed
He belief advantageous call mandatory type system make language le expressive code fragile
The requirement type affect semantics language difficult fulfill
Optional typing related still distinct
The term refers ability code especially function class act value multiple type ability different instance data structure contain element different type
Type system allow polymorphism generally order improve potential code language polymorphism programmer need implement data structure list rather type element plan use
For reason computer scientist sometimes call use certain form polymorphism
The foundation polymorphism closely related case
In statement calling object rely declared type object object whatever type must supply implementation method called called
Duck typing differs whole module structure needed given local computation present duck type system satisfied type identity analysis
On hand structural type system would require analysis whole module structure compile time determine type identity type dependence
Duck typing differs number aspect
The prominent one duck typing type information determined runtime contrasted compile time name type irrelevant determine type identity type dependence partial structure information required given point program execution
Duck typing us premise referring value walk like duck quack like duck duck reference attributed
The term may coined message see
While one controlled experiment showed increase developer productivity duck typing single developer project controlled experiment API usability show opposite
Many type system created specialized use certain environment certain type data
Frequently based idea formal available part prototype research system
based idea using scalar value precisely describe type value
For example might type matrix
We define typing rule following rule matrix multiplication arbitrary positive integer value
A variant called created based type system type checking conventional dependent type program using without kind limit
Dependent ML limit sort equality decide
Other language make value expression language decidable type checking decidable
However general many program require annotation may
As impedes development process many language implementation provide easy way form option disable condition
This however come cost making run fed program causing compilation fail
based theory closely related type assigned value property one one reference time
These valuable describing large file string operation simultaneously destroys linear object creates similar object optimized hood mutation
Normally possible mutation could cause side effect part program holding reference object violating
They also used prototype operating system interprocess communication statically ensuring process share object shared memory order prevent race condition
The language language us type system order gain lot speed compared performing deep copy remaining safe
type describing value belong two given type overlapping value set
For example implementation C signed char range unsigned char range intersection type two type would range
Such intersection type could safely passed function expecting signed unsigned char compatible type
Intersection type useful describing overloaded function type For example type function taking integer argument returning integer type function taking float argument returning float intersection two type used describe function one based type input given
Such function could passed another function expecting function safely simply would use functionality
In subclassing hierarchy intersection type ancestor type parent derived type
The intersection sibling type empty
The Forsythe language includes general implementation intersection type
A restricted form
type describing value belong two type
For example C signed char range unsigned char range union two type would overall virtual range may used partially depending union member accessed
Any function handling union type would deal integer complete range
More generally valid operation union type operation valid type unioned
C union concept similar union type typesafe permit operation valid type rather
Union type important program analysis used represent symbolic value whose exact nature value type known
In subclassing hierarchy union type ancestor type parent ancestor type
The union sibling type subtype common ancestor operation permitted common ancestor permitted union type may also valid operation common
type frequently used connection represent due ability separate implementation interface
For example type T X f X int describes module interface data member named type function named take parameter type return integer
This could implemented different way example These type subtypes general existential type T correspond concrete implementation type value one type value type Given value type T know regardless abstract type
This give flexibility choosing type suited particular implementation client use value interface existential isolated choice
In general impossible typechecker infer existential type given module belongs
In example intT int f int int could also type X f int int
The simplest solution annotate every module intended type
Although abstract data type module implemented programming language quite time established formal theory slogan Abstract data type existential type
The theory similar existential instead universal quantification
type system variable may typed either static typing dynamic typing allowing software developer choose either type paradigm appropriate within single language
In particular gradual typing us special type named represent type gradual typing replaces notion type equality new relation called relates dynamic type every type
The consistency relation symmetric transitive
Many static type system C Java require The programmer must explicitly associate variable specific type
Others Haskell perform The compiler draw conclusion type variable based programmer use variable
For example given function add together compiler infer must number since addition defined number
Thus call elsewhere program specifies type string list argument would signal error
Numerical string constant expression code often imply type particular context
For example expression might imply type might imply list integer typically
Type inference general possible type theory question
Moreover even inference undecidable general given type theory inference often possible large subset program
Haskell type system version restriction polymorphic type type inference decidable
Most Haskell compiler allow polymorphism extension make type inference undecidable
Type checking decidable however program still type inference higher rank polymorphic program rejected unless given explicit type annotation
Some language like unified type system
This mean type including primitive type inherit single root object
Every type inherits Object class
several primitive type object
Java provides wrapper object type exist together primitive type developer use either wrapper object type simpler primitive type
A statically typed language must verify type consistent type expected context expression appears
For example form inferred type expression must consistent declared inferred type variable
This notion consistency called specific programming language
If type type assignment allowed type valid expression
Thus simplest type system question whether two type compatible reduces whether
Different language however different criterion two type expression understood denote type
These different type vary widely two extreme case two type describe value structure equivalent two syntactically distinct type expression denote type type must name order equal
In language compatibility relation complex
In particular subtype value type used context one type expected even reverse true
Like equivalence subtype relation defined differently programming language many variation possible
The presence parametric ad hoc language may also implication type compatibility

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A programming language one type integer character hexadecimal packed decimal forth predefined part programming language constant variable defined given program must described one data type
Certain operation may allowable certain data type
The language enforces data typing use compliance
An advantage strong data typing imposes rigorous set rule programmer thus guarantee certain consistency result
A disadvantage prevents programmer inventing data type anticipated developer programming language limit creative one using given data type

The equal method C change paramater covariant way match equal method I
At first I thought professor forgot add Implements I answer also stated following Answers refereed fact C implement I accepted given Structurally Typed language matter subtype
I sure I understand refer method covariant contravariant relation subtyping C I
Can anyone clear
Structurally typed mean need write type method compatible signature automatically subtype
However case implement due variance subtype
EDIT I explain For C structurally equivalent I need know type hierarchy argument equal
Yes recursive structural type complicate issue quite bit
The equal method C change paramater covariant way match equal method I
This strictly speaking incorrect covariant since subtype
It instead say
assume subtype equal method change parameter covariant way get contradiction
You could claim treated
subtypes contradiction
Another problem definition depends recursive structural type complicate language quite bit

In said feature specifies one restriction operation involving value different intermixed
The opposite strong typing
Most generally strong typing implies place severe restriction intermixing permitted occur preventing running us data considered invalid way
For instance operation may allow add value operates upon may used upon number
However nature strength restriction highly variable
Some factor writer qualified strong typing include Note definition contradictory others merely orthogonal still others special case additional constraint liberal le strong definition
Because wide divergence among definition possible defend claim programming language either strongly weakly typed
For instance For reason writer wish write unambiguously type system often eschew term strong typing favor specific expression type safety

Also one imply
What difference strongly typed language statically typed language
A statically typed language type system checked compile time implementation compiler interpreter
The type check reject program program pas check usually come guarantee example compiler guarantee use integer arithmetic instruction number
There real agreement strongly typed mean although widely used definition professional literature strongly typed language possible programmer work around restriction imposed type system
This term almost always used describe statically typed language
The opposite statically typed dynamically typed mean For example dynamically typed language string type number type Boolean type among others
In Lua every value belongs one type requirement dynamically typed language
In Lua permissible concatenate two string permissible concatenate string Boolean
The opposite strongly typed weakly typed mean work around type system
C notoriously weakly typed pointer type convertible pointer type simply casting
Pascal intended strongly typed oversight design untagged variant record introduced loophole type system technically weakly typed
Examples truly strongly typed language include CLU Standard ML Haskell
Standard ML fact undergone several revision remove loophole type system discovered language widely deployed
Overall turn useful talk strong weak
Whether type system loophole le important exact number nature loophole likely come practice consequence exploiting loophole
In practice Amateurs often conflate static dynamic
Apparently weak typing used person talk relative prevalance absence implicit conversion
Professionals ca agree exactly term mean
Overall unlikely inform enlighten audience
The sad truth come type system If want discus relative strength type system better discus exactly guarantee provided
For example good question ask every value given type class guaranteed created calling one type constructor
In C answer
In CLU F Haskell yes
For I would like know
By contrast mean program program might rejected start
mean type checked execution poorly typed operation might cause program halt otherwise signal error run time
A primary reason static typing rule program might dynamic type error
Does one imply
On pedantic level word strong really mean anything
But practice people almost always one two thing They incorrectly use strong weak mean static dynamic case incorrectly using strongly typed statically typed interchangeably
They use strong weak compare property static type system
It rare hear someone talk strong weak dynamic type system
Except FORTH really sort type system I ca think dynamically typed language type system subverted
Sort definition check bulit execution engine every operation get checked sanity executed
Either way person call language strongly typed person likely talking statically typed language
This often misunderstood let clear
type bound
Types checked compile time
type bound
Types checked run time
So Java example forever
During life may point different since reference Java
It may value never refer
That static typing
In PHP That dynamic typing
Edit alert
phrase widely agreed upon meaning
Most programmer use term mean something static typing use imply type discipline enforced compiler
For example CLU strong type system allow client code create value abstract type except using constructor provided type
C somewhat strong type system subverted degree program always cast value one pointer type value another pointer type
So example C take value returned cheerfully cast compiler wo try stop even warn anything dodgy
The original answer said something value changing type run time
I known many language designer compiler writer known one talked value changing type run time except possibly advanced research type system known strong update problem
implies compiler enforce typing discpline perhaps enforcement easily subverted
The original answer conflated weak typing sometimes also called implicit promotion
For example Java This code example implicit promotion implicitly converted string concatenated
It argued Java compiler rewrite code Consider classic PHP start problem The error return index match
coerced boolean thus condition actually true
The solution use instead avoid implicit conversion
This example illustrates combination implicit conversion dynamic typing lead programmer astray
Compare Ruby runtime error Ruby implicitly converted happens passed method
In Ruby programmer must make conversion explicit Comparing PHP Ruby good illustration
Both dynamically typed language PHP lot implicit conversion Ruby perhaps surprisingly unfamiliar
The point axis independent axis
People confuse probably part strong v weak typing le clearly defined real consensus exactly meant strong weak
For reason typing far shade grey rather black white
So answer question another way look correct say static typing type safety strong typing runtime type safety
The reason variable statically typed language type must declared checked compile time
A language value type run time difficult programmer subvert type system without dynamic check
But important understand language
Strongly typed mean restriction conversion type
Statically typed mean type dynamic change type variable created
Data Coercion necessarily mean weakly typed sometimes syntacical sugar The example Java weakly typed Is weakly typed example really Data coercion also weakly typed constructing new object
Java bad example weakly typed language good reflection likely weakly typed
Because runtime language always know type exception might native type
This unlike C one best example weakly typed
The runtime idea byte integer struct pointer character
EDIT Both pole two different axis mean automatically converted one type another
Weakly typed opposite Perl use string like numeric context automatically converting int
A strongly typed language like python
mean compiler figure type variable compile time
Dynamically typed language figure type variable runtime
Strong typing probably mean variable type strict rule combining variable different type expression
For example A integer B float strict rule might A cast float result returned float
If A integer B string strict rule might valid
Static typing probably mean type assigned compile time equivalent language change program execution
Note classification mutually exclusive indeed I would expect occur together frequently
Many language also
And note I use word universally accepted definition term
As already seen answer far
One imply
For language typed mean type variable known inferred compile time
A typed language allow use one type another
C weakly typed language good example strongly typed language allow
In C pas data element wrong type complain
In strongly typed language
In computer programming programming language often colloquially referred strongly typed weakly typed
These term precise definition general strongly typed language likely generate error refuse compile argument passed function closely match expected type
On hand weakly typed language may produce unpredictable result may perform implicit type conversion By posting answer agree

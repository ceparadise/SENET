Advantages Disadvantages Analysis Applications Spreadsheets Database Word Processing Email Conclusion The Paperless society
Introduction Paperless Society Conclusion Appendices Bibliography References Computer Solutions Introduction The following report look three main area first area demonstrate understanding regarding advantage disadvantage Transaction Processing
The second section look advantage disadvantage business context discussing application Spreadsheets Database Word processing would best used expand strength weakness area
The finally part three research provide evidence regarding society live today achieved Society
It discus look toward providing evidence backup discredit hypothesis method using different form research
Transaction Processing What transaction processing
Transaction processing involves round trip transfer financial transaction data example consumer credit card information merchant web site processing network VeriSign thereafter completes transfer fund merchant
From quotation established processing electronic form processing data
This format financial transaction simply processing order via electronic format purchase via Web
Advantages The advantage system ease quickness used
For example automated transaction process ATM machine whole wall banking
Through service customer able withdraw deposit money check account detail order stationary cheque book statement etc
This available time convenient customer accessible hour day meaning customer conduct Middle Other facility also available within package mail merge
This benefit company data merged program order produce thing mailing label envelope standard form letter etc
The advantage time saved repetitive job quick easy relatively error free
Large volume letter etc produced short time
Through inclusion spelling grammar check facility document checked error quickly make work dispatched company become professional
The find replace function able locate specified would within document replace another required
This save time go multi paged document reading word word order find error change
The program automatically change word second check user word located fact want changing
There many feature within program make viable business older form typing ability change font style size address appearance new version Microsoft Word used effective desk top publishing package
The main disadvantage computer shuts program performs illegal operation work saved document could lost
Another disadvantage word processing program compatible would mean work produced specific software would edited one compatible version
Training cost could also become expensive order staff able operate specific processing package retraining new version word Conclusion Paper consumption increase around world especially developing Asian country
World consumption metric ton according FAO Food Agriculture Organisation United Nations
The second annual National Filing Survey found per cent respondent believe paperless office unachievable even working towards believe either
Conclusion Although fact lead u believe reaching goal society documented evidence case found
On research carried seam disprove hypothesis Paperless society
From finding seen evidence show paper used today previously possible different format
reduced preparation time cost sending correspondence evidence show recipient still print lot information
This could fully trusting technology yet even finding easier read hard copy format one fully know sure research concluded done study Richard Harper Abigail Sellen
Therefore research concluded still long way society possible never one
When I hear term paperless office I control laughter
Why
Because thing paperless office
And unfortunately likely become reality anytime soon
Scott Nesbitt latest technology allow u work digital world depend paper heavily
Indeed workplace dependent paper
It seems promised paperless office much mythical ideal today thirty year ago

information processing divided individual indivisible operation called
Each transaction must succeed complete unit never partially complete
For example purchase book online bookstore exchange money form credit book
If credit good series related operation ensures get book bookstore get money
However single operation series fails exchange entire exchange fails
You get book bookstore get money
The technology responsible making exchange balanced predictable called transaction processing
Transactions ensure resource permanently updated unless operation within transactional unit complete successfully
By combining set related operation unit either completely succeeds completely fails one simplify error recovery make one application reliable
Transaction processing system consist computer hardware software hosting application performs routine transaction necessary conduct business
Examples include system manage sale order entry airline reservation payroll employee record manufacturing shipping
Since though necessarily transaction processing today interactive term often treated synonymous
Transaction processing designed maintain system Integrity typically modern known consistent state ensuring interdependent operation system either completed successfully canceled successfully
For example consider typical banking transaction involves moving customer saving account customer checking account
This transaction involves least two separate operation computer term debiting saving account crediting checking account
If one operation succeeds book bank balance end day
There must therefore way ensure either operation succeed fail never inconsistency bank database whole
Transaction processing link multiple individual operation single indivisible transaction ensures either operation transaction completed without error none
If operation completed error occur others attempted system roll back operation transaction including successful one thereby erasing trace transaction restoring system consistent known state processing transaction began
If operation transaction completed successfully transaction system change database made permanent transaction rolled back done
Transaction processing guard hardware software error might leave transaction partially completed
If computer system crash middle transaction transaction processing system guarantee operation uncommitted transaction cancelled
Generally transaction issued concurrently
If overlap
need touch portion database create conflict
For example customer mentioned example saving account attempt transfer different person time moving checking account one succeed
However forcing transaction processed sequentially inefficient
Therefore concurrent implementation transaction processing programmed guarantee end result reflects outcome could reached executing transaction sequentially order property called
In example mean matter transaction issued first either transfer different person move checking account succeeds one fails
The basic principle system
However terminology may vary one system another term used necessarily universal
system ensure database integrity recording intermediate state database modified using record restore database known state transaction committed
For example copy information database modification transaction set aside system transaction make modification sometimes called
If part transaction fails committed copy used restore database state transaction began
It also possible keep separate modification database management system
sometimes called
This required rollback failed transaction useful updating database management system event database failure system provide
If database management system fails entirely must restored recent
The reflect transaction committed since made
However database management system restored journal image applied database bring database management system date
Any transaction progress time failure rolled back
The result database consistent known state includes result transaction committed moment failure
In case two transaction may course processing attempt access portion database time way prevents proceeding
For example transaction A may access portion X database transaction B may access portion Y database
If point transaction A try access portion Y database transaction B try access portion X occurs neither transaction move forward
system designed detect deadlock occur
Typically transaction cancelled rolled back started different order automatically deadlock occur
Or sometimes one deadlocked transaction cancelled rolled back automatically restarted short delay
Deadlocks also occur among three transaction
The transaction involved difficult detect point transaction processing system find practical limit deadlock detect
In system commit rollback mechanism available undesirable often used undo failed transaction restore system previous state
defined property reliable transaction system late acronym atomicity consistency isolation durability
A transaction change state atomic either happen none happen
These change include database change message action transducer
A transaction correct transformation state
The action taken group violate integrity constraint associated state
Even though transaction execute concurrently appears transaction T others executed either T T
Once transaction completes successfully commits change database survive failure retain change Transaction processing benefit Standard first developed often closely coupled particular
implemented similar principle mixed success
However recent year distributed model become considerably difficult maintain
As number transaction grew response various online service especially single distributed database practical solution
In addition online system consist whole suite program operating together opposed strict model single server could handle transaction processing
Today number transaction processing system available work level scale large system including
One effort DTP see also JTA
However proprietary environment IBM still popular although CICS evolved include open industry standard well
The term used describe transaction processing system uncommonly challenging requirement particularly throughput requirement transaction per second
Such system may implemented via distributed cluster style architecture

Older child relationship continue evolve time hopefully reach level peer relationship
There ideal norm relationship later life
The nature quality older child relationship dyad influenced factor including family history culture prior degree emotional closeness power distribution within relationship evolved time role strain competing demand experienced either member relationship
Family study individual development theorist researcher examined relationship term reciprocity exchange degree attachment connectedness intimacy filial responsibility obligation altruism family solidarity social norm
In fact many older parent adult child experience ambivalence mixed emotion recognizing positive negative aspect evolving relationship
Should physical emotional frailty illness older parent occur relationship often transition caregiving older parent becomes recipient care adult child play central role decision making parent family need activity
Each adult child family negotiates navigates evolution relationship aging parent changing relationship also affect nature quality relationship sibling
When multiple adult child may significant tension option considered decision made regarding aging future often reminiscent pattern interaction earlier point family life cycle
The degree family open discussing aging eventuality death important influence whether aging parent adult child able plan future term providing instrumental assistance organizing finance making decision living situation care health care need advance directive
Although becoming grandparent typically occurs late midlife transition grandparenthood often marker shift role power within family system older generation family system relinquishes direct responsibility rearing launching child next younger generation
The contribution role grandparent within family system vary significantly across ethnic group influenced geographic location generation family well age health status economic resource older generation
Such contribution may include becoming responsible drawing family together preserving history extra pair hand care grandchild provider advice dispenser wisdom family experience stress sharing financial resource assist younger generation cost housing education
Relationships grandchild often important component life older adult providing continuity responsibility within family supporting meaning
Divorce remarriage adult child profound impact older adult value role grandparent
Maternal grandparent often called upon assist child care newly single mother
This especially case one grandchild chronic illness mental health cognitive problem physical disability
In addition providing emotional support grandparent may provide financial assistance place daughter grandchild live
In blended family remarriage adult child must redefine negotiate role relationship grandchild newly added
In family acrimonious outcome following divorce contact grandchild may limited grandparent lose role valued significantly significant impact mental physical health grandparent
Almost grandparent United States responsible raising grandchild result substance abuse incarceration illness disability death adult child
When grandparent take nonnormative expanded role positive negative consequence member family social economic legal level
Many household considered fragile social service educational professional low income limited access health care service physical emotional problem grandchild
The needed assume parenting role requires grandparent redefine expectation later year often perceived interruption developmental path
change affect physical function making activity associated managing household caring young child challenging although many grandparent caregiver take pride role
The prevalence depression anxiety borderline health status higher among grandparent raising grandchild among older adult assume role
If grandparent caregiver requires hospitalization rehabilitation care may resource assist child care daily task many family rely church group nonprofit agency formal social service keep family functioning stressor occur

Consistent classic theory homophily value similarity important predictor relationship quality parent adult child
In fact found among strongest consistent predictor wide range dimension child relation including closeness conflict ambivalence preference confiding caregiving
Further longitudinal research change parental differentiation later year demonstrated value similarity best predictor offspring remain close mother across time well offspring become close time
It surprising homophily value importance tie theory child development propose primary goal parental socialization imbuing value mother father believe necessary
Because parent typically attempt socialize child hold value hold closeness would expected greater among dyad high value consensus
Regardless whether living completed important patient assign durable power attorney
If patient made assignment law country Canada certain area United States outline hierarchy substitute decision maker patient incapacitated
Typically start spouse proceeds adult child parent sibling finally distant relative
If several family member priority decision may made consensus majority choosing one member responsible making decision behalf group
Although procedure intended reflect typical order priority would assigned patient first person legally assigned hierarchy list may necessarily one patient would chosen may may share similar viewpoint value
It also possible situation assigned power attorney critically ill patient lack capacity attending physician make decision whether limit life support
Whether assigned patient substitute decision maker family member often inaccurately predict patient wish true patient physician
In recent study Hauser colleague interviewed patient caregiver cancer assessed concordance preference care
The proportion concordant response ranged patient likely express concern domain might impose caregiver caregiver likely express concern patient physical suffering
Thus important emphasize patient need explicitly discus treatment preference family member well physician
Once power attorney chosen useful patient power attorney meet patient oncologist discus patient wish care
A range topic addressed depending willing patient engage process
At minimum patient asked identify person person speak behalf becomes necessary
It important inform patient state law legal hierarchy surrogate absence durable power attorney
Typically hierarchy follows although verified state law guardian durable power attorney health care spouse adult child parent adult sibling
These hierarchy law may cause problem patient particularly large family nontraditional family relationship partner
For example many patient know state law require consensus among multiple person category adult child must agree estranged spouse still legal authority others make surrogate decision
These patient encouraged complete durable power attorney health care give surrogate legal standing preferred legal decision maker
Most patient willing identify surrogate
Although cognitively impaired individual may able make decision treatment may still capable identifying person would prefer make decision behalf
provides set criterion evaluating would best candidate act surrogate
After surrogate identified may best end first advance care planning conversation encouraging patient surrogate attend next visit discus preference goal care
When surrogate present helpful restate goal advance care planning discussion role surrogate decision maker including reminder surrogate authority decision maker take effect patient becomes decisionally incapacitated
The clinician review known patient wish give patient opportunity expand preference goal care
list question clinician use discus patient preference goal care
Topics explore include gaining understanding patient family value belief respect make life worth living
Sometimes topic explored discussion undesirable outcome situation patient would prefer death continued existence life support
Patients frequently identify persistent vegetative state condition worse If mention state important explore consider unacceptable especially patient frequently end situation exactly match conceptualization
The term mean many different thing different people
Therefore important patient define term
In addition patient strong feeling Again important explore source feeling frequently based misunderstanding treatment entail know option therapeutic trial stopped short time
Discussions specific treatment always framed around goal care treatment used reach desired outcome outcome
The patient surrogate discus degree interpretive leeway exercised adhering patient previously expressed preference
Research documented many patient comfortable allowing surrogate leeway decision making
Additionally although autonomy major principle guide advance care planning patient still retain capacity prefer defer judgment surrogate acknowledge best outcome may one always maximize personal autonomy
One reason patient defer decision making allow surrogate leeway interpreting preference avoid burdening loved one recognize family member able need interest
It important determine whether surrogate comfortable plan discus anticipated difficulty discomfort making decision withdraw life support fundamental difference value definition acceptable quality life
Surrogates often need support coming term loved one illness impending death
Sometimes difference value reflect surrogate difficulty letting go may signal need help anticipatory grief feeling overwhelmed responsibility making decision
It helpful reassure surrogate clinical team responsible making treatment recommendation treatment decision withdrawal life support
The surrogate role represent patient value preference respect goal care
This help relieve surrogate feeling responsibility causing patient death example decision withholding withdrawing treatment need made
For patient chronic illness whose trajectory decline somewhat predictable useful discus contingency plan patient family may respond acute exacerbation sudden change health status
Patients family report prepared next step illness journey highly valued
Knowing call go emergency help patient family manage uncertainty illness dying
Some author advocate discussing prognosis patient part advance care planning especially patient may die next month
The benefit discussing prognosis patient willing help family prioritize would like spend remaining time
In addition patient preference treatment may shaped understanding prognosis
For example patient optimistic survival likely choose aggressive therapy even therapy care provider consider futile
In contrast patient acknowledge shorter life expectancy likely accept hospice referral shift goal palliative care
Transitions denote change change often physical psychological nature
Normative life transition starting school first child complex event involve multiple people well altered environment
The focus entering preschool parent principal player clearly one
In case new preschooler member family part play school teacher staff
Similarly parent newborn becoming grandparent perhaps first time another transition interest
Being parent also implication work life parent thus supervisor supervised part transition
Furthermore multiple individual involved transition also multiple biological behavioral contextual change focus individual
The preschooler may need wake earlier dress differently give watching favorite television program learn share toy follow direction sleep different place forth
Accommodations required new parent include biological change interrupted sleep behavioral change
learning change diaper feed infant contextual change
outfitting nursery sharing bedroom even bed infant
Some transition transition adulthood far complex multidimensional others
Although new preschooler spends part time different environment new role entail either new family new home whereas moving adulthood involves multiple transition multiple dimension fairly long period time different dimension coming different time
There general agreement pp
five major change occur individual transition childhood adulthood school completion employment residence independent parent marriage union parenthood
These transition occur different time different order many people
For example completed high school according highly unlikely ever married age
They also almost still living parent living separate household
A minority
However next year number change dramatically
In age group employed married
Clearly age range come called emerging adulthood multiple transition multiple dimension multiple time take place typical individual industrialized society United States Canada Western Europe well country Organization Economic Development
Moreover The New York Times headlined Long Road Adulthood Growing Even Cohen JuneÂ transition occurring substantially later age decade earlier men woman
This launching delay implication child relationship
noted although parent necessarily dissatisfied typically developing child level satisfaction lower adult child unemployed financially dependent
Furthermore reported improvement child relation child moved away
If transition adulthood involve person intellectual developmental disability IDD complexity magnified duration likely longer young adult without disability
Indeed transition may never successfully achieved least according criterion apply typically developing individual
Multiple study find adult IDD continue live parent well adulthood
This continuing postponed launching involves many factor related family community
list contributing influence combination personal parental motivation well lack desirable community alternative responsible delayed launching
The transition school work also delayed person IDD
In contrast variability transition regard place residence adult IDD move school life United States written law occurs latest student reach birthday longer eligible free appropriate educational service
Although country legislation regarding educational entitlement person IDD national scope transition still take place point late adolescence year thereafter
For example Australia state regulation regard education beyond age compulsory schooling end
Typically extension educational service year granted Monica Cuskelly personal communication
Regardless variation state policy young adult IDD transition school replace work reported unemployment rate reach range depending age intellectual disability category
This transition something nothing le desirable alternative schooling major concern parent well professional involved service delivery adult IDD
In addition transition involving employment residence young adult typically engaged personal interpersonal developmental change involve solidified identity establishment intimacy significant beginning nuclear family
Together satisfaction work personal life result period generativity important leading ultimate integrity adult life
For many adult IDD especially severely impaired functioning intimacy family might follow elusive
Persons IDD far le likely marry child typical peer
Furthermore become parent child risk variety negative behavioral cognitive outcome although provision support minimize risk
Nonetheless adult IDD historically discouraged child public policy forced sterilization removal child home actualized discouragement
Instead adult IDD likely remain attached involved reliant family middle adulthood even old age
This continued closeness clearly consequence family origin
In chapter review research including transition particular emphasis parental reaction
We two main purpose emphasis What range parental reaction extent characterized worry reward
We believe model pathology often used describe study family rearing child IDD replaced framework encompasses distress resilience
Historically period transition adulthood viewed reawakening hoped perfect parent needed adjust new adult reality
An early harbinger reality often failure student earn high school diploma
For example presented three case study family high school student mild IDD failed newly introduced state competency exam student pas earn diploma
In case failure student parent reaction failure appeared precipitate family crisis
What evidence exists period transition adulthood generally crisis parent
What factor contribute success various transition predicted individual family child characteristic measured earlier time concurrently
Although recognize variable culture national economic condition differing world view play important role address directly project designed able study variable inextricably linked national culture policy well time period
Nonetheless acknowledge critical investigator
Precision medicine part larger personalized medicine movement also known medicine predictive preventative personalized participatory

The effect psychotropic drug seldom determined solely pharmacological property discussed
Indeed psychotropic medication prescribed used within transactional system child family physician clinician well others teacher peer significant life child
Of course must remember child rarely ever seek assistance physician directly parent caretaker almost always without asking input child
The child view treatment process therapeutic alliance child attribution effect medication also important may responsible least effect pharmacotherapy
Further factor compliance placebo effect sociocultural ecobehavioral factor important treatment outcome
However majority study child psychopharmacology focused biological variable pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics pharmacogenetics exclusion virtually others
There large number contextual variable may contribute outcome psychopharmacotherapy
While variable covered present diverse example show assessment treatment outcome much complex hitherto noted psychopharmacological research
Girls age always cautioned potential interaction pregnancy nursing course psychiatric disorder psychotropic treatment
With drug lithium valproic acid real possibility drug change simpl pregnancy interaction increase risk malformation unborn child potential later developmental anomaly
For example lithium may increase risk fetal macrosomia premature delivery perinatal mortality teratogenic effect valproic acid exposed fetus includes incidence spina bifida Behavioral toxicity refers undesirable effect essentially therapeutic level medication clinically indicated given disorder
These undesirable effect may include anticholinergic effect blockade dopaminergic effect among others
In behavioral term behavioral toxicity classified concurrent stimulus event affect ongoing interaction child
For example take case child medication seizure disorder
The drowsiness produced anticonvulsant medication phenobarbital may cause function poorly might absence
Thus case behavioral toxicity may operate concurrently classroom instruction activity home
In assessing effect psychopharmacotherapy clinician include measure behavioral toxicity assist child treatment team arrive treatment decision basis data
Compliance degree child adheres recommended treatment plan treating physician
In child compliance medication typically partial tend take medication irregularly le often prescribed
The reason medication noncompliance categorized capricious absolute refusal confusion
Often noncompliance occurs unpleasant side effect medication perceived stigma associated taking medication school
Some child believe taking medication somehow lessens control life medication determines
Medication compliance child increased child actively participate treatment planning ii explaining child treatment begin expected side effect medication iii emphasizing positive aspect taking medication prescribed iv simplest drug regimen taking medication day drug
Further compliance increased involving family treatment process
Clearly psychosocial factor associated medication compliance affect outcome treatment
Comorbidity presence disorder one targeted treatment affect treatment outcome additional disorder change simple drug disorder environment interaction complex drug disorder environment disorder interaction one comorbid disorder
This interaction may mean second treatment could pharmacotherapy alternative necessary control comorbid disorder resulting drug disorder environment drug disorder interaction
Of course interaction may also occur drug drug interaction change physiologically determined susceptibility drug interact environment produce certain unintended positive adverse effect side effect
This scenario suggests child must adequately assessed target symptom syndrome disorder also comorbid disorder
Further interactive effect treatment environment disorder must assessed clinical treatment baseline placebo treatment research protocol
This critical consideration many childhood disorder
For example comorbid axis I psychiatric disorder commonly associated childhood depression ADHD
The clinical import variable comorbidity may contribute differential response psychopharmacologic treatment
The placebo effect pharmacology phenomenon observed child exhibit clinically significant response physiologically inert substance
This rare phenomenon may account therapeutic response observed psychopharmacologic treatment
The placebo response due psychopharmacological property drug outcome due effect prescribed intervention
It result purely psychological effect consequence expectancy outcome treatment
While majority placebo effect established simply asking child feeling better child complete rating scale provides measure subjective often placebo effect also measured objectively
For example individual given placebo treatment anxiety disorder often show le autonomic nervous system arousal decrease heart rate lower blood pressure
Although evidence sustained placebo response adult child relapse fairly rapidly suggesting continued monitoring placebo response absolutely necessary population
In behavioral term reciprocal interaction concurrent context set occasion interaction
This important variable affect course psychopharmacotherapy initial effect drug child may also effect reaction others interact
This phenomenon clearly illustrated stimulant treatment child ADHD drug increased child compliance parent demand ii parent turn reduced command disciplinary behavior increasing positive interaction child
This highlight importance assessing drug effect reciprocal interaction child significant others environment parent sibling peer teacher
Although selectively discussed factor affect outcome psychopharmacologic treatment many factor monitored impact outcome pharmacologic intervention
During first CRAFT session CSOs given time describe problem created substance use associated distress
Next goal procedure outlined expected role CSOs highlighted
Finally effort instill positive expectation change overview scientific support CRAFT presented
This includes summary success engaging IPs treatment enhancing functioning overview type individual relationship responded well IPs various drug choice relationship included spouse parent adult child etc
CRAFT us variation CRA Functional Analysis substance using behavior CSOs completing form IPs
Recognizing trigger consequence necessary formulate point influence CSOs using behavior
Assume example sister CSO completing functional analysis brother IP report positive consequence column brother like smoking marijuana stressful workday help relax
The clinician would inquire way IP relaxed work past would see whether CSO could play part increasing likelihood brother would choose healthier method smoking
At time care would taken make sure CSO understands although objective influence behavior ultimately control culpable negative outcome resulting substance use decision
CSOs taught change behavior toward IP time substance use behavior change intended experienced IPs unpleasant
Given already strong correlation substance use domestic violence critical ass potential violence determining behavior change part CSO safe introduce
Domestic violence exclusionary factor original CRAFT study therapist also must decide whether safe CSOs receive CRAFT treatment
If deemed reasonable proceed functional analysis IP aggression may help illustrate trigger IP violence offer insight maintenance
Relevant CRA procedure may woven CRAFT well positive communication develop necessary prevention protection plan
Communication skill training critical component CRAFT since communication style commonly swing aggressiveness silence
The training follows procedure introduced CRA exception taught skill instead substance abusing client
Learning communicate positive manner lay foundation CRAFT procedure
For instance positive communication essential minimizing IP defensiveness time CSOs explain change behavior toward IP withdrawal reward time CSOs ready invite IP sample treatment
Assume CSO wife rehearses conversation hope IP husband sit dinner evening
With much practice feedback session CSO arrives I know unhappy job day like unwind friend work stopping drink
And I guess help stress level I immediately start going long list financial problem soon walk door night I could best stop
I know come straight home like eat earlier
I could move dinner min
What think The CSO would conversation repeatedly decided approach husband
Furthermore would discussed might react IP responded negatively
CRAFT built upon principle positive reinforcement namely people likely repeat behavior rewarded
CSOs taught systematically reward behavior
Since many CSOs mistake positive reinforcement therapist explains enabling inadvertently make easier behavior continue whereas positive reinforcement paired exclusively behavior
Once principle understood CSOs assisted identifying several small inexpensive reward introduced
Popular example include watching favorite TV show making special dessert giving compliment hug
Details regarding reward delivered addressed conversation IP reward delivered practiced
An example polished conversation positive reinforcement husband CSO might prepare wife IP go antique mall like much little window shopping dinner
I see using today I love spending time stayed away The counterpart rewarding nonusing IP behavior withdraw reward substance use occurs
This positive reinforcement relatively reward question one newly introduced one
For instance CSO started watch one favorite TV program evening smoke marijuana would elect sit watch show smoked day
She would use positive communication skill convey look like tonight going good night u watch TV together I tell smoking
It really fun spending time evening high
try The therapist help CSO identify additional reasonable reward withdraw time IP substance use well always exploring potential violent IP reaction adjusting accordingly
The second manner negative consequence introduced drinking drug use allowing consequence substance use occur
Assume mother CSO typically care adult child IP whenever hangover calling sick
In probability CSO would asked consider letting deal consequence nobody contacting workplace time next hangover
Certainly negative ramification changing normal behavior situation would discussed length since CSO IP safety paramount importance
In majority case CSOs elect inform IP advance change behavior take place drinking drug use resume
The Happiness Scale Goals Counseling form borrowed CRA help CSOs target different area life would like make change
Since social isolation quite common CSOs category Happiness Scale often focus
For example goal CSO might reconnect old friend take class Continuing Education effort sample new recreational activity
Potential problematic reaction IPs always discussed advance
The procedure described thus far set stage treatment engagement occur well address goal final piece entail helping CSOs determine invite IP enter treatment
To articulate request positive communication skill put play motivational added stress incentive
For example IP struggling find job CSO might say know trying really hard find work
The agency going therapy counselor help people lot thing including finding job
What think giving try Reluctant IPs might also encouraged treatment session two without making commitment
Another motivational hook idea IPs therapist see therapist
Regarding ideal time extend invitation CSOs taught look opportunity occasion representing greater likelihood IP agree treatment
One common example IP start asking question happens therapy
CSOs prepped respond come session find
love introduce A somewhat different case IP unaware fact CSO therapy asks CSO acting differently toward IP lately
CSO using positive communication reward
The CSO might respond therapy work relationship
ups down know
How would feel joining session two
It would mean lot Although many IPs agree treatment point CRAFT program CSOs must prepared possibility IP still refuse least temporarily
If occurs CSO encouraged continue various CRAFT procedure
Given IPs agree attend treatment eventually necessary arrangement therapist available IP get placed waiting list
Ideally therapist behavioral complement CRAFT approach

How think interaction could analyzed
In transactional analysis theory interaction would analyzed looking transaction take place
Eric Berne developed theory defined fundamental unit social interaction
This created basic unit could studied measured classified
According Berne observe people say people resulting effect individual act
In lesson looking transaction take place interpersonal intrapersonal basis examine interpreted
Let begin intrapersonal transaction
interaction person mind
When tell something smile way look mirror intrapersonal transaction
On hand interaction take place two individual
When stranger smile street mother call ask heard interpersonal transaction
In order understand transaction first need talk Berne concept ego state
According Berne consistent pattern feeling experience directly related corresponding consistent pattern behavior
Berne defined confirmed observable behavior parent adult child
The ego state contains external event imposed people first five year life
These construct imposed child
Examples would talk stranger hold hand cross street touch hot stove
The ego state contains feeling emotion related external event imposed person first five year life
These feeling emotion replayed person mind corresponding external event recalled
Examples would approached strange person make feel nervous feel safe I hold someone hand scared burned
The last ego state
The adult ego state evaluates really going make independent decision world
This ego state begin forming soon gain ability control aspect environment
It allows person compare told world feel experience
Let use hot stove example
The adult told parent touch hot stove recognizes child fear burned reasonable
Therefore adult determines use caution necessary use hot stove
Thomas Harris us extremely simplified way explain ego state
The parent child adult
Any time person intrapersonal interpersonal transaction involves communication ego state
A message sent response expected
Berne defined complementary crossed ulterior

What person told prank thought would mean expecting laugh
Rather response coming child response parent telling child wrong
complex transaction involves two ego state disguised message sent
These transaction get complicated use simple one example
When tell person idea play prank someone else work also ask help
The real reason come prank idea excuse talk person
Your adult logical conversation person adult goal playing prank real goal child desire person
We learned according transactional analysis theory lot different factor play role personal interaction
These interaction fundamental unit social interaction called transaction
When examine transaction must know ego state come parent child adult
We must also consider whether interpersonal intrapersonal type transaction taking place
Three main type transaction complementary crossed ulterior
Once understand basic feature transaction begin better analyze understand interaction well

Creator Transactional Analysis Author Games People Play The following introductory description Transactional Analysis
It designed understood layperson written approximately level complexity Berne used
While many theory purporting explain human behavior frequently cited known work Sigmund Freud
Freud emerged early century theory personality
Freud believed personality three component must work together produce complex behavior
These three component aspect
It Freud belief three component needed produce reasonable mental health stability individual
According Freud Id function part mind Ego function part mind Superego thought part mind manifestation societal parental value
But perhaps Freud greatest contribution one influenced Berne fact human personality Regardless classification name given particular area personality id superego etc
individual posse faction frequently collide
And collision interaction personality faction manifest individual thought feeling behavior
Thus Freud theory individual behavior understood analyzing understanding three faction
But point emphasized later paper Berne belief Freud proposed structure phenomenological reality Another scientist whose contribution impacted Berne development Transactional Analysis neurosurgeon McGill University Montreal
Penfield experiment focused application electrical current specific region brain
Penfield discovered applying current temporal lobe live alert patient would stimulate meaningful memory
In addition vivid picture person past revealed also associated event patient would recite event even though many case event patient unable recollect
Penfield carried similar experiment many year
Some key conclusion reached went influence Berne development Transactional Analysis include The human brain act many way like camcorder vividly recording event
While event may necessarily able consciously retrieved owner event always exists brain
Both stored brain
The event feeling locked together neither one recalled without
When individual replay experience replay vivid form individual experience emotion felt actual experience
Or Berne student said Individuals able exist two state simultaneously
Individuals replaying certain event able experience emotion associated event also able objectively talk event time
These contribution Penfield Freud well many others used Berne developed theory Transactional Analysis game
Before Berne first published theory Transactional Analysis spent year formulating framework approach
The key methodology Berne also defined stroke discussed detail later paper
Many criticism science lack thereof behind psychotherapy fact basic unit study measurement classification
For example study chemistry revolutionized atomic theory John Dalton without atom fundamental unit advancement chemistry science would proceeded slowly
By identifying defining transaction Berne provided psychotherapeutic science atom needed allow rigorous analysis
Although Berne defined transaction long published description transaction easily understood The unit social intercourse called transaction
If two people encounter sooner later one speak give indication acknowledging presence others
This called Another person say something way related stimulus called With definition Berne defined basic unit analysis
At simplest level By identifying standardizing upon single unit development promotion theory easily facilitated
Psychotherapists able read Berne theory test practice
Thomas Harris stated Transactional Analysis found new language It noted approach profoundly different Freud
While Freud psychotherapist took rather simplistic approach asking patient Berne took alternate approach therapy
Berne felt therapist could learn problem simply observing communicated word body language facial expression transaction
So instead directly asking patient question Berne would frequently observe patient group setting noting transaction occurred patient individual
In addition analysis interaction individual Transactional Analysis also involves identification behind every transaction
Berne defined ego state As practicing psychiatrist Carmel California early Berne treated hundred patient
During course treatment consistently noted patient indeed people could would change course conversation
The change would necessarily verbal change could involve facial expression body language body temperature many cue
In one counseling session Berne treated year old lawyer
During session lawyer male said I really lawyer I little But outside confines Berne office patient successful attorney
Later session lawyer would frequently ask Berne talking lawyer little Berne intrigued seeing single individual display two state Berne began referring two state Adult Later Berne identified third state one seemed represent patient observed parent small
Berne referred As Berne turned patient began observe three present
As Berne gained confidence theory went introduce paper one year published seminal paper introducing Transactional Analysis
Berne ultimately defined three ego state
It carefully noted description ego state NOT necessarily correspond common definition used English language
Before describing three ego state important note fundamentally different Freud Ego Id Superego
Berne describes best writes It demonstrated Parent Adult Child concept like Superego Ego Id Jungian construct Stated another way Freud ego state unobservable theoretical state Berne three ego state confirmed observable behavior
The following detailed description three ego state The parent represents massive collection recording brain event experienced perceived approximately first five year life
Since majority external event experienced child action parent ego state appropriately called Parent
Note event perceived child individual NOT parent often role also recorded Parent
When Transactional Analysts refer Parent ego state opposed biological stepparent capitalized
The go two state Adult Child
Examples recording Parent include Never talk stranger Always chew mouth closed Look way cross street It worth noting recording event young child way filter data event recorded without question without analysis
One consider event imposed child
There data experienced child recorded Parent
This recorded Adult described shortly
In contrast Parent Child represents recording brain event associated external event child perceives
Stated another way stored Child accompanied external event
Like Parent recording Child occur childbirth way age approximately year old
Examples recording Child include When I saw monster face I felt really scared The clown birthday party really funny
The Adult last ego state
Close one year age child begin exhibit gross motor activity
The child learns control cup drink grab toy
In social setting child play
This beginning Adult small child
Adult data grows child ability see different observed Parent felt Child
In word Adult allows young person evaluate validate Child Parental data
Berne describes Adult principally concerned transforming stimulus piece information processing filing information basis previous experience Stated another way Harris describes Adult computer grind decision computing information three source Parent Child data adult gathered gathering One key function Adult validate data parent
An example In example Sally Adult reached conclusion data Parent valid
Her Parent taught always turn pot handle stove otherwise could get And analysis brother experience Adult concluded indeed correct
In attempt explain Transactional Analysis mainstream audience Thomas Harris developed following summary
Although good tool beginner learn keep mind wildly simplified approach effect dumbing Transactional Analysis
The summary follows A comprehensive understanding Berne ego state obtained consulting Berne
Information book found page
When two people communicate one person initiate transaction see Transactions Defined section definition transaction stimulus
The person stimulus directed respond
Simple Transactional Analysis involves identifying ego state directed stimulus ego state person executed response
According Berne For example surgeon survey patient based upon data Adult decides scalpel next instrument required
The surgeon Adult hold hand providing transactional stimulus nurse
The nurse Adult look hand based upon previous experience concludes scalpel needed
The nurse place scalpel surgeon hand
But transaction proceed manner
Some transaction involve ego state Adult
Structural Diagram This lead u Parent Child transaction almost simple transaction
Quoting Berne The fevered child asks glass water nurturing mother brings In Child small child directs inquiry Parent mother
The Parent mother acknowledges stimulus give water child
In example small child request stimulus parent providing water response
This nearly simple transaction
One tool used Transactional Analysis practitioner represented left
A structural diagram represents complete personality individual
It includes Parent Adult Child ego state separate distinct
The diagram developed Eric Berne developing theory Transactional Analysis
Child interacting Parent Transactional Analysts construct diagram showing ego state involved particular transaction
The transaction right show Parent Child transaction Child ego state providing Adult responding
This transaction match Parent Child example listed fevered child asking mother glass water
So far two transaction described considered
In complementary transaction response must go back receiving ego state sending ego state
For example person may initiate transaction directed towards one ego state respondent
The respondent ego state detects stimulus particular ego state meaning ego state stimulus directed produce response
According Berne transaction healthy represent normal human interaction
As Berne say communication proceed long transaction Crossed Transaction However transaction human healthy normal
In case transaction classified In crossed transaction ego state different ego state received stimulus one responds
The diagram right show typical crossed transaction
An example follows Do know cuff link note stimulus directed Respondents Adult
You always blame everything This one classic crossed transaction occurs marriage
Instead Respondent Adult responding I think desk Respondent Child responds back
It important note analyzing transaction one must look beyond said
According Berne one must look word delivered accent particular word change tone volume etc
accompanying word body language facial expression etc
Transactional Analysts pay attention cue analyzing transaction identifying ego state involved
The importance cue understood considering work Berne passed away Mehrabian seminal work published
But Mehrabian work quantitatively proved importance cue communication
According Mehrabian individual speaking listener focus following three type communication Actual Words The Way word delivered tone accent certain word etc
Facial expression In statistic percentage figure indicates degree importance listener place type communication
One see facial expression play far important role communication thus Transactional Analysis actual word exchanged
Berne went discus type transaction discussed
Once reasonable understanding ego state Transactional Analysis achieved game described understood whole new level
Berne went refine theory beyond The classic In addition Berne death others continued build upon Transactional Analysis
Some work seen Bibliography
As stated earlier Berne defined fundamental unit social A stroke unit recognition one person recognizes another person either verbally non verbally
Berne introduced idea stroke Transactional Analysis based upon work Rene Spitz researcher pioneering work area child development
Spitz observed infant deprived handling word receiving stroke prone emotional physical difficulty
These infant lacked cuddling touching handling infant received
Berne took Spitz observation infant developed theory need adult stroke
Berne postulated adult need need physical contact like infant learned substitute type recognition instead physical stimulation
So infant need cuddling adult craves smile wink hand gesture form recognition
Berne defined term requirement adult receive stroke
Berne also reasoned stroke positive negative better stroke
Or summarized stroke better stroke For example walking front house see neighbor likely smile say Your neighbor likely say hello back
This example positive stroke
Your neighbor could also frown say nothing
This example negative stroke
But either case better stroke neighbor ignored completely
student Berne went publish many book Transactional Analysis pioneering work stroke
He developed called

Not inspirational perhaps get right school first try
I loved computer
I taught program high school thought I pretty good Apple Basic assembler time I graduated
I got job typesetting newspaper enrolled university part time taking programming class
I bad enough class I wound flunking enough time
Later I left paper enrolled University Washington
My grade good enough get made exception Alaskans WICHE program
I got poor grade dropped quarter
Still love computer programming intact even though nothing I school said I would good
Finally I went University Alaska Fairbanks
I got mixed grade flunking maybe half dozen course take several time
I stuck graduated
If I smart enough go campus recruiting I would gotten job point done
But I applied job could find one wound grad school despite poor grade grad school I could find would accept
I dropped grad school I lucky enough get job Microsoft
Nobody Microsoft cared grade
They care I graduated mostly show I could stick something
Nevermind I dropped twice dropping grad school come work
My career since pretty good
After first job Microsoft I never trouble finding work
It work history mattered employee education
Should worry poor grade
Sure think getting figure something need fix
In case lot liking class job
If aptitude learning problem computer science SHOULD learning entire career
You get good anything try hard enough
It matter applying
But decide think time spending whether better used elsewhere
If really like computer programming good sign computing good area
As Computer Science Engineering major I learned early year grade matter
They
Do
Not
Matter
What matter drive
If driven passion see even faint amount pursuing CS creating thing stick find right niche Systems programming web development making apps teaching algorithm etc
If driven money still continue computer science far best entry level compensation field study
In long run turn entry level computer science job anything want get faster CS background
The reason CS point time find passion something else fantastic always follow

For MIT senior Shannon Kao expert storytelling essential even especially come coding
The computer science major relies narrative everywhere science fiction writing research educational computer game MIT Media Lab stem childhood replete book
Kao grew Michigan China mother school librarian exposed two younger brother early age everything picture book hefty novel
Instead hanging would grab book sit living room read Kao say laugh
After two semester organic chemistry doused interest medical school Kao stumbled course Introduction Electrical Engineering Computer Science immediately saw computer science way use love math build something tangible interactive
The summer freshman year took research position Affective Computing Group Media Lab worked free app called StoryScape
The program geared toward family developmentally challenged child let user drag drop animated character illustration gallery Kao helped build onto page user write original story share story others
The animated character react stimulus user environment loud noise shaking phone tablet app installed
Working StoryScape graphic gallery Kao first experience computer science lab first research position MIT biology lab even though little expertise field point new research setting immediately felt natural
It important strong story underneath something rest follow say
Kao since expanded research MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program STEP develops learning technology
For past year worked software developer Daniel Wendel research associate MIT Department Urban Studies Planning project called StarLogo
It teach student computer science background build program modeling decentralized system like traffic jam
StarLogo accessibility inexperienced coder hinge system programming work like virtual LEGO brick To build program rather writing line code using individual symbol number user drag drop block text code graphic certain combination text block create functioning program
The process building modeling program way lot like building story need coherent beginning middle end else function
Kao role develop graphic block code
Blocks make programming intuitive people necessarily background say
Kao helped run several workshop make ongoing improvement StarLogo
STEP invite parent child programming background complete series challenge researcher ask feedback usability
Some biggest issue team encountered interface control zooming scrolling
After workshop back lab Kao colleague whittle away list tweak preparation next workshop set feedback
Kao interest telling story design graphic started mindless doodle class soon grew illustration later learned turn animation using computer science skill bring art life
Looking illustration easy see inspiration come Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki Kao cite Disney film Ratatouille favorite animated movie
I feel like part interest art I constant stream picture book young adult book I would read regardless age I say
I still really enjoy picture Kao also work written narrative As literature editor MIT literary magazine sophomore year responsible vetting incoming submission
For past two year focused writing winning MIT Ilona Karmel Prize Science Fiction
Despite passion art literature Kao occupational focus remains computer science always hobby upbringing guidepost

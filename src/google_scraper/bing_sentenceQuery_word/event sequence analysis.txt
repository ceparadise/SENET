special application set method originally designed analyze peptide sequence
Social sequence analysis involves examination ordered process ranging microsocial interaction pattern example dynamic conversation interpersonal contact dynamic development social hierarchy macrosocial temporal pattern
The analysis pattern involve descriptive account sequence pattern statistical analysis narrative event structure analysis dynamic sequencing
After introduced social science period slow growth social sequence method become increasingly prevalent
Sequence analysis method first imported social science biological science sociologist since developed way unique social science
Scholars especially using sequence method ever since
Psychologists used method study order information affect learning identify structure interaction individual
In sociology sequence technique commonly employed study pattern development cycle life history
There great deal work sequential development career increasing interest career trajectory intertwine sequence
Many scholar used sequence technique model work family activity linked household division labor problem schedule synchronization within family
The study interaction pattern increasingly centered sequential concept predominance reciprocal utterance strategic solicitation preferred type response
Social network analyst begun turn sequence method concept understand social contact activity enacted real time model depict whole network evolve
Social network epidemiologist begun examine social contact sequencing better understand spread disease
The use sequence method initially met criticism sociologist objected descriptive orientation early sequence method well lack fit bioinformatic sequence method uniquely social phenomenon
Since surge interest refining sequence method leading major improvement social sequence method
Many methodological development social sequence analysis came heel special issue devoted topic hosted debate method comparing sequence
That debate given rise several methodological innovation address limitation sequence comparison method developed century
In article Balazs Vedre proposed term social sequence analysis distinguish approach bioinformatic
organized another special issue social sequence analysis leading scholar dubbed second wave sequence analysis
Scholars made important contribution social sequence analysis theory technique data collection software development include Roger Bakeman Benjamin Cornwell Laurent Lesnard Christian Ulrich Kohler Cees Elzinga Jonathan Gershuny Raffaella Piccarreta Katherine Stovel
The analysis social sequence pattern foundation sociological theory emerged middle century
Structural theorist argued society system characterized regular pattern
Even seemingly trivial social phenomenon ordered highly predictable way
This idea serf implicit motivation behind social sequence analyst use optimal matching clustering related method identify common class sequence level social organization form pattern search
This focus regularized pattern social action become increasingly influential framework understanding microsocial interaction contact sequence This closely related theory hold social actor behavior predominantly structured routine turn provides predictability sense stability otherwise chaotic rapidly moving social world
This idea also echoed concept emphasizes emergence influence stable worldviews guiding everyday action thus produce predictable orderly sequence behavior
The resulting influence routine structuring influence social phenomenon first illustrated empirically led study found daily life routinized given person able predict accuracy much time spend certain thing following day
Talcott Parsons argument social actor mutually oriented larger social system example family larger community also underlies social sequence analyst interest linkage exist different social actor schedule ordered experience given rise considerable body work social actor social contact larger community
All theoretical orientation together warrant critique social reality applied work implies society either static highly stochastic manner conforms process
This concern inspired initial framing social sequence analysis antidote general linear model
It also motivated recent attempt model sequence activity event term element link social actor network structure
This work turn rooted theory experiencing similar activity experience status serf link social actor
Sequence analysis technique increasingly used study wide variety sequenced ordered social phenomenon
Sequences usually refer phenomenon ordered temporally involving event state unfold period time sequence may also reflect spatial order preference order hierarchical order logical order type order
A variety technique designed describe quantify predict order
Numerous text devoted examination social sequence phenomenon published
Some focused describing structure stochastic microsocial process conversation often studied others focused method detecting sequential pattern social behavior
These approach usually adopt perspective sequential phenomenon focusing given social act contributing group conversation phenomenon entering certain occupation shaped preceding shape subsequent event experience
In work analyst interested particular type social transition dependence state
Here researcher often rely method designed identify causal process especially duration regression method
Research adopts sequence analysis approach treat given transition example transition single married outcome short causal chain antecedent cause
This work therefore provides insight common relationship social state status
A limitation approach divorce transition larger chain event precede follow transition
To draw example cycle argued conflict often result two race group exposed
Over time often give way peaceful coexistence
But likely relation involve gradual development competition conflict accommodation assimilation
It le likely relation fluctuate positive negative yield instability distrust
Only studying whole sequence relation possible understand social context future social phenomenon may unfold
The whole sequence provides richer historical context information single antecedent state provide
Following logic social sequence analyst increasingly view social phenomenon component larger gradual process may may exhibit tightly linked sequential element
This area social sequence analysis focused developing data reduction method detect pattern underlie complex stream social phenomenon
argued method biology information theory computer science provided useful model
Both field developed combination sequence alignment operation facilitate comparison whole sequence
Social scientist adapted method form OM analysis often conjunction technique aid identification common sequence pattern class
Sequence alignment method first used social scientist goal identifying commonality among sequence pattern example common career trajectory common sequence categorizing individual respect class type sequence exhibited
In recent year sequence analyst begun turn method depict measure complex sequence concept process manner sequence state link different social actor together
These technique proved valuable variety context
In research example research shown retirement plan affected last year two one life instead one work family career unfolded period several decade
People followed orderly career path characterized consistent employment gradual within single organization retired earlier others including people intermittent career entered labor force late well enjoyed regular employment made numerous lateral move across organization throughout career
In field research shown firm performance depends firm current recent social network connectedness also durability stability connection firm
Firms durably cohesive ownership network structure attract foreign investment le stable poorly connected structure
Research also used data everyday work activity sequence identify class work schedule finding timing work day significantly affect worker ability maintain connection broader community community event
While method constructing analyzing whole sequence structure developed past three decade including event structure analysis OM sequence comparison method form backbone research whole sequence structure
Social sequence analyst interested number quantifiable property ordered social process measured developed reflect
They include measure sequential connection whether extent sequentially adjacent status depend sense sequential recurrence whether specific event status occur one course given sequence extent state logically prerequisite issue explored event structure analysis form prerequisite analysis whether relationship two sequence state element differs depending sequence relationship evaluated presence spell whether given state element sticky inertia therefore tend reoccur remain occur homogeneity whether sequence characteristic like stationarity similar thus whether sequence structure across subject belong different social grouping race gender
An empirical strength sequence analysis emphasis method visualizing otherwise seemingly overly complex social phenomenon
A variety visual aid especially graph network diagram make easier detect sequence pattern
One visual aid known replace number cell visual symbol reflects magnitude relationship two given state phenomenon
In kind graph symbol size shape varies corresponding transition probability
Transitions occur within set sequence also depicted using diagram called display element node network
This way relationship element emphasized using graphical aid adjusting thickness line state
Transition plot state transition diagram useful depicting pattern transition
They provide information transition occur overall sequence pattern
One visual aid useful respect example provided right side page
This kind graph display every sequence sample
The includes observation stacked top
The depicts sequence position order
The observation sequence index plot arranged case sequence order grouped adjacent
A similar graph called used simplify pattern latent sequence index plot
Like sequence index plot state distribution graph array sequence position order along
The main difference contains individual case prevalence element position
A special type state distribution graph designed specifically temporally ordered sequence data
Finally sequence often depicted network multiple subject sequence shown intersect art specific event instance
This approach common analysis sequence network especially

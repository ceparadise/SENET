An Engineering Change Proposal ECP management tool used propose configuration change CI performance requirement configuration documentation acquisition Government CDCA configuration documentation
The following paragraph define uniform concept principle processing ECPs conducted
These standard ground rule necessary assure consistency orderly process expeditiously accomplished party
The concept section apply class I ECPs except specifically identified applicable class II ECPs
The initiation ECP begin government request unless one reason cited paragraph
Since ECPs occur sole source environment initiation ECP coordinated effort government contractor
A clear mutual understanding ECP objective technical scope Government performance cost schedule constraint shortens ECP preparation
It also result complete comprehensive proposal facilitate timely effective implementation
As process three C Communication Cooperation Coordination key assuring successful change processing
The ECP Management Guide developed assist Government contractor request preparation approval implementing phase ECP
It provides checklist aid timely identification coordination essential technical information required decision making three stage ECP process
It also foster integrated product process team concept
Whenever government identifies need requirement change CI configuration documentation Class I ECP formally requested contractor
A request ECP coordinated applicable government Contracting Officer prior released contractor
As general rule unsolicited Class I ECPs discouraged
However discretion procuring activity preliminary ECP may submitted allow evaluation desirability expending resource fully document proposed change
Changes impact following area instance unsolicited ECPs may justified Safety Compatibility
Correction Defects
Survivability
Security
Product improvement may significantly reduce life cycle cost including Value Engineering Change Proposals VECP consistent DFAR Value Engineering clause applicable contract Technology improvement Formal preliminary ECPs prepared submitted Government accordance configuration management requirement applicable contract SOW associated Contract Data Requirements List CDRL DD Form citing latest approved Data Item Description DID submittal ECP data
The contract CDRL provide information submittal distribution ECPs Government review processing
The contractor ECP Originator notify Government immediately electronic message
Fax need emergency urgent priority ECP determined
message ECP form formal ECP submittal within day
However impracticable preliminary ECP may used interim measure
Both preliminary ECP used final ECP resulting message ECP would identified revision initial message ECP
If Government established Government Configuration Management Automated Information System CM AIS contract data requirement ECPs request either digital submittal ECP data population DoD data base directly contractor access ECP via world wide web
All ECP field information defined EIA Standard data dictionary related XML ECP Business Object
To use MEARS standalone system software must provided contractor
Pertinent data field information ECP data element provided ECP identified described data item description
Only data field populated need provided ECP
Using XML data field tag enable Government various commercial configuration management information system store coherently display ECP data
A significant advantage using electronic commerce paper form topic may addressed entirety without meet paper form block limitation
Obviously key data field identify describe change mandatory ECP
Common sense current context environment program ECP submitted dictate field populated
The typical content ECP may vary considerably CI life cycle DoD Directive give Government Program Managers latitude identifying phase employ two program necessarily
The content guidance provided herein reflects general variability ECP content expected
Supporting data include necessary supplementary information support change description justify need change
Test data analysis technical documentation providing supporting rationale assertion made ECP upon configuration control authority base acceptance proposed change included extent originator feel necessary
In many case proposed change justification easier understand copy draft revision TDP element redlined copy portion specification interface drawing draft table providing new value included data base also provided part ECP package
In order facilitate dispositioning ECPs affecting document Government CDCA contract identify government representative responsible dispositioning Class I Class II ECPs
Where Government Application Activity AA performance based acquisition Government CDCA design documentation contract clearly specify Government contractor responsibility Class I ECPs RFDs affecting Government baselined performance specification
This accomplished incorporating special configuration control clause contract similar example box
Guides dispositioning Class I Class II change provided
Key aspect process highlighted follows Class I ECPs must dispositioned approved disapproved implementation properly constituted Government Configuration Control Board CCB
After CCB direction issued important proceed expeditiously definitization process obtaining pricing proposal auditing fact finding negotiating final price change issuing supplemental agreement
Until contract modification received agreed Government contractor contractor authorized proceed implementation proposed change
The contractual approval disapproval ECP confused acceptance approval ECP data deliverable
Approval ECP data delivery required Form signifies ECP satisfies requirement ECP DID considered acceptable government processing
Acceptance data deliverable signify technical approval change proposed ECP interpreted authorizing performing activity proceed work proposed ECP
All ECPs dispositioned Government expeditiously possible
The ECP indicates date contractual authorization required
This date normally proposed contractor allow sufficient processing time Government
In case expedited processing may necessary order minimize cost change enable incorporated time satisfy operational need
Since certain critical factor safety national defense preparedness may involved important Government proceed due speed also important ensure proper priority need date specified
Because considerable urgency involved effecting change proposed urgent emergency ECPs contractor normally specifies authorization suspense date close submittal date
hour make technical decision emergency ECP calendar day make decision urgent ECP
When urgent emergency priority properly used contractor must authorized proceed implementing change quickly possible
Under circumstance often necessary utilize unilateral change order contract contracting officer letter provide official authorization proceed
If change order used price quotation price cost reduction ECPs would required set limitation price impact change activity accomplished
After change order issued important proceed expeditiously possible normal definitization process minimize risk related price increase maximize related saving resulting change
VECPs subject essentially CCB process ECPs
Under FAR clause Government entitled reimbursement expense incurred processing approved VECP cost saving shared contractor
Therefore tasking activity must develop auditable government cost information complete monetary impact VECP evaluated
Any delay VECP processing typically reduce saving benefit
Unless otherwise specified contract part Single Process Initiative government administrative contracting officer plant representative serf dispositioning authority Class II
The default action required Class II change classification unless contract requires
Government concurrence Class II ECP classification normally allows contractor incorporate change applicable CI update configuration documentation without government action authorization required
A nonconcurrence classification normally result Class II ECP canceled reclassified Class I ECP
The government require class II ECPS Government CDCA original drawing data file compliance specific detailed design requirement contract
If government ACO plant representative available Government tasking activity may elect ACO representative review proposed class II change concurrence classification submitted government activity CDCA approval When ECPs approved change implementation CI produced contract usually straightforward contractual incorporation ECP approved government CCB
CCB approval action considered authority contractor tasking activity proceed change
A CCB directive must prepared published distributed
The CCB directive identified CCB identifier change identifier
The date CCB directive disposition recorded
Distribution limited party required take action implement change If implementation approved change responsibility contractor term contract CCB approval action directs procurement contracting officer initiate instruction contractor If change proposal involved receipt formal contract change example Standard Form Amendment contract PCO letter pending receipt amendment shall constitute sole authority contractor proceed
If initiator government activity acting capacity contractor receipt including funding authorization shall constitute sole authority proceed change
Change implementation CI inventory operational force normally require coordination additional requirement implementing CCB directive tasking order
Necessary instruction funding authorization must issued scheduled implementation changee Change accomplishment reporting directed
The incorporation approved change planned optimum acquisition production test evaluation operational advantage derived modified configuration
The change effectively coordinated ensure earliest possible availability support CI provided minimum disruptive effect planned operating cycle
Changes shall incorporated Contract letter implementing published logistic support available unless safety critical mission requirement dictate otherwise
Unofficial preliminary technical document shall used authority incorporate change
The implementation approved change CI must always include proposed incorporation new revised technical documentation
Provisions change documentation always addressed change proposal contract modification CCB implementing
Change documentation may include type data specification drawing provisioning documentation technical manual diagram sketch part list master configuration list computer program documentation test evaluation procedure
Requirements change documentation may vary depending phase type complexity CI
However documentation prepared change normally include following three category The documentation package including CCB implementing forwarded change installing activity install change
The documentation required technical training maintenance supply management organization properly control support change
The documentation technical manual required user activity properly operate maintain CI change installed
The following ECP Activity Guides provide information concerning change classification justification Class I ECPs type ECPs ECP priority ECP content ECP dispositioning action may apply

The process process requesting determining attainability planning implementing evaluating change
Its main goal support processing traceability change interconnected set factor
There considerable overlap confusion change management
The definition yet integrate area
Change management embraced ability deliver benefit improving affected system thereby satisfying customer need also criticized potential confuse needlessly complicate change administration
In case notably domain fund work put system maintenance change management initial creation system
Typical investment organization initial implementation large system percent overall budget
In vein Hinley describes two Change management also great importance field manufacturing confronted many change due increasing worldwide technological advance demanding customer
Because many system tend change evolve used problem industry experienced degree many others
Notes In process arguable change committee responsible decision also prioritization influence change request batched processing
For description change management process used
Figure depicts explained section
There six main activity jointly form change management process
They Identify potential change Analyze change request Evaluate change Plan change Implement change Review close change
These activity executed four different discussed Table
The activity applicable described Table
Besides activity diagram Figure also show activity

These deliverable concept described Table context important concept CHANGE LOG ENTRY
A concept defined author
lack reference either good definition could found obvious result activity
These concept marked asterisk
Properties concept left model trivial diagram could otherwise quickly become complex
Furthermore concept
CHANGE REQUEST SYSTEM RELEASE lend approach proposed Weerd also left due diagram complexity constraint
Besides change one also distinguish deviation waiver
A deviation authorization request depart requirement item prior creation
A waiver essentially creation item
These two approach viewed minimalistic change management
real solution problem hand
A good example change management process action found
Often user report bug desire new functionality software program lead
The company look technical economical feasibility implementing change consequently decides whether change actually realized
If indeed case change planned example usage
The actual execution change lead creation alteration change propagated probably cause code fragment change well
After initial test result seem satisfactory documentation brought date released together software
Finally project manager verifies change close entry change log
Another typical area change management way treated domain
Take instance design production
If example vehicle air bag found automatically fill air driving long distance without doubt lead customer complaint hopefully problem report testing phase
In turn produce change request see Figure right probably justify change
Nevertheless likely simplistic cost benefit analysis done change request approved
Following analysis impact car design production schedule planning implementation change created
According planning change actually realized new version car hopefully thoroughly tested released public
Since complex process sensitive even small change proper management change industrial facility process recognized critical safety
In US regulation govern change made documented
The main requirement thorough review proposed change performed team ensure many possible viewpoint used minimize chance missing hazard

The goal project would develop Drupal module help size lab manage experimental data
Must Requirements Civil Engineering The app I looking manage race tire
The race engineer crew chief NASCAR must stay constant contact tire technician race weekend
There many parameter must coordinated two frequently updated race
This information includes tire compound cold inflation pressure tire set readied installation car tire set longer going used discarded
The engineer need way rapidly communicate information secure maner tire tech
Additionally detail tire information needed communicated tire tech engineer
This includes tire set available installed car tire hot pressure temperature tire wear concern regarding tire abnormal wear
This information logged allow review race weekend
There also need calculation
The tire cold pressure specified engineer based reference air temperature
As air temperature change weekend cold pressure setting must change
Currently technician must consult engineer change
Often technician engineer work area quite way apart resulting lot lost time technician run work area
I would like app incorporate ability let technician enter air temperature app calculate change cold pressure
I need able app loaded engineer tire technician phone
Because technician often change team I need able enable disable access data
The access able controlled race car I enable new technician half way season access previous race car team
I use app Grand Am road racing I work race engineer

Mechanical Engineering The Problem In youth aged emancipated United States foster care
These youth unable find permanency adoptive family biological family exiting foster care system age eighteen
It well known among child welfare specialist youth formerly foster care face many hardship transition foster care
For instance result Midwest Evaluation Adult Functioning Former Foster Youth study illustrate youth formerly foster care le likely high school diploma
le likely employed compared counterpart
These youth likely suffer mental health behavioral problem incarceration poverty homelessness early pregnancy compared youth never foster care system
The Need The South Carolina National Youth Transition Database SC NYTD team belief would beneficial older youth formerly foster care application connects resource available assist transition adulthood minimize challenge may experience critical time
The SC NYTD Team developed nationally recognized website youth access resource however population youth often consistent internet access result limited access resource available
Because youth age smartphone youth internet user mobile application make SC NYTD resource accessible youth
The resource provided mobile application matter convenience rather matter necessity vulnerable highly competent youth population
For population often experience frequent environment change app would one le important item would remember pack
The Population The application would one first smartphone apps country specifically target youth formerly foster care
The application would geared towards youth need accessing important independent living information transition foster care adulthood
Partnering Solution The potential success youth formerly foster care depend strong partnership among community organization government agency society whole
With social medium especially youth rise clear partnership student School Computer Science Engineering put u forefront initiative youth formerly foster care
The app SC NYTD The application four main section Section One Resources would include information already developed SC NYTD Team job checklist applying independent living service SC Department Social Services DSS scholarship
Specifically scholarship would like application allow user click option would narrow scholarship list one user eligible
Section Two Staying Connected provides user News Events well list youth group South Carolina
This section app would also provide opportunity user sign Listserv well contact SC NYTD Team directly app
Section Three Youth Compass would utilize GPS function allow user use current location find local youth group Department Health Environmental Control office DSS office local soup kitchen homeless shelter local free medical clinic useful community resource assist youth meeting need

Submitted Helen Fields Assistant Director Matt Joy Assistant Director Manager This would mobile app developed iPhone Android measure wait time voting place
The app interest support Google civics project DC
The user experience something like following
The biggest hassle written verification GPS coordinate
We would want someone game system entering start time home
But would exactly time line longest GPS radius would work properly
The believe polling place interaction would allow sort line horrible response
But I think could worked
The GPS data voting location would come Voter Information Project would also help advertising existence app later
Then back end would need software aggregate data
This hard data go cloud Google
Small issue pulling data right format statistic
My guess hard part would would queue time location would different precinct location voting center
So would small messiness output display one would output using whatever location name provided election official
One issue getting advertised
I certainly would think could get Richland County sign
The long line mess election office still major issue
This would big Digital Divide issue perhaps would still get lot information getting
I presented Google something would able claim intellectual property
The basic idea app measure wait time banging backend database location something else would transferable application
I envision problem ownership coming Google

Associate Professor History Tracking music student practice time displaying result graphically maintaining integrity system
absolutely room doubt student fudging number practice time
It proven music student practice practicing becomes game
A year ago tested student record practice session upload file weekly basis
A simple perl script would analyze file post result bar graph
By seeing stood visually weekly basis student naturally motivated practice
It effective parent would write asking program rule amended kid practicing much
That one small detail completely transformed persistent complaint kid never practice kid practicing much
This system level playing field music growth grading competing

A formal agreement need signed Jarrod Haning student beginning work project
Rest assured Jarrod Haning work diligently ensure student receive full credit role project USC future employer
Known Problems If record entire practice session recording device available student
Some student smart phone
even smart phone record entire hour practice session Some student one computer house practice room
Some student slow internet access outdated computer
In pilot test voice recorder used
However available file huge problematic many student upload
They bought factory wholesale Hong Kong
This could done provided cost recorder kept low enough
If using recording proof verify
How know student open Garageband copy paste turn minute hour
How know student set recorder front YouTube hour every day
In pilot study perl script looked pattern silence determine signature
But script weak easily defeated required gob processing time
This may may good long term scalable solution
An initial attempt check copy paste appeared extremely difficult
And trying solve cheat recording recording beyond scope pilot study
It precisely problem project seen worthy graduate student project
If device listen select cue
That would helpful would uploading small file measured KB GB would cue would determine practice session authentic faked
The database house information must scalable well
A Music teacher need able open account give student access program without behind scene administrative support
Just like I create account YouTube real person setting system piece code automating bucket database
Further Discussion Please call email question
Jarrod Haning The project involves app evaluate integration
The task draw touch screen computer using stylus geometric design shown part screen
An example would something simple square circle circle square overlap touch particular corner
The app would digitize drawing automatically provide score accurate design drawn based drawing resemblance shown design
For I mind using computer like MS surface pro tablet computer come highly sensitive pen

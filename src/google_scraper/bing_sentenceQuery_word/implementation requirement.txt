It like saying multiplication part tool set math learn math multiplication
Wilson adamantly legislation
It hurt computer science language said
A similar bill passed Kentucky Senate still need clear House
New Mexico also
And Tony Cárdenas introduced federal legislation December would designate programming language critical foreign language
This wildfire Stephenson said proposal
We understand trying go route
Make count math science credit
In Kentucky advocate pushed back proposed legislation part concern would reduce student option learning language
David Givens Republican state senator sponsored bill said would prefer computer science fulfill math science requirement state already stringent course requirement
It much challenge anything said
Even legislation broaden access computer science moving forward hurdle school implementation remain
First issue finding qualified teacher
Most state allow teacher certified computer science teacher said Stephenson
So either force teacher get secondary endorsement let anybody teach course
Related Blog States end dealing Ericson Georgia Tech call problem program wo train teacher state computer science certification state wo create certification program teacher training
Among teacher proficient computer science turnover problem said Ericson
They often leave classroom job industry
And student interest ca taken granted either
Surprisingly train teacher get excited go back teach ca get enough student said Derbenwick Miller

To complete MSCS degree need unit Stanford
Units counting towards Stanford BS program transfer unit eligible
The unit come four area These course required student program may waived student taken similar previous course
All waiver must approved advisor
If student already completed SI course breadth depth elective must complete one graduating
The following list approved significant implementation course After finishing one two depth requirement student may take qualified elective get unit
Qualified elective Here rule While require MSCS student complete research thesis student pursue departmental honor called distinction research
great option interested research considering possible program career researcher
The goal produce work publishable journal conference
The requirement formally stated go distinction research Your program sheet serf proposal showing could graduate MSCS
cast stone free revise resubmit program sheet make change
Completing program sheet valuable exercise though help focus academic career
We encourage new student meet faculty advisor assigned Orientation September first couple week talk academic plan
Early talk waiver like request find soon whether take foundation course
In first quarter try file program sheet
Again free change later helpful planning make time
To submit program sheet If make change plan later need resubmit program sheet
best keep plan reasonably particularly want deviation
If already gotten advisor sign waiver deviation write program sheet rather reapplying
Be sure submit final program sheet beginning final quarter need wait already know class going take
The MSCS program unit student take two year complete
That work roughly unit per quarter common courseload MSCS student maximum allowed TAship RAship
This typically translates two three class
New student often tempted plunge right load first quarter
We advise
Your first quarter probably still adjusting Stanford maybe want explore area accustomed coursework another school may significantly different
We suggest leaning toward lighter quarter first ramping later find comfort level
Courses vary widely type intensity workload correspond course number number unit handy rule thumb
Most people find happiest balancing quarter variety type work
programming problem set design work
Taking three heavy programming class large final project one quarter may great idea
Some factor consider evaluating course fit together quarter To get feel sort thing take look talk Course Advisor
Also unit spare consider taking fun unit activity course area like athletics dance music
While course certainly count toward unit still enroll nice form stress relief
Stanford somewhat unique make student class
There notable exception class limited enrollment new class
This give opportunity get feel class like commit schedule
HOWEVER must preliminary study list filed enrolled least unit first day quarter

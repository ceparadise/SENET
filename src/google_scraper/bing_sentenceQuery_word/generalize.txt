The ability abstract generalize essential part intellectual activity
Abstraction generalization fundamental mathematics philosophy essential computer science well
The importance abstraction derived ability hide irrelevant detail use name reference object
Programming language provide abstraction procedure function module permit programmer distinguish program implemented
The primary concern user program
This contrast writer program whose primary concern implemented
Abstraction essential construction program
It place emphasis object rather represented work
Thus primary mean managing complexity large program
Of le importance generalization
While abstraction reduces complexity hiding irrelevant detail generalization reduces complexity replacing multiple entity perform similar function single construct
Programming language provide generalization variable parameterization generic polymorphism
Generalization essential construction program
It place emphasis similarity object
Thus help manage complexity collecting individual group providing representative used specify individual group
Abstraction generalization often used together
Abstracts generalized parameterization provide greater utility
In parameterization one part entity replaced name new entity
The name used parameter
When parameterized abstract invoked invoked binding parameter argument
Figure summarizes notation used abstraction generalization
When abstraction fully parameterized free variable bound parameter abstraction may understood without looking beyond abstraction
Abstraction generalization depend principle referential transparency
denote name abstract
Declarations definition instance use abstraction programming language In addition naming second aspect abstraction
It abstract encapsulated detail abstract hidden name sufficient represent entity
This aspect abstraction considered detail later chapter
An object said understood without reference thing external object
We could equally well say instead name
A entity whose value fixed may vary
Names bound variable declaration statement
Among various term abstract found text
A perform binding independently combine binding produce completed set binding
Nether binding reference name used binding
Collateral binding common occur Scheme ML
The common way composing binding sequentially
A perform binding sequence occur
The effect allow later binding use binding produced earlier sequence
It must noted sequential binding permit mutually recursive definition
In Pascal constant variable procedure function binding sequential
To provide mutually recursive definition function procedure Pascal provide separation signature function procedure body mean function prototype forward declaration mutually recursive definition may constructed
A one name bound used directly indirectly binding
Programming language require declaration reference invent special mechanism handle forward reference
For dynamic data type rule relaxed permit definition pointer type
For function procedure separate declaration signature function procedure body
Pascal forward declaration function prototype typical
The declaration reference often chosen simplify construction compiler
In Java choice made simplify programmer task rather compiler permit forward reference
A module system provides way writing large program various piece program interfere another name clash also provides way hiding implementation detail
A module generally consists two part export part local part
The export part module consists language declaration symbol available use either part module module import module declaration giving symbol module available use either part module module import
The local part module consists language declaration symbol avaliable use part
The work constructing large program divided among several people must produce part whole
Each part called module programmer must able construct module without knowing internal detail part
This possible module separated interface part implementation part
The interface part describes information required use module implementation part describes implementation
This idea already present programming language manner function procedure defined
Function procedure definition usually separated two part
The first part give subprogram name parameter requirement second part describes implementation
A module generalization concept abstraction module permitted contain collection definition
An additional goal module confine change module rather throughout program
While concept module useful abstraction full advantage module gained module may written compiled possibly executed separately
In many case module able tested independently module
EXPANDTHIS
Advantages called lambda abstraction denote generalization called replacing number occurrence part The parameter said expression said
The symbol
Quantifiers used replace constant variable
The specialization elaboration generic called application take form It denotes expression B obtained lambda expression free occurences replaced name parameter abstract
The invocation abstract take form occaisionally name called whose value substituted parameter
Upon invocation abstract argument bound parameter
Figure summarizes variety notation used denote elaboration generalization
Most programming language permit implicit form generalization variable may introduced without providing invocation procedure replaces parameter argument
For example consider following psudocode program computes circumference circle The Principle Generalization make restriction parameter part entity may parameterized
Neither programming language
This emphasized following principle We use notation denote substitution
The notation read E p expression obtained E replacing free occurrence p
formed two similar factor
The factor generalize common expression The lambda expression use rewrite product The lambda expression abstracted name three argument used replace lambda expression name get expression clearly indicates similarity factor
Figure present two style block first requires definition proceed body second requires definition follow body
A program block structure consists one block
This structure typical BASIC early version COBOL
The monolithic structure suitable small program
The scope every definition entire program
Typically definition grouped one place even used different part program
A program block structure partitioned distinct block outer inclosing block one inner block body may contain additional block inner block may contain block
This structure typical FORTRAN In language subprogram procedure function separate act block
Variables declared inside subprogram local subprogram
Subprogram name part outer block thus scope entire program along global variable
All subprogram name global variable must unique
If variable local subprogram must global accessable subprogram even though used couple subprogram
A program block structure block may nested inside block restriction nesting block within body
This typical block structure language
A block located close point use
In block visibility controlled nesting
All name visible implicitly exported internally nested block
No name visible exported enclosing block
In block name visible declared enclosing block declared block declared nested block
D A name referenced within block refers name declared outside block
An block time interval block executed
The three basic block structure sufficient called PITS
These program comprehensible entirety individual programmer
However general enough large program
Large program written many individual must consist module developed tested independently module
Such programming called PITL
The scope rule module define relationship among name within partition
There four choice
implementation ease cheap generalization parameterless function
Scope range visibility name
For example national boundary may encapsulate natural language
However word used within boundary native word
They word borrowed language defined foreign language
So program
A definition introduces name boundary object
The object may contain name local definition assuming definition may nested
These name said free
The meaning assigned name found outside definition
The rule followed determining meaning free name called scope rule
It concerned name control
X X A program may composed main program execution may call subprogram turn may call subprogram
When subprogram called calling subprogram wait called subprogram terminate
Each subprogram expected eventually terminate return control calling subprogram
The execution calling subprogram resume point immediately following point call
Each subprogram may local data found
An activation record consists association variable value assigned
An activation record may created time subprogram called destroyed subprogram terminates
DYNAMIC STATIC ALLOCATION The run time environment must keep track current instruction referencing environment active waiting program subprogram terminates proper instruction data environment may selected calling subprogram
The current instruction calling subprogram maintained stack
When subprogram called address instruction following call calling program pushed stack
When subprogram terminates instruction pointer set address top stack address popped stack
The stack often called
The address current environment also maintained stack
The top stack always point current environment
When subprogram called address new environment pushed stack
When subprogram terminates stack popped revealing previous environment
The stack often called stack contains link pointer reveal dynamic history program
When programming language permit recursive procedure data structure size independent computed input data maximum storage requirement program determined compile time
This simplifies run time support required program possible statically allocate storage used program execution
argument must evaluated determine value arithmetic expression conditional expression strict second third argument since selection second third argument dependent value boolean condition first argument
Most programming language assume abstract strict parameter therefore parameter evaluated function called
This evaluation scheme called
This always desirable language provide mechanism programmer inform function evaluate parameter
Scheme provides quote operator prevent evaluation argument
Logic language like Prolog functional language language like Haskell Miranda language argument evaluated value required
This evaluation scheme called often implemented using argument evaluated first needed
Most language use strict evaluation efficient simplifies implementation parameter passing imperative programming language
evaluation coupled found imperative langauges produce unexpected result
provides parameter passing mechanism pas name based provide generality required imperative model following example show
The requires value copied generic entered copied generic generic exited
This form parameter passing often referred
The formal parameter local variable argument copied local variable entry generic copied local variable argument exit generic
The Pascal Ada example parameter may passed using copy mechanism
The value argument copied parameter entry value formal parameter copied actual parameter exit
In imperative language copying unnecessary language prohibits assignment formal parameter
In case parameter may passed reference
Ada function result example parameter may passed using copy mechanism
The value argument actual parameter copied formal parameter entry value parameter copied argument upon exit
In Pascal function name used parameter assignment may made function name
This form parameter passing often referred
When passing value result combined passing mechanism referred
Ada example parameter may passed form copy mechanism
The value actual parameter copied formal parameter entry value formal parameter copied actual parameter upon exit
The copy mechanism disadvantage
The copying large composite value array etc expensive parameter must assignable
expression file type Pascal assignable
The effect abstact surrounded block definition bind parameter argument
An parameter said passed argument address
References parameter reference argument
Assignments parmeter assignment argument
The Pascal array structure parameter passed using mechanism
A toster provides illustration effect passing reference
If argument A parameter said passed effect argument replaces parameter throughout body subroutine textual substitution suitable renaming local variable avoid conflict local variable variable occuring argument subprogram reference parameter result evaluation argument calling environment
In addition problem mechanism imperative language reference parameter present possibility
Aliasing occurs two name reference object
For example following procedure call ALLOCATION When subprogram called new uninitialized stack element pushed stack corresponding variable block
A reference variable involves inspection updating top element appropriate stack
This provides access variable closest block respect dynamic calling sequence
When subprogram terminates stack corresponding variable block popped restoring calling environment
The may implemented follows
The data section procedure associated
The activation record dynamically allocated space stack
Each recursive call associated activation record
Associated activation record point previous activation record address instruction executed upon return procedure provides access referencing environment
An activation record consists storage local variable static dynamic link return address
The runtime stack activation record local data static dynamic link
Global data value found following static chain appropriate activation record
An alternative method implementation static scope rule display
A set register hardware software contain pointer current environment
On procedure call current display pushed onto runtime stack new display constructed containing revised environment
On procedure exit display restored copy stack
There number mechanism partitioning program text
Functions procedure among common
However result still single file
When partition program text arranged separate file partition called module
Here several program partitioning mechanism
There number mechanism combining partition single program purpose compilation execution
The statement provided number language
It compiler directive directs compiler textually include named file source program
In system partition may separately compiled linking phase compiled program module linked together execution
In system missing function procedure result search missing module found executed found result error
In program construction module designer must answer following question
Modules must provide answer two question Functions procedure simple module
Their signature description body describes achieved
More typically module group component type constant variable procedure function
To present narrow interface module module make component visible outside
Such component said module
The component said inside module
The hidden component used implement exported component
Access component often qualified name
When strong safety consideration important module using component another module may required explicitly required module desired component

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

Data structure seen important equal algorithm
This view especially encouraged situation appropriate data structure main factor allows algorithm exist perform satisfying complexity
However despite additional feature data structure
organization like tree storing entry according relation data structure keeping information unchanged algorithm action
Can generic feature data structure izolated defined abstract way
Notice data structure store accessible element
This probably mean I would consider
Take example binary search tree
This tree store information order element
In particular traversal output sorted sequence element stored tree linear time
There roughly different full binary tree n leaf
Thus data structure store additional bit case
Maybe view help
Some algorithmic problem problem
So take input process hopefully output solution
Other problem however trying solve several problem part input mostly
Here might pay preprocess static input data request easier answer
The result preprocessing stored often form labeled graph
This store data data structure
The paragraph explained static data structure behave
Usually data structure dynamic allowing alter represented data associated information
I add answer different aspect An ADT The generic data feature ADTs besides storing interface operation element

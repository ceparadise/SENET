When designing program often point condition need tested order make decision
Conditions formed using Boolean logic
use simple comparison help make decision
form algebra either True False
These value true false used test based around
Boolean logic us algebra algebraic expression
We use expression algorithm program
Most programming language use equivalent Boolean expression
However slightly different equivalent

I trouble simplifying logical expression much simpler form someone provide insight approach problem
Let assume following expression ABCD B CD
I aware De Morgan law sure apply case
Thank
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
What kind simplification looking
In case given B ACD B ACD
In case set law Boolean algebra might helpful
Starting expression simplify applying normal algebraic method le obvious case using

Boolean refers system logical thought used create statement
A Boolean value express truth value either true false
Boolean expression use operator AND OR XOR NOT compare value return true false result
Boolean logic developed George Boole English mathematician philosopher become basis modern digital computer logic
Because computer operate binary computer logic often represented Boolean term
For example Boolean logic may describe computer circuit state charged true charged false
This describes basic binary concept upon computer processing based
Boolean logic also commonly seen performing Web search search engine
For example person searching document contains word Boolean computer science search phrase might created using Boolean operator Boolean computer science
In case operator tell search engine seeking result contain term
Similarly search phrase Boolean computer science tell search engine seek result contain first term omit result include term

Hello I need help xy xor z I logic AND first XOR parenthesis
Thank You Usually operator written implicitly putting operand next xy logic arithmetic precedence binary operator written explicitly logic arithmetic
Indeed author us different convention need good stern talking
But note convention
So expression question mean xy z unless person wrote hate u
This view reinforced fact logical multiplication modulo xor addition modulo expect multiplication precedence addition
By posting answer agree

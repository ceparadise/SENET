It true order obtain patent one must obtain patent United States preference must likewise disclosed
What typically appreciated though critical time satisfying disclosure requirement time application filed
In many situation improvement made invention even filing patent application additional information learned
None additional information must disclosed instead kept secret
Virtually patent license include clause require inventor disclose trade secret
Frequently information disclosed patent commercially viable
Thus patent licensors take step continue maintain trade secret secret otherwise lost
Accordingly disclosing secret already protected issued patent licensor use

Industrial espionage theft trade secret go back far history civilization
In ancient China death torture penalty revealing secret silk making outsider
Today penalty theft trade secret perpetrator get caught usually financial
Although theft exists almost area American business computer industry particularly susceptible problem due following mix ingredient Thus computer industry research expensive need know great many company shown willing take risk involved technology theft
This willingness fueled exacerbated widespread recognition trade secret litigation costly slow misappropriation often difficult prove
It generally believed theft go undiscovered discovered go unprosecuted
This article focus three area law
First practically speaking trade secret owner protect
Second difference protection two form intellectual property protection provided law copyright patent protection
Third employer right former employee employee new employer theft suspected
I
What Trade Secret
There many attempt court commentator create generic definition proven difficult
Many court taken approach pornography I ca define I know I see
However purpose application law distilled following definition A trade secret secret give owner actual potential advantage business owner exercise reasonable measure maintain secret
As many broad definition one need explanation
First limitation subject matter trade secret
As practical matter appear almost none
Some commonly recognized subject protection scientific process kind product blueprint algorithm content pending patent application database compilation manufacturing process technical data result test knowledge certain approach problem work negative customer list financial information result market research study internal costing pricing information
In Massachusetts state court protected formula chocolate chip cooky proportion ingredient herbal dog food
The Massachusetts federal district court expressly held computer source code may qualify trade secret
It critical understanding law appreciate protectable trade secret need single idea invention combination process invention individually already public domain
As one court stated trade secret exist combination characteristic component public domain unified process design operation unique combination affords competitive advantage protectable secret
II
What Secret
A secret necessarily something possessed one person something generally known
By way example take following hypothetical
Company A developed data compression algorithm give competitive advantage
Several computer company necessarily competitor also independently developed similar algorithm
One Company A employee go work one competitor algorithm reveals secret
Company A brings suit former employee competitor one defense several member industry posse secret therefore secret
Will defense succeed
Almost certainly
A trade secret independently discovered owned one company still remain trade secret
On hand assume employee one company independently discovered algorithm written technical paper describing paper published academic journal
At point trade secret available many library longer considered trade secret Company A suit likely fail
As practical matter many trade secret case whether secret become general knowledge black white question fact judge jury must decide
Third much effort trade secret owner expend preserve trade secret
The answer law demand secrecy however demand absolute secrecy owner take reasonable measure protect secret
In part constitutes reasonable measure depends nature sought protected
Many court recognized spectrum trade secret secret entitled different degree treatment depending fall spectrum
At one end hard secret chemical formula source code product blue print thing sort employee either know know confidential nature
At opposite end spectrum periphery protection soft secret customer list business plan general financial marketing information
In case hard trade secret court willing overlook absence confidentiality agreement even relatively weak precaution protect secret find confidential relationship provides protection
Even absence contract containing confidentiality provision court willing find implied contract confidentiality
In case soft secret customer list marketing plan like owner alleged secret show took considerable precaution protect information expects court provide protection
Because uncertainty distinction lend lawsuit involving litigation trade secret company believing owns trade secret would reckless rely implied contract
Express contract nondisclosure confidentiality agreement unequivocally best way achieve protection
To ensure trade secret lost lack secrecy precaution following measure taken Efforts kind protect secrecy enormously persuasive suite show company took trade secret seriously went significant effort protect
In preliminary injunction proceeding plaintiff asking court take extraordinary step enjoining defendant use certain technology pending full trial precaution prove critical
Often extremely difficult judge make determination whether fact secret involved stage litigation heavily influenced extent plaintiff show treated information question trade secret
Similarly trial case jury difficulty understanding subtle distinction technology concluding whether technology issue indeed secret plaintiff industry may heavily influenced fact plaintiff took careful precaution treat secret
III
Suing Your Former Employee New Employer The common form dispute employee leaf company posse trade secret either start competitive business go work competitor
Often situation former employer immediate evidence employee revealing secret new employer new employer making use
All former employer strong suspicion
A
The Former Employee Suing former employee misappropriation brings play directly competing policy
On one hand law recognizes employer entitled enforce right even former employee
On hand strong public policy encourage employee use general skill knowledge acquired employment
The policy favoring employee mobility put burden employer
As one Massachusetts court stated employer asserting misappropriation skilled employee bear heavy burden isolating secret claim protection demonstrating employee left free use knowledge skill brought employment
Thus case former employee battle line clearly drawn employer portray employee seeking profit trade secret taken employer employee argue employer seeking restrain competition try force employer identify specifically possible trade secret seek protect
In one respect success owner suit former employee depend owner ability narrowly define describe trade secret show court owner followed strict secrecy precaution
B
The New Employer What right liability new employer purchaser license misappropriated technology
It clear law imposes liability breach confidential relationship also third party notice breach benefit
Usually third party new employer one purchase license technology embodying secret one misappropriated
The key element far new employer concerned notice
The new employer must know reason know new employee access trade secret may breach confidential relationship
Notice may constructive actual
Constructive notice arises new employer reasonably know new employee may acting improperly
Of course case plaintiff must prove constructive notice may involve difficult issue proof whether new employer known inferred receiving trade secret
By far better situation former employer owner new employer actual notice potential breach confidential relationship
This accomplished sending letter new employer return receipt requested indicating new employee knowledge trade secret general subject matter trade secret explanation legal basis employee obligation maintain secrecy example nondisclosure agreement virtue foregoing owner may cause action new employer
If new employer either actual constructive notice employee acting improperly new employer argue permitted avoid liability acted good faith
Some practical pointer
What owner suspect former employee may inclined reveal trade secret new employer
If owner give immediate notice benefit taking away new employer good faith defense
On hand owner may accusing former employee intention disclosing trade secret
Worse owner may alerting new employer new employee knowledge potential misappropriation result none previously contemplated
There general answer problem
The owner must act basis considering factor might relevant

How company act one hiring former employee competitor
First part every employer standard employment agreement new employee required certify illegally providing employer trade secret
Second new employer consider sending letter employee former employer informing new employer aware employee access trade secret intention inducing permitting use disclosure secret
This letter might forestall litigation case litigation ensues helpful showing new employer acted good faith

The activity constitute reasonable measure maintain trade secret vary case case relative rather absolute secrecy required
At least owner trade secret require person including employee allowed access trade secret execute confidentiality agreement
Some court held enough merely employee sign nondisclosure agreement outset employment assume completely protects trade secret employee exposed course employment employer must emphasize specific aspect employee work subject confidentiality restriction
Some court held trade secret status may lost little single unprotected disclosure example disclosure without confidentiality agreement
Although extreme view critical realize court take literally requirement trade secret treated time
Several unprotected disclosure almost certainly result loss trade secret right
It permissible legally obtain product incorporates trade secret purchasing reverse engineering product discover secret
However important recognize many product containing trade secret sold licensed express restriction reverse engineering
For example computer software object code form usually licensed term prohibit reverse engineering program object code source code
As discussed article recent case Vault Quaid issue restriction may enforceable imposed license
A patent arises result express grant federal government following long expensive application process trade secret require state federal action order exist
It possible trade secret eligible patent protection requirement originality novelty far stricter patentability trade secret many thing protected trade secret eligible patent protection
A patent provides protection year date grant year expires invention unprotectible manner
A trade secret contrast may perpetual duration
During period patent application considered Patent Office application available public trade secret status content application may maintained event patent denied
Copyright law protects expression idea underlying idea therefore scope protection much narrower trade secret law
If one way express idea copyright law provides protection
Copyright trade secret protection often mutually exclusive since publication work reveals work public thereby giving claim trade secrecy

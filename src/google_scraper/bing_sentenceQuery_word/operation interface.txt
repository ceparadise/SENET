Software interface provide access computer resource memory CPU storage etc
underlying computer system direct access
well designed interface resource software major disastrous functionality stability
Interfaces software component provide type specification
Sometimes public also defined part interface
The interface software module deliberately defined separately module
The latter contains actual code procedure method described interface well private variable procedure etc
Another software module example interacts forced published interface
One practical advantage arrangement replacing implementation another implementation interface cause internally meet requirement interface relevant specification interface

In language term often used define contains data code defines behavior signature
A code data method corresponding interface said interface
Furthermore class implement multiple interface hence different type time
An interface thus definition anywhere object exchanged example call object exchanged defined term interface rather specifying particular
This approach mean class implement interface used
For example may used allow development progress final implementation available
In another case implementation may substituted testing
Such implementation replaced real code later development process
Usually method defined interface contains code thus called must implemented code run invoked
An interface called might define two method
It implemented different way example first fast working stack fixed size second using data structure resized cost somewhat lower speed
Though interface contain many method may contain one even none
For example language defines interface single method various implementation used different purpose including
like contain method serve provide information generic processing using
The use interface allows programming style called

The field space interaction human machine occur
The goal interaction allow effective operation control machine human end whilst machine simultaneously feed back information aid operator process
Examples broad concept user interface include interactive aspect computer hand operator control control
The design consideration applicable creating user interface related involve discipline
Generally goal produce user interface make easy efficient enjoyable operate machine way produce desired result
This generally mean operator need provide minimal input achieve desired output also machine minimizes undesired output human
With increased use relative decline societal awareness heavy machinery term user interface generally assumed mean industrial control panel machinery control design discussion commonly refer interface
Other term user interface machine question computer
The user interface part machine handle interaction

Nowadays use expression interface computer nearly using graphic
There difference user interface operator interface interface HMI
In HMI sometimes used refer better described
However latter usage seeing increasing application use medical artificial extension replaces missing body part
In circumstance computer might observe user react according action without specific command
A mean tracking part body required sensor noting position head direction gaze used experimentally
This particularly relevant
The history user interface divided following phase according dominant type user interface In batch era computing power extremely scarce expensive
User interface rudimentary
Users accommodate computer rather way around user interface considered overhead software designed keep processor maximum utilization little overhead possible
The input side user interface batch machine mainly equivalent medium like
The output side added medium
With limited exception system human being interact batch machine real time
Submitting job batch machine involved first preparing deck punched card describing program dataset
Punching program card done computer specialized machine notoriously bulky unforgiving prone mechanical failure
The software interface similarly unforgiving strict syntax meant parsed smallest possible compiler interpreter
Once card punched one would drop job queue wait
Eventually
operator would feed deck computer perhaps mounting supply another dataset helper software
The job would generate printout containing final result often abort notice attached error log
Successful run might also write result magnetic tape generate data card used later computation
The single job often spanned entire day
If one lucky might hour response unheard
But worse fate card queue computer actually required even tedious process toggling program binary code using console switch
The earliest machine actually partly rewired incorporate program logic using device known
Early batch system gave currently running job entire computer program deck tape include would think code talk device whatever housekeeping needed
Midway batch period various group began experiment system
These used always resident computer
Programs could call monitor service
Another function monitor better error checking submitted job catching error earlier intelligently generating useful feedback user
Thus monitor represented first step towards operating system explicitly designed user interface
CLIs evolved batch monitor connected system console
Their interaction model series transaction request expressed textual command specialized vocabulary
Latency far lower batch system dropping day hour second
Accordingly system allowed user change mind later stage transaction response feedback earlier result
Software could exploratory interactive way possible
But interface still placed relatively heavy mnemonic load user requiring serious investment effort learning time master

CUA successfully created know use today Windows recent DOS Windows Console Applications use standard well
This defined pulldown menu system top screen status bar bottom shortcut key stay common functionality Open example would work application followed SAA standard
This greatly helped speed user could learn application caught quick became industry standard
Primary method used interface design include prototyping simulation
Typical interface design consists following stage interaction specification interface software specification prototyping All great interface share eight quality characteristic The POLA general principle design kind interface
It based idea human being pay full attention one thing one time leading conclusion novelty minimized
If interface used persistently user unavoidably develop using interface
The designer role thus characterized ensuring user form good habit
If designer experienced interface similarly develop habit often make unconscious assumption regarding user interact interface

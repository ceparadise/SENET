The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

The philosopher influenced set stage technological revolution remade world
computer often told history object abacus Babbage engine machine World War II
In fact better understood history idea mainly idea emerged mathematical logic obscure discipline first developed century
Mathematical logic pioneered notably George Boole Gottlob Frege inspired Leibniz dream universal concept language ancient logical system Aristotle
Mathematical logic initially considered hopelessly abstract subject conceivable application
As one computer scientist If talented sympathetic outsider called upon survey science name branch would least fruitful century ahead choice might well settled upon mathematical And yet would provide foundation field would impact modern world
The evolution computer science mathematical logic culminated two landmark paper Claude Shannon Alan Turing In history computer science Shannon Turing towering figure importance philosopher logician preceded frequently overlooked
A history computer science describes Shannon paper possibly important also noted master thesis Shannon wrote electrical engineering student MIT
His adviser Vannevar Bush built prototype computer known could rapidly calculate differential equation
The device mostly mechanical subsystem controlled electrical relay organized ad hoc manner yet systematic theory underlying circuit design
Shannon thesis topic came Bush recommended try discover theory
Shannon paper many way typical paper filled equation diagram electrical circuit
What unusual primary reference work mathematical philosophy George Boole
well known computer scientist many programming language basic data type called Boolean rarely read outside philosophy department
Shannon encountered Boole work undergraduate philosophy class
It happened one else familiar field time later
Boole often described mathematician saw philosopher following footstep Aristotle
begin description goal investigate fundamental law operation human mind The design following treatise investigate fundamental law operation mind reasoning performed give expression symbolical language Calculus upon foundation establish science Logic finally collect probable intimation concerning nature constitution human mind
He pay tribute Aristotle inventor logic primary influence In ancient scholastic form indeed subject Logic stand almost exclusively associated great name Aristotle
As presented ancient Greece partly technical partly metaphysical disquisition scarcely essential change continued present day
Trying improve logical work Aristotle intellectually daring move
Aristotle logic presented book occupied central place scholarly canon year
It widely believed Aristotle written almost say topic
The great philosopher Immanuel Kant since Aristotle logic unable take single step forward therefore seems appearance finished Aristotle central observation argument valid based logical structure independent word involved
The famous argument schema discussed known syllogism You replace Socrates object mortal predicate argument remains valid
The validity argument determined solely logical structure
The logical word therefore work
Aristotle also defined set basic axiom derived rest logical system These axiom meant describe people actually think would realm psychology idealized perfectly rational person ought think
Aristotle axiomatic method influenced even famous book Euclid second Bible number edition printed
Although ostensibly geometry became standard textbook teaching rigorous deductive reasoning
Abraham Lincoln said learned sound legal argumentation studying Euclid
In Euclid system geometric idea represented spatial diagram
Geometry continued practiced way René Descartes showed geometry could instead represented formula
His mathematics text West popularize standard algebraic notation x z variable b c known quantity
mathematician move beyond spatial intuition manipulate symbol using precisely defined formal rule
This shifted dominant mode mathematics diagram formula leading among thing development calculus invented roughly year Descartes independently Isaac Newton Gottfried Leibniz
Boole goal Aristotelean logic Descartes done Euclidean geometry free limit human intuition giving precise algebraic notation
To give simple example Aristotle wrote All men mortal
Boole replaced word men mortal variable logical word arithmetical operator Which could interpreted Everything set also set The created new scholarly following year became one active area research mathematician philosopher
Bertrand Russell called work pure mathematics Shannon insight Boole system could mapped directly onto electrical circuit
At time electrical circuit systematic theory governing design
Shannon realized right theory would exactly analogous calculus proposition used symbolic study He showed correspondence electrical circuit Boolean operation simple chart This correspondence allowed computer scientist import decade work logic mathematics Boole subsequent logician
In second half paper Shannon showed Boolean logic could used create circuit adding two binary digit
By stringing adder circuit together arbitrarily complex arithmetical operation could constructed
These circuit would become basic building block known key component modern computer
characterize Shannon achievement first distinguish layer computer
This distinction become fundamental computer science might seem surprising modern reader insightful reminder adage philosophy one century common sense Since Shannon paper vast amount progress made physical layer computer including invention transistor William Shockley colleague Bell Labs
Transistors dramatically improved version Shannon electrical relay best known way physically encode Boolean operation
Over next year semiconductor industry packed transistor smaller space
A iPhone billion transistor one relay switch like pictured Shannon diagram
While Shannon showed map logic onto physical world Turing showed design computer language mathematical logic
When Turing wrote paper trying solve decision problem first identified mathematician David Hilbert asked whether algorithm could determine whether arbitrary mathematical statement true false
In contrast Shannon paper Turing paper highly technical
Its primary historical significance lie answer decision problem template computer design provided along way
Turing working tradition stretching back Gottfried Leibniz philosophical giant developed calculus independently Newton
Among Leibniz many contribution modern thought one intriguing idea new language called imagined could represent possible mathematical scientific knowledge
Inspired part religious philosopher Leibniz postulated language would ideographic like Egyptian hieroglyphic except character would correspond atomic concept math science
He argued language would give humankind instrument could enhance human reason far greater extent optical instrument like microscope telescope
He also machine could process language called calculus ratiocinator
If controversy arise would need disputation two philosopher two accountant
For would suffice take pencil hand say u calculate
opportunity develop universal language corresponding machine although invent relatively simple calculating machine
The first credible attempt realize Leibniz dream came German philosopher Gottlob Frege published landmark logic treatise Inspired Boole attempt improve Aristotle logic Frege developed much advanced logical system
The logic taught philosophy class predicate slight modification Frege system
Frege generally considered one important philosopher century
Among thing credited catalyzing noted philosopher Richard Rorty called philosophy
As Enlightenment philosophy obsessed question knowledge philosophy Frege became obsessed question language
His disciple included two important philosopher Russell Ludwig Wittgenstein
The major innovation Frege logic much accurately represented logical structure ordinary language
Among thing Frege first use quantifier every exists separate object predicate
He also first develop today fundamental concept computer science like recursive function variable scope binding
Frege formal language called made meaningless symbol manipulated rule
The language given meaning interpretation specified separately distinction would later come called syntax versus semantics
This turned logic eminent computer scientist Allan Newell Herbert Simon called symbol game played meaningless token according certain purely syntactic All meaning purged
One mechanical system various thing could proved
Thus progress first made walking away seemed relevant meaning human symbol
As Bertrand Russell famously quipped Mathematics may defined subject never know talking whether saying Frege work discovery weakness foundation mathematics
For example Euclid considered gold standard logical rigor thousand year turned full logical mistake
Because Euclid used ordinary word like line point century reader deceived making assumption sentence contained word
To give one relatively simple example ordinary usage word line implies given three distinct point line one point must two
But define line using formal logic turn also need Euclid overlooked
Formal logic make gap like easy spot
This realization created foundation mathematics
If bible mathematics contained logical mistake field mathematics
What science like physic built top mathematics
The good news logical method used uncover error could also used correct
Mathematicians started rebuilding foundation mathematics bottom
In Giuseppe Peano axiom arithmetic David Hilbert geometry
Hilbert also outlined program formalize remainder mathematics specific requirement attempt satisfy including Rebuilding mathematics way satisfied requirement became known Hilbert program
Up focus core group logician including Hilbert Russell Kurt Gödel John Von Neumann Alonzo Church course Alan Turing
Hilbert program proceeded least two front
On first front logician created logical system tried prove Hilbert requirement either satisfiable
On second front mathematician used logical concept rebuild classical mathematics
For example Peano system arithmetic start simple function called successor function increase number one
He us successor function recursively define us addition recursively define operation number theory defined
He us definition along formal logic prove theorem arithmetic
The historian Thomas Kuhn observed science novelty emerges Logic era Hilbert program tumultuous process creation destruction
One logician would build elaborate system another would tear
The favored tool destruction construction paradoxical statement showed axiom derived inconsistent
A simple form liar paradox sentence This sentence false
If true false false true leading endless loop
Russell made first notable use liar paradox mathematical logic
He showed Frege system allowed set derived Let set set member
If member definition dictate must contain contains contradicts definition set set member
This became known Russell paradox seen serious flaw Frege achievement
Frege shocked discovery
He replied Russell Your discovery contradiction caused greatest surprise I would almost say consternation since shaken basis I intended build Russell colleague Alfred North Whitehead put forth ambitious attempt complete Hilbert program published three volume The method detailed took page get proof
Russell Whitehead tried resolve Frege paradox introducing called type theory
The idea partition formal language multiple level type
Each level could make reference level higher level
This resolved paradox effect banning
This solution popular logician influence computer science modern computer language feature inspired type theory
paradox ultimately showed Hilbert program could never successful
The first blow came Gödel published famous incompleteness theorem proved consistent logical system powerful enough encompass arithmetic must also contain statement true proven true
Gödel incompleteness theorem one logical result broadly popularized thanks book like came Turing Alonzo Church independently proved algorithm could exist determined whether arbitrary mathematical statement true false
Church inventing entirely different system called would later inspire computer language like
The answer decision problem negative
Turing key insight came first section famous paper On Computable Numbers With Application In order rigorously formulate decision problem Turing first created mathematical model mean computer today machine fit model known universal Turing machine
As logician Martin Davis describes Turing knew algorithm typically specified list rule person follow precise mechanical manner like recipe cookbook
He able show person could limited extremely simple basic action without changing final outcome computation
Then proving machine performing basic action could determine whether given proposed conclusion follows given premise using Frege rule able conclude algorithm exists
As byproduct found mathematical model computing machine
Next Turing showed program could stored inside computer alongside data upon operates
In today vocabulary say invented architecture underlies modern computer Before Turing general supposition dealing machine three category machine program data entirely separate entity
The machine physical object today would call hardware
The program plan computation perhaps embodied punched card connection cable plugboard
Finally data numerical input
Turing universal machine showed distinctness three category illusion
This first rigorous demonstration computing logic could encoded hardware could also encoded software
The architecture Turing described later dubbed Von Neumann architecture modern historian generally agree came Turing apparently Von Neumann
Although technical level Hilbert program failure effort along way demonstrated large swath mathematics could constructed logic
And Shannon Turing connection electronics logic possible export new conceptual machinery computer design
During World War II theoretical work put practice government lab conscripted number elite logician
Von Neumann joined atomic bomb project Los Alamos worked computer design support physic research
In wrote first generally considered definitive source guide modern computer design
secret unit Bletchley Park northwest London helped design computer instrumental breaking German code
His enduring contribution practical computer design specification ACE Automatic Computing Engine
As first computer based Boolean logic architecture ACE EDVAC similar many way
But also interesting difference foreshadowed modern debate computer design
Von Neumann favored design similar modern CISC complex processor baking rich functionality hardware
Turing design like modern RISC reduced processor minimizing hardware complexity pushing work software
Von Neumann thought computer programming would tedious clerical job
Turing contrast said computer programming fascinating
There need real danger ever becoming drudge process quite mechanical may turned machine Since computer programming become significantly sophisticated
One thing changed still primarily consists programmer specifying rule computer follow
In philosophical term say computer programming followed tradition deductive logic branch logic discussed deal manipulation symbol according formal rule
In past decade programming started change growing popularity machine learning involves creating framework machine learn via statistical inference
This brought programming closer main branch logic inductive logic deal inferring rule specific instance
Today promising machine learning technique use neural network first Warren McCulloch Walter Pitts whose idea develop calculus neuron could like Boolean logic used construct computer circuit
Neural network remained esoteric decade later combined statistical technique allowed improve fed data
Recently computer become increasingly adept handling large data set technique produced remarkable result
Programming future likely mean exposing neural network world letting learn
This would fitting second act story computer
Logic began way understand law thought
It helped create machine could reason according rule deductive logic
Today deductive inductive logic combined create machine reason learn
What began Boole word investigation concerning nature constitution human mind could result creation new might someday match even exceed

Glasgow Interactive Systems Group GIST Department Computer Science Glasgow University Glasgow
Tel Fax EMail This paper argues expanding scope science make difficult sustain traditional scientific engineering model research
In particular recent work formal method abandoned traditional empirical method
Similarly research requirement engineering human computer interaction challenged proponent formal method
These tension stem fact Science misnoma
Topics currently considered part discipline computing science technology rather theory driven
This creates problem academic department impose scientific criterion assessment PhDs
It therefore important people ask Research Computing Science starting higher degree
This paper intended high level introduction first year research student student advanced MSc course
It read conjunction research skill computing science
Good research practice suggests begin defining term
The Oxford Concise dictionary defines research However many reason approach unsatisfactory model research
The main objection carry high risk
For example artefact may fail long learn anything conclusion seeking support
Indeed often case approach ignores formation clear hypothesis conclusion artefact built
This may lead artefact become important researcher idea intended establish
The lack clear hypothesis need barrier might seem
The proof demonstration approach much common current engineering practice
Iterative refinement used move implementation gradually towards desired solution
The evidence elicited previous failed attempt used better define goal research work progress
The key problem iterative development artefact turn requires method structure
Engineers need carefully plan way fault found one iteration fed back subsequent development
This typically done testing technique based upon model scientific argument
This close relationship engineering scientific method surprising There many problem standard approach scientific empiricism applied computing science
The principle objection many aspect computing defy use probabilistic measure analysing result empirical test
For example many statistical measure rely upon independence test hypothesis
Such technique clearly used attempting measure performance system attempt optimise performance time rule load balancing algorithm etc
Secondly difficult impose standard experimental condition upon product computer science
For example program behaves one way one set operating condition guarantee behave way another set condition
These condition might go level alpha particle hitting memory chip
Thirdly difficult generalise result tightly controlled empirical experiment
For example user find system easy use evaluation guarantee another user able use product amidst distraction everyday working environment
Finally difficult determine sufficient number trial conducted support many hypothesis
For example attempt prove program always satisfies property almost certainly doomed failure using standard experimental technique The number potential execution path even simple code make impossible test property every possible execution path
The field mathematical reasoning research area right
It however possible identify two different approach use formal proof research technique computing science The first incredible care need made interpretation result mathematical proof
Formal method nothing system argumentation mistake expected
Problems arise mistake difficult detect given complex nature mathematics often used
Recall central feature empirical approach open peer review used check method correct
The second problem formal reasoning scope limited
Interactive time critical system pose specially challenge application mathematics
These issue addressed many problem remain
The third problem relates cost applying formal technique
It take long time acquire necessary skill
Similarly take several month conduct relatively simple proof medium large scale application
Finally argued inadequate discussion failure formal method
Again important recall failure prove hypothesis valuable result empirical technique
Exaggerated claim made formal reasoning typically researcher many claim falsified
As result error application mathematical reasoning seen source shame rather learning opportunity one colleague peer

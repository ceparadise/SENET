A short macroinstruction rule specifies certain input sequence often sequence mapped replacement output sequence also often sequence character according defined procedure
The mapping process instantiates transforms macro use specific sequence known
A facility writing macro may provided part part
In former case macro used make task using application le repetitive
In latter case tool allows programmer enable even design
Macros used make sequence computing instruction available single program statement making programming task le tedious le
Thus called macro big block code expanded small sequence character
Macros often allow positional keyword parameter dictate program generates used create entire program suite according variable factor
The term derives expansion originally used generating code
allow short sequence keystroke mouse action transform usually sequence keystroke mouse action
In way frequently used repetitive sequence keystroke mouse movement
Separate program creating macro called
During macro program originally SuperKey KeyWorks Prokey popular first mean automatically format variety user input task
These program based TSR mode operation applied keyboard input matter context occurred
They extent fallen obsolescence following advent user interface availability keyboard mouse macro application making possible create keyboard macro
Keyboard macro recent time come life method exploiting economy MMORPGs
By tirelessly performing boring repetitive low risk action player running macro earn large amount game currency resource
This effect even larger player operates multiple account simultaneously operates account large amount time day
As money generated without human intervention dramatically upset economy game
For reason use macro violation MMORPGs administrator MMORPGs fight continual war identify punish macro user
Keyboard mouse macro created using application macro feature sometimes called
They created carrying sequence letting application record action
An underlying macro programming language commonly direct access feature application may also exist
The programmer text editor short editing macro follows idea conclusion
In effect editor made macro
Emacs originally devised set macro editing language later ported dialect
Another programmer text editor descendant also full implementation macro
It record register macro person type keyboard replayed edited like macro Microsoft Office
Vim also scripting language called create macro
VBA programming language included Office
However function evolved replaced macro language originally included application
access executes document opened
This make relatively easy write VBA commonly known
In became one common type computer virus
However late date patching updating program
In addition current program immediately counteract attack
Languages rudimentary macro system implemented compiler assembler
macro work simple textual token rather character level
A classic use macro computer typesetting system derivative functionality based macro
experimental system seek reconcile macro system
typed syntax macro one productive way think syntax macro
Other example Some language embedded text source code language
The mechanism code fragment recognised instance bracketed similar textual macro language much powerful fully featured language
Macros language written subset compiler executes statement compilation time output execution form part code compiled
The ability use familiar macro language give power much greater text substitution macro expense larger slower compiler
frame macro command syntax also contain text language
Each frame generic component hierarchy nested subassemblies procedure integrating subassembly frame recursive process resolve integration conflict favor higher level subassemblies
The output custom document typically compilable source module
Frame technology avoid proliferation similar subtly different component issue plagued software development since invention macro subroutine
Most assembly language le powerful procedural macro facility example allowing block code repeated N time completely different syntax actual assembly language
Macro C preprocessor described work level lexical token preserve lexical structure reliably
Syntactic macro system work instead level preserve lexical structure original program
The widely used implementation syntactic macro system found language
These language especially suited style macro due uniform parenthesized syntax known
In particular uniform syntax make easier determine invocation macro
Lisp macro transform program structure full language available express transformation
While syntactic macro often found language also available language
They also available extension

Before Lisp macro operator whose input value computed argument rather syntactic form argument whose output value used computation
In word FEXPRs implemented level EVAL provided window layer
This generally found difficult model reason effectively
In Timothy Hart proposed adding macro Lisp AI Memo MACRO Definitions LISP
In number paper introduced notion expansion system syntactic environment macro definition macro use distinct allowing macro definers user worry inadvertent variable capture cf

Hygienic macro standardized Scheme standard
The upcoming standard also include hygienic macro
A number competing implementation hygienic macro exist explicit renaming syntactic closure
Both standardized Scheme standard
Recently combined notion hygienic macro syntactic expansion time one macro system ordinary runtime another block code showed apply interleaved expansion parsing language
A number language Scheme either implement hygienic macro implement partially hygienic system
Examples include
conjecture three category make primary legitimate us macro system
Others proposed alternative us macro macro system unhygienic allow selective unhygienic transformation
The interaction macro language feature productive area research
For example useful programming interaction macro construct must defined use together
Module interact macro proposed Scheme language macro
For example language extends notion macro system syntactic tower macro written language including macro using hygiene ensure syntactic layer distinct allowing module export macro module
Macros normally used map short string macro invocation longer sequence instruction
Another le common use macro reverse map sequence instruction macro string
This approach taken Mobile Programming System used rudimentary macro compiler called SIMCMP map specific instruction set given computer counterpart macro
Applications notably compiler written macro run without change computer equipped rudimentary macro compiler
The first application run context sophisticated powerful macro compiler written macro language
This macro compiler applied fashion produce compiled much efficient version
The advantage approach complex application ported one computer different computer little effort target machine architecture writing rudimentary macro compiler
The advent modern programming language notably compiler available virtually computer rendered approach superfluous
This however one first instance first

In reference computer stand macroinstruction programmable pattern translates certain sequence preset sequence
used make task le repetitive representing complicated sequence movement command type input
In computer programming tool allow developer code
For instance example simple definition incorporates define square x x x After defined like macro used code body find square number
When code preprocessed macro expanded time occurs
For instance using macro like int num square writing int num declare named set value
Note function require special instruction computational overhead safely pas argument return value macro way repeat line code
In simple case using macro instead function improve performance requiring fewer instruction system resource execute

A also document specifies function system component must perform often part requirement specification
The documentation typically describes needed system user well requested property input output
system
A functional specification technical response matching requirement document
PRD
Thus pick result stage
On complex system multiple level functional specification typically nest
system level module level level technical detail
A specification define inner working proposed system include specification system function implemented
Instead focus various outside agent people using program computer peripheral computer example might observe interacting system
A functional requirement functional specification might state follows Such requirement describes interaction external agent software system
When user provides input system clicking OK button program responds respond closing dialog window containing OK button
There many purpose functional specification
One primary purpose team project achieve form team consensus program achieve making effort writing followed period
Typically consensus reached one review project hand negotiated way achieve requirement software need fulfill
In ordered industrial software engineering functional specification describes implemented
The next document describes function realized using chosen software environment
In non industrial prototypical system development functional specification typically written part
When team agrees functional specification consensus reached functional spec typically declared complete signed
After typically software development testing team write source code test case using functional specification reference
While testing performed behavior program compared expected behavior defined functional specification
One popular method writing functional specification document involves drawing rendering either simple wireframes accurate graphically designed UI screenshots
After completed screen example approved stakeholder graphical element numbered written instruction added number screen example
For example login screen username field labeled password field labeled number declared writing use software engineer later beta testing purpose ensure functionality intended
The benefit method countless additional detail attached screen example

In mathematically based technique whose purpose help implementation system software
They used describe system analyze behavior aid design verifying key property interest rigorous effective reasoning tool
These specification sense syntax semantics fall within one domain able used infer useful information
In passing decade computer system become increasingly powerful result become impactful society
Because better technique needed assist design implementation reliable software
Established engineering discipline use mathematical analysis foundation creating validating product design
Formal specification one way achieve software engineering reliability predicted
Other method commonly used enhance code quality
Given possible use technique demonstrate system design correct respect specification
This allows incorrect system design revised major investment made actual implementation
Another approach use probably correct step transform specification design ultimately transformed implementation
It important note formal specification implementation rather may used develop
Formal specification describe system system
A good specification must following attribute adequate internally consistent unambiguous complete satisfied minimal A good specification One main reason interest formal specification provide ability perform proof software implementation
These proof may used validate specification verify correctness design prove program satisfies specification
A design implementation ever declared correct
It ever correct respect given specification
Whether formal specification correctly describes problem solved separate issue
It also difficult issue address since ultimately concern problem constructing abstracted formal representation informal concrete abstraction step amenable formal proof
However possible specification proving challenge concerning property specification expected exhibit
If correct theorem reinforce specifier understanding specification relationship underlying problem domain
If specification probably need changed better reflect domain understanding involved producing implementing specification
Formal method software development widely used industry
Most company consider apply software development process
This may variety reason Other limitation Formal specification technique existed various domain various scale quite time
Implementations formal specification differ depending kind system attempting model applied point software life cycle introduced
These type model categorized following specification paradigm In addition paradigm way apply certain heuristic help improve creation specification
The paper referenced best discus heuristic use designing specification
They applying approach
The example leading formal
Others include Specification Language AMN
In area formal specification often used describe property Web service
Some tool For implementation example refer link section

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Functional Specification available

A functional specification FS formal document detail feature specification certain software product
During requirement phase software development process functional specification one key document created manager lead developer
Hence functional specification contain enough detail developer begin design project thereafter begin coding
A functional specification also known functional design specification
The method preparing specification product known writing manual first serf outline finished program
The functional specification list user task description product comparison external interface compatible hardware software framework version operating system
The scope functional specification limited following There number plan document reference functional specification
Some key document guided functional specification The functional specification typically need evolve development software product progress
It may impossible specify detail time project initiated
For example may impossible define screen format interactive program requirement phase

Difference requirement context designing software system
Give example case
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Let elaborate
An example would A related system may The functional requirement relates system functionality
The requirement system
Typically requirement fall area A complete list available Wikipedia entry
requirement sometimes defined term metric something measured system make tangible
requirement may also describe aspect system relate execution rather evolution time
maintainability extensibility documentation etc
functional requirement main thing user expects software example application banking application application able create new account update account delete account etc
functional requirement detailed specified system design acquirement straight forward requirement system rather related usability way example banking application major requirement availability application available time possible
Functional requirement specifies function system system component must able perform
It documented various way
The common one written description document use case
Use case textual enumeration list well diagram describing user action
Each use case illustrates behavioural scenario one functional requirement
Often though analyst begin eliciting set use case analyst derive functional requirement must implemented allow user perform use case
Functional requirement system
It may A typical functional requirement contain unique name number brief summary rationale
This information used help reader understand requirement needed track requirement development system
already explained requirement
I add
requirement requirement functional requirement
This requirement specifies criterion used
requirement form overall property system whole particular aspect specific function
The system overall property commonly mark difference whether development project succeeded failed
requirement divided two main category Whether requirement expressed functional requirement may depend Ex
A system may required present user display number record database
This functional requirement
How update number need requirement
If number need updated real time system architect must ensure system capable updating displayed record count within acceptably short interval number record changing
References activity system must perform Functional requirement related technical functionality system
requirement requirement specifies criterion used judge operation system particular condition rather specific behavior
For example consider shopping site adding item cart browsing different item applying offer deal successfully placing order come functional requirement
Where performance system peak hour time taken system retrieve data DB security user data ability system handle large number user login come non functional requirement
I think client developer side regarding functionality user software developer client
requirement given client provided developer run system smoothly
safety security flexibility scalability availability etc

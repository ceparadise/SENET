To make learning list important computer science theory concept explained analogy minimal technical term
It like computer science degree program everyone get understand general concept
Important note Also check getting started programming
Say order Amazon download film collection online time
You want test method faster
The delivery take almost day arrive download completed minute earlier
Great
So tight race
For online shopping number purchased item input affect delivery time
The output constant
We call
For online downloading download time directly proportional movie file size input
We call
From experiment know online shopping scale better online downloading
It important understand big O notation help analyze algorithm
Big O notation represents algorithm
Let assume O O n scenario example
Someone movie theater asks row sitting
You lazy count ask person front
You simply add person answer get current row number
Brilliant right
However person front exactly thing
Finally question reach row answer I row
From correct message incremented one row pas way person asked
Here another example known
A nurse carrying tray box cocoa cup containing smaller image holding thing turn contains even smaller version image
Here
If still get recursion Otherwise continue reading
Let assume leak water pipe garden
You take bucket sealing material fix problem
After see leak much bigger need plumber bring bigger tool
In meanwhile still using bucket drain water
After notice massive underground stream opened
You need handle gallon water every second
Buckets useful anymore
You need completely new approach solve problem volume velocity water grown
To prevent town flooding may need government build massive dam requires enormous civil engineering expertise elaborate control system
Big data describes data set large complex impossible manage conventional data processing tool
Every computer scientist programmer least know Imagine going hiking goal reach highest peak possible
You already map start thousand possible path shown map
You lazy simply time evaluate
Screw map
You started hiking simple strategy greedy
Just take path
After trip ended whole body sore tired look hiking map first time
Oh god
There muddy river I crossed instead keep walking upwards
A greedy algorithm pick never reconsiders choice
This time climbing another hill
You determined find path lead highest peak
However map provided foggy
To make trip easier downloaded hiking app track path taken measure current altitude
You climb hill
Each time take exact path lead highest peak ever recorded somewhere choose
You also randomly choose different starting point known
So linger around area reduce probability getting stuck
The hill climbing algorithm attempt find better solution generating
Each neighboring solution generated based best solution far
It Mount Everest biggest challenge ever faced
Your goal reach summit impractical climb Mount Everest
You one chance
You cautious
Instead always climbing upwards reducing chance taking wrong path
The higher climb lower probability move lower point explore
The example describes yes memoization memorization approach dynamic programming store result previous computation future use
Pararth Shah wrote brilliant analogy long included
P v NP one popular important unsolved problem computer science field
Say I give multiplication question like x The answer
Easy solve right
What I reverse question x To solve assuming seen probably go possible number
We find easily
What I ask Could possibly
You answer right
Just divide
Multiplication easy
Finding original factor number hard
So P polynomial problem
Computer easily multiply super large number without spending significantly computer time small number
NP nondeterministic polynomial problem
Finding factor still fairly easy computer solve number
It impossible computer right
Here important part Are NP problem factorization also P problem multiplication discover efficient way solve NP problem
Are NP problem really hard solve need aha moment brilliant scientist
come efficient algorithm
Or maybe human dumb
Imagine exist machine life posse
They see u like see ant
Our level intelligence insignificant
Solving P v NP problem like solving
So P v NP problem important
If able prove mean solved easily within reasonable computer time
We able cure cancer break password etc
It
P v NP listed Clay Mathematics Institute
million awarded first correct solution

When drive car necessarily understand car engine work
The complex detail hidden
So computer turn binary code program
Here excellent video us domino visualize computer perform binary calculation basic fundamental level huge topic includes subfields like
Let say work secretary company A
You answer phone call arrange meeting typing document etc
You always task based priority
Every time phone ring stop whatever task working
Concurrency property program system allow task run time period
Eventually cope job much data entry task
You complain bos happily hire data entry clerk handle data entry task
Parallelism allows task run time provided machine capability
However implementation concurrency concept also introduces potential problem race condition
This happen allow concurrent transaction banking system race condition handled So handle situation
One really simple way mutual exclusion
Now whenever ongoing transaction system lock account involved transaction
This time moment transaction A occurs account locked
You withdraw money ATM
It unlocks transaction A completes
So mutual exclusion solves problem right
Yes nobody want get rejected ATM every time ongoing transaction
Let modify solution little bit
Now let set different priority level different type transaction
Say cash withdrawal request higher priority bank transfer
When withdraw money ATM transaction A bank transfer stop allow transaction B carry first higher priority
It resume transaction B completed
Binary semaphore simple
ongoing transaction
waiting
On hand counting semaphore allows process running time
Let say locker room manager spa
There locker
You keep track number key time receive hand key exactly know
If locker full others queue
Whenever someone done hand key first person queue
Deadlock another common issue concurrency system
Let use banking system analogy different scenario
Just keep mind access bank account locked whenever ongoing transaction
However since transaction completed access locked account
Both wait complete
Deadlock
Here real life example Let approach first
Let approach first
Hacking similar breaking house
Here popular hacking technique Try hundred thousand different key
An experienced burglar try commonly used key first
A attack usually start guessing commonly used password like abcdef etc
A couple moved next door
They really nice helpful
They often invite dinner
One day mentioned going vacation soon
They happily offered take care dog
You left spare key
Since heard news
Social engineering revealing private information
A burglar check every possible entry find easiest way weakness get
Maybe window left open know
A burglar pretend plumber unlock door
He fix leaking pipe everything look perfectly normal
After left discovered jewelry missing
A trojan horse malware program useful helpful run malicious code
Your door lock jammed call locksmith
He fix door lock secretly duplicate another key
A rootkit gain computer various way like social engineering disguise necessary file hard detect antivirus software
Here bookshop analogy
Imagine people visit little bookshop time
Your bookshop occupied others come
You ask leave seem coming group
They probably know
Most seem genuinely interested buy book
Some even ask book shelved
Someone counter pay penny
People keep coming hour
All look perfectly normal
At end day made one book sale
Remember guy pay penny
DDoS attempt bring site service visitor
Cryptography study application secure communication
Here widely used cryptographic protocol Say Alice Bob want send stuff
To make sure nobody see stuff lock box
They make identical symmetric key lock meet share key beforehand
Sharing identical key work fine among people
What Alice want exchange stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff
Alice use lock key shared Bob else Bob unlock box easily
Of course Alice share completely new different lock key Carl Alice want exchange stuff different people
She need keep manage different key
So Alice come brilliant solution
Now maintains key private key
She distribute padlock public key friend
Anyone close padlock encrypt key open decrypt
Now anyone send stuff Alice using padlock distributed Alice longer manage different key different people
If Alice want send something Carl ask Carl padlock public key use lock encrypt stuff send Carl
The basic principle everyone private key decrypt message provide sender public key message encryption
Read Also You figure need document requirement
Like waterfall way go back unless start
You move next phase current phase completed
You figure thing need beginning
Then continuously improve evolve collaborate adapt development go
Here popular implementation agile development methodology So graduated
You write good beautiful code hopefully everything perfect far
Let introduce software development methodology taught college
Next wonder suck estimating development time And methodology often implemented wrongly So go
Computer science nutshell
Feel free suggest new computer science theory concept add think important often confusing
Computer scientist like physicist programmer like engineer
Writing specific instruction dumb yet obedient machine
What mean
Imagine teach kid shower
The kid know follow instruction
So ask kid Oh wait The kid even remove clothes entering shower
That computer work
You tell computer exactly need
It know assume never think consequence
Getting zone like falling asleep
Imagine waking person close falling asleep second
Now spend time fall back sleep
They related
Java Javascript similar like car carpet similar
JQuery library built top JavaScript
Javascript ugly nerd jQuery wizard turn handsome quarterback
You call library
Framework call
A library tool
A framework way life
It impossible tell
The number even negative developer paying
Measuring software productivity line code like measuring progress airplane much weighs
Objects noun method verb
Objects like people
They living breathing thing knowledge inside thing memory inside remember thing
And rather interacting interact high level abstraction like right
Here example If I laundry object give dirty clothes send message say Can get clothes laundered I happen know best laundry place San Francisco
And I speak English I dollar pocket
So I go hail taxicab tell driver take place San Francisco
I go get clothes laundered I jump back cab I get back
I give clean clothes say Here clean You idea I
You knowledge laundry place
Maybe speak French even hail taxi
You pay one dollar pocket
Yet I knew
And know
All complexity hidden inside able interact high level abstraction
That object
They encapsulate complexity interface complexity high level
At restaurant order food call API menu APIs
Once food ready API response ready waiter serve food
The basic idea ask want system return response without exposing happening behind scene
NoSQL database store information like would recipe book
When want know make cake go recipe information make cake ingredient preparation mixing baking finishing etc
one page
SQL like shopping ingredient recipe
In order get ingredient cart go many different aisle get ingredient
When done shopping grocery cart full ingredient run around collect
Wouldn nicer store organized recipe could go one place store grab everything need one spot
Granted find ingredient like egg different place bit overhead stocking shelf consumer standpoint much find looking

This goooooood
Thanks Yash
I actually adding theory right improving explanation stay tuned
Keep posted Very helpful analogy
However Asymmetric cryptography section I think Alice realize brilliant thought find solve initial problem sending stuff Carl people
You mean part distribute padlock friend
The thing asymmetric cryptography eliminates need managing different key different people
Alice need keep one key distributes padlock duplicating
I meant earlier part first paragraph
From I understand Carl send stuff Alice great still leaf Alice unable send stuff Carl Carl lock going help open package Alice original problem
The original problem number key person increase number friend increase
You right Alice send stuff Carl Carl easily send lock Alice Carl need manage single key
The basic idea everyone need manage one private key broadcast public key anyone
If case You remove line What Alice want send stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff I happy
You could also change problem If Alice could receive stuff want maintain separate everybody problem would make sense
Updated
Thanks lot pointing mistake
You welcome
Thank helpful post
Incredibly good post
This give analogy I would never thought otherwise I use advising client
Thanks

That really good post learn concept remember
As request could add Actor model Concurrency point Noted
Will consider add
I Javascript jQuery example
How Javascript ugly nerd jQuery wizard turn handsome quarterback This good added article
That really dynamic programming
Your description really caching
Maybe functional language caching
The analogy indeed memoization approach I updated section avoid confusion
Thanks pointing
What analogy article describes regard nosql actually denormalisation
An analogy nosql would telling taxi driver route travel instead list location arrive
The taxi driver spend much time looking map assuming satnav
Don really get analogy mind elaborate
More More By way tnx Dude
Since im beginner computer help lot
Tnx Man No problem Edwin
yeah enthusiastic analogy
kind rude really tell except jquery nicer look
otherwise great post thanks
I removed analogy sorry offended
appreciate
think really valuable post thanks work writing compiling
I teacher thankfull core heart You welcome Sabeeh
Your section P NP incorrect misleading
Specifically defined membership NP easy verify hard solve
The qualification needed NP part problem easy verify
Hard solve precludes P otherwise affect NP way
Also kind nitpicking impossible reasonable amount say uncomputable
Thank
A small list top would make great reference Will add ASAP
Yes like table content easier navigation
Thank though thorough explanation
hiiii india simply Hats ur effort
Thanks Swarup
I hope mind I shared Facebook group I member aim help educate science science communication
It called Science Media also aim help teach tool skepticism
I hoping member enjoy
Thank sharing
Of course I mind
It meant help many people possible
I Professor Computer Science I bet best giving real world analogy explain complex CS concept ton This great thank much
Some really Layamn term
For example text data structure redirects Wikipedia
And Wikipedia horrible source people
It sometimes horrible even technical people tends show simple thing complicated way
It fact time make new Wiki try show thing simple possible simpler paraphrase old Chinese proverb
I LOVING
Learning ton
Thanks
One first analogy say What I order several I believe mean What I order several movie collection one
Even original Harry Potter example still several movie
Thanks
As student IT I MUST thank deeply
Really thanks lot
hacking mean cracking Hi carl
The p v np analogy easy solve factoring
Simply find square root divide every number le reach find factor
So instead going test
Obviously know rule factoring divisible number check
odd possibility
No check
And rule factoring multiple sum multiple
The sum multiple
So number test
Hope help
Pay million
This awesomely great Carl

lot
This cool article
May I translate article Chinese
This excellent
I appreciate compiling creating sharing well
It fantastic resource I know help student educator
Plus made laugh loud
It cool helpful
First year Comp Sci student I say explanation would gone much better programming class professor used

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

In chemistry physic phase physically distinctive form plasma
characterized relatively uniform chemical physical property
Phases different
phase exist different phase yet
For example exist multiple phase oil phase aqueous phase
The term phase may also used describe equilibrium state phase diagram
When phase used context synonymous state matter quality describe phase include organization matter well variable temperature pressure
The distinct phase used describe state matter include But may multiple phase within single state matter
For example bar solid iron may contain multiple phase martensite austenite
An oil water mixture liquid separate two phase
At equilibrium narrow space two phase matter exhibit property either phase
This region may thin yet exert significant effect

In technique arranging complexity computer system
It work establishing level complexity person interacts system suppressing complex detail current level
The programmer work idealized interface usually well defined add additional level functionality would otherwise complex handle
For example programmer writing code involves numerical operation may interested way number represented underlying hardware
whether detail suppressed said leaving simply programmer work
In addition task sending email message across continent would extremely complex programmer start piece fiber optic cable basic hardware component
By using layer complexity created abstract away physical cable network layout presenting programmer virtual data channel task manageable
Abstraction apply control data abstraction action
The notion programming viewed way combine abstraction data code
The abstract definition used common family object different implementation behavior share meaning
The mechanism programming used define common interface
The recommendation programmer use abstraction whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually known
The requirement programming language provide suitable abstraction also called abstraction principle
Computing mostly operates independently concrete world The hardware implement interchangeable others
The software structured enable human create enormous system concentrating issue time
These architecture made specific choice abstraction
architecture inevitable complex
A central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial language developed express specific aspect system
help planning
processed computer
An example abstraction process generational development
Each stage used stepping stone next stage
The language abstraction continues example
Within programming language feature let programmer create new abstraction
These include
Some abstraction remain invisible operate design system
Some abstraction try limit range concept programmer need aware completely hiding abstraction turn built
The software engineer writer criticised effort claiming abstraction never completely hide detail however negate usefulness abstraction
Some abstraction designed interoperate abstraction example programming language may contain making call language
Different programming language provide different type abstraction depending intended application language
For example Analysts developed various method formally specify software system
Some known method include Specification language generally rely abstraction one kind another since specification typically defined earlier project abstract level eventual implementation
The specification language example allows definition class waterfall project remain abstract architecture specification phase project
Programming language offer control abstraction one main purpose use
Computer machine understand operation low level moving bit one location memory another location producing sum two sequence bit
Programming language allow done higher level
For example consider statement written fashion To human seems fairly simple obvious calculation
However step necessary carry evaluation return value assign value variable actually quite subtle complex
The value need converted binary representation often much complicated task one would think calculation decomposed compiler interpreter assembly instruction much le intuitive programmer operation shifting binary register left adding binary complement content one register another simply human think abstract arithmetical operation addition multiplication
Finally assigning resulting value variable labeled used later involves additional step looking variable label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation memory location etc
Without control abstraction programmer would need specify step time simply wanted add multiply couple number assign result variable
Such duplication effort two serious negative consequence Structured programming involves splitting complex program task smaller piece clear interface component reduction complexity potential
In simple program may aim ensure loop single obvious exit point possible single exit point function procedure
In larger system may involve breaking complex task many different module
Consider system handle payroll ship shore office These layer produce effect isolating implementation detail one component assorted internal method others
programming embrace extends concept
Data abstraction enforces clear separation property detail implementation
The abstract property visible client code make use data data concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed change example incorporate efficiency improvement time
The idea change supposed impact client code since involve difference abstract behaviour
For example one could define called uniquely associate value may retrieved specifying corresponding key
Such lookup table may implemented various way even simple linear key value pair
As far client code concerned abstract property type case
Of course relies getting detail interface right first place since change major impact client code
As one way look interface form agreed behaviour data type client code anything spelled contract subject change without notice
In theory involves facility define object represent abstract actor perform work report change state communicate object system
The term refers hiding detail extending concept earlier programming language associate strongly data standardizing way different data type interact beginning
When abstraction proceeds operation defined enabling object different type substituted called
When proceeds opposite direction inside type class structuring simplify complex set relationship called
Various programming language offer similar facility abstraction support general strategy programming includes substitution one another similar role
Although generally supported image package may predetermine great many
This would leave minimum binding change
example feature le distinction use delegation
Individual object function abstracted flexibly better fit shared functional heritage
exemplifies another extreme relies heavily static binding turn certain flexibility problem
Although example offer alternate strategy achieving abstraction fundamentally alter need support abstract noun code programming relies ability abstract verb function noun data structure either process
Consider example sample fragment represent common farm animal level abstraction suitable model simple aspect hunger feeding
It defines class represent state animal function With definition one could create object type call method like In example class abstraction used place actual animal abstraction case generalisation
If one requires differentiated hierarchy animal differentiate say provide milk provide nothing except meat end life intermediary level abstraction probably DairyAnimal cow goat would eat food suitable giving good milk MeatAnimal pig steer would eat food give best
Such abstraction could remove need application coder specify type food could concentrate instead feeding schedule
The two class could related using stand alone programmer could define varying degree two type
These facility tend vary drastically language general achieve anything possible others
A great many operation overload data type data type effect degree inheritance mean achieve polymorphism
The class notation simply coder convenience
Decisions regarding abstract keep control coder become major concern design determining relevant relationship real world concern
In general determine appropriate abstraction one must make many small decision scope domain analysis determine system one must cooperate legacy analysis perform detailed analysis expressed within project time budget constraint design
In simple example domain barnyard live pig cow eating habit legacy constraint detailed analysis coder must flexibility feed animal available thus reason code type food class design single simple Animal class pig cow instance function
A decision differentiate DairyAnimal would change detailed analysis domain legacy analysis would entirely control programmer refer abstraction programming distinct abstraction domain legacy analysis
When discussing refers act considering le detailed safe definition observed program behavior
For instance one may observe final result program execution instead considering intermediate step execution
Abstraction defined precise model execution
Abstraction may respect property one answer question property equally well concrete abstract model
For instance wish know result evaluation mathematical expression involving integer worth need perform operation modulo familiar form abstraction
Abstractions however though necessarily
That possible get sound answer though abstraction may simply yield result
For instance may abstract student class minimal maximal age one asks whether certain person belongs class one may simply compare person age minimal maximal age age lie outside range one may safely answer person belong class one may answer I know
The level abstraction included programming language influence overall
The framework includes concept formalism
This framework allows designer programming language study abstraction characteristic design change abstraction influence language usability
Abstractions prove useful dealing computer program property computer program essentially see
As consequence automatic method deriving information behavior computer program either drop termination occasion may fail crash never yield result soundness may provide false information precision may answer I know question
Abstraction core concept
generally take place abstract version studied system
Computer science commonly present le commonly abstraction wherein level represents different model information process varying amount detail
Each level us system expression involving unique set object composition apply particular domain
Each relatively abstract higher level build relatively concrete lower level tends provide increasingly granular representation
For example gate build electronic circuit binary gate machine language binary programming language machine language application operating system programming language
Each level embodied determined level beneath making language description somewhat
Since many user database system lack familiarity computer database developer often hide complexity following level The lowest level abstraction describes system actually store data
The physical level describes complex data structure detail
The next higher level abstraction describes data database store relationship exist among data
The logical level thus describes entire database term small number relatively simple structure
Although implementation simple structure logical level may involve complex physical level structure user logical level need aware complexity
This referred
must decide information keep database use logical level abstraction
The highest level abstraction describes part entire database
Even though logical level us simpler structure complexity remains variety information stored large database
Many user database system need information instead need access part database
The view level abstraction exists simplify interaction system
The system may provide many database
The ability provide different level abstraction use
Some specifically generate design contain various level abstraction
Layered architecture partition concern application stacked group layer
It technique used designing computer software hardware communication system network component isolated layer change made one layer without affecting others

A proof concept POC demonstration purpose verify certain concept theory potential application
POC therefore prototype designed determine feasibility represent deliverable
Proof concept also known proof principle
Proof concept term various interpretation different area
POC software development describes distinct process different objective participant role
POC may also refer partial solution involving small number user acting business role establish whether system satisfies certain requirement
The overall objective POC find solution technical problem system integrated throughput achieved given configuration
In business world POC startup demonstrate product financially viable
POC involves extensive research review submitted single package concerned party
It includes examination revenue model company show projected revenue product service indicate development cost finance projection much service cost maintain market
It excellent way business evaluate internally proposed acquisition project

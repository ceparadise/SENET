Assistive Technology Computer Science Blaise Liffick Department Computer Science Millersville University Millersville PA USA The purpose paper demonstrate assistive technology incorporated computer science valid method demonstrating basic computer science principle interaction method social legal ethical issue computing
One earliest depiction assistive technology popular entertainment original pilot show TV series later incorporated episode The Menagerie
In first captain Enterprise Christopher Pike suffered injury crippling control body whatsoever although cognitive ability entirely intact
He communicate solely combination light tone signal flash briefly
He unexplained reason limited two response one flash yes two flash
In show written even much assistive technology obviously considered science fiction
We clearly progressed well beyond simple output mechanism technique scanning Captain Pike could certainly communicated fully scanning alphabet since clearly could operate single switch
However input side clear whether even point time match depiction since Pike control voluntary muscle whatsoever
Apparently device controlled entirely mentally
While researcher success technique exactly method still largely realm science fiction nearly year depiction
This paper describes project develop curriculum introduce intricacy assistive technology computer science major
The purpose involve computer professional vital element support person disability
For purpose paper term assistive technology AT limited describing computer hardware software used increase maintain improve functional capability individual disability
Although legally speaking AT typically much broader definition includes instance mechanical device standard wheelchair walker foam support arranging posture etc
focus paper clearly computerized aspect area
Nearly population America disabled half number classified The main area disability typically categorized include vision impairment mobility impairment hearing impairment speech impairment cognitive disability
Approximately disabled student graduate high school America year American college student disabled
As life expectancy continues increase disabled population large number continue grow
Furthermore law Americans Disabilities Act place significant requirement employer educator industry provide reasonable accommodation assist disabled
Assistive technology increasingly available either help compensate disability provide accessibility information service general improve quality life disabled
Computer scientist specifically interaction HCI professional expertise developing evaluating device usability perspective
However currently expertise seldom directed AT field
As consequence many AT device poorly designed usability perspective resulting extensive training need poor utilization client abandonment AT user
This exacerbated frequent poor matching device person disability poorly trained AT service provider
Finally complexity many AT device often impediment potential user requiring extensive computing experience fully take advantage feature
Those often called upon provide service assistive technology also typically prepared complexity myriad computerized device
This lack skill due number factor
To begin degree program person entering field necessity general approach disabled population
For instance occupational therapy program Masters program University Pittsburgh typically focus fundamental human anatomy biomechanics neurology cognitive psychology working within health care system often without single course assistive technology
Even specialized professional degree program pathology special education little room curriculum cursory introduction assistive technology
A number certificate program created recent year bridge gap formal education practice example California State University Northridge Center Disabilities Assistive Technology Applications Certificate Program Certificate Accessible Information Technology offered Project EASI still far AT service professional significant computing background
Another issue understanding intricacy AT device requires level computer sophistication much higher provide primary service disabled typically
While many device
joystick simple install configure real difficulty computer AT device often something go wrong
A recent email posted AT listserv desperate service provider illustrates In addition potentially providing direct support person disability increasing need computer professional familiar assistive technology least two domain support company employee disability require accommodation support client customer employer may require access company information service product ensuring company product meet requirement accessibility
As employee client consumer demand accommodation need evaluate recommend install configure provide training maintain addition research design assistive device likewise increase
These task require support person highly skilled computer technology
While assistive technology requires skill computer science college degree many device require extensive configuring installation companion computer system
In case augmentative communication device device special purpose computer command structure interface programming environment requires extensive skill set use maintain
Assistive technology obvious intersection many issue classic interaction topic
Surprisingly however HCI textbook contain cursory look AT

In survey widely used HCI textbook two book contain sufficient mention disability issue warrant reference book index total page coverage topic book combined page
The situation better conference circuit conference Association Computing Machinery ACM Special Interest Group Interaction SIGCHI Conference regularly includes research paper dealing assistive technology
There also relatively new conference devoted accessibility issue International Conference Universal Access Interaction
And ACM SIGCAPH group hosting successful ASSETS conference many year although SIGCAPH danger disbanding due low membership
However lack textbook support HCI course cover assistive technology regular part content
There numerous way assistive technology could used example project topic within HCI curriculum without sacrificing core content course
Some typical HCI topic associated AT topic include For example I describe experiment developed class project HCI course
While large part goal assignment teach student difference scientific experiment usability study significant element project take account factor related disability case blindness fact intent experiment compare performance blind user sighted user
As discussed one motivation described project create assignment outside student typical experience could anticipate It seems often student rely assumption based skill facing decision good bad design especially evaluating easy hard interface use
By incorporating example assignment related assistive technology bias largely removed
AT used applied example many classic area computer science including For example recent paper Steriadis Constantinou clearly aimed HCI segment computer science also contains element would home discussed CS course
For instance author use finite automaton describe behavior certain input device state transition tree describing encoding particular method interaction
These element could provide powerful example within course automaton introduced
In addition since extensive discussion hardware element input device
button simple switch switch automatically repeat process paper could also useful within architecture course
Finally author discus selection specific programming language development system would useful comparative language course
The study AT computer science could also used help satisfy recommendation requirement professional association accrediting agency curriculum area social legal ethical issue computing
Both Association Computing Machinery curriculum model ABET Computing Accreditation Commission requirement contain specification including topic area
Discussions impact introduction AT device life disabled difficulty device acceptance complexity working within health care system secure funding device excellent example incorporating social ethical issue computer science curriculum
And America elsewhere world numerous law require employer service provider provide accommodation disability
It easy demonstrate assistive technology subset HCI field
However HCI slow incorporate AT directly within domain least curriculum perspective
As result HCI textbook course include anything cursory mention AT
Within computer science whole even le attention paid AT issue
However demonstrated discussion AT device technique used valid example number curricular area considered core computer science
It intent project develop specific curriculum make possible faculty include AT topic within course excellent application example computer science principle
The intent effort provide computer science major sufficient background provide basic computer AT support service people disability encourage computer professional become involved future research development innovative device technique aid population

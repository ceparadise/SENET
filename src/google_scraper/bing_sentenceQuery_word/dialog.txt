I American I always thought difference one meaning way entry found According mean conversation mean window computer screen
This I
However least people
So question I guess The real justification seeing American many word US spelling seems logical British largely thanks Webster though far I know never addressed particular issue
Paraphrasing entry another word list commonplace AmE text Webster often get credit change played direct part
There many written instance prior rapid uptake writer one might reasonably suppose author perfectly literate
I think people involved technical writing inclined ignore precedent go seems logical spelling
Consequently see short form much often computer context leading many people suppose fact two different word involved least word two different spelling dependent context
It seems usage currently transition phase likely shorter form continue encroach traditional context eventually seen standard context people particularly Brits happened yet
I surprised discover Americans indeed use spelling talking conversation
Using American English corpus I search dialog word sequence would used sense conversation wo match dialog box
The graph British English corpus similar appearance
Historical data useful new concept like dialogue box
What see British people use usually making concession American reader
For worth British spellchecker recognise
page note The distinction hard fast
The spelling acceptable common American English become US norm uncommon still preferred
Searching bear appears print almost frequently US text
The Unabridged version simply list variant
I seen used user interface specification
I suspect favored specification especially simply couple character shorter
As might suspect UK text use referring dialog box
Also note ZDNet UK tech podcast called
To title question semantic difference mean conversation
Specifically box v box latter rare
To specific question As one people named Dialogue Box video podcast programmer writer thirty year I like confirm thinking went
As far concerned like AmE usage like BrE
The main UK usage AmE spelling IT long time dominated US software Windows C Unix Pascal et al
As US spelling commonplace literature encoded grammar syntax programming language operating system used context practical exclusion BrE alternative since point
So Dialog Box would use example phrase outside IT
However two u video British going element interaction viewer reader
Users
although never transpired
So decided go considered mild neologism
Since early computer software especially Operating Systems like Unix Linux Windows etc developed people working US though Americans much literature referring Computer system software spelling British English
Since documentation even research still dominated American academia industry atleast volume spelling persisted part world whether formally respected
The first second edition series list acceptable spelling word
But Also
A written composition representing two person conversing reasoning Plato
A conversation two
The label spelling short
Spellings identified label reflected effort United States Britain simplify rationalize perhaps I say rashonalize English orthography
Unlike predecessor included Reformed Spelling recommendation alternative spelling entry word SSB SSS allied organization wanted change
But entry word already two spelling independent effort spelling simplifiers dictionary use label Thus entry catalogue look like Also
And entry simplifiers whose simplified form evidently gain without option
Thus A dramatic part composition single performer
The preface introduction discourse poem performance prologue Chaucer Canterbury Tales
I poking around could find variant spelling labeled though I sure must others dictionary appears unusual case variant spelling arguably primarily attributable early spelling reform movement
Noah Webster hand died
The label appears next Fourth Collegiate vanishes offer simpler presentation primary spelling variant Also
The recent dictionary Collegiate series retains essentially opening wording entry term written composition two character represented conversing conversation two person similar exchange person something else computer exchange idea opinion organized series human right discussion representative party conflict aimed resolution constructive logger environmentalist conversational element literary dramatic composition little dialogue film writes realistic musical composition two part suggestive conversation That opening wording indicates either spelling may used meaning follow
The also first series include entry window computer screen choosing option inputting information The wording entry indicates view legitimate variant spelling
argues writer may use either referring conversation two people person script referring similar exchange person computer may use term refers narrowly computer screen window
fifth edition likewise entry rival dictionary point
Nevertheless may interest EL U reader know computer magazine I worked many year spelling list included following entry referring speech We maintained strict distinction interaction human speech throughout year I worked house rule may gone back even farther
So least one publisher explicitly call different spelling depending meaning term
In contrast used spelling sense word
As called exception listed either term

Statistics show average human regardless gender use word per day
When think human development infant cry adult adept communication astounding
Since one literature primary aim replicate human existence thereby search meaning writer past present used dialogue represent communicative faculty
In literature simply stylized written spoken exchange two people
While prevalent tool fiction also see nonfiction poetry
A writer use dialogue date back classical literature namely Plato work
Plato philosopher largely used dialogic method argument rhetorical purpose
In modern literature use dialogue color character personality create conflict advance plot showcase language dialect spoken native people region
Let take look example see skilled writer used dialogue meaning resonance
In first example master language Ernest Hemingway us dialogue simmer conflict like sauteed vegetable bubbling stove
Here excerpt short story Like White Elephants realize girl said
maybe stop talking
They sat table girl looked across hill dry side valley man looked table
got realize said I want want
I perfectly willing go mean anything
mean anything
We could get along
course
But I want anybody
I want anyone else
And I know perfectly simple
know perfectly simple
right say I know
something
anything
please please please please please please please stop talking
He say anything looked bag wall station
There label hotel spent night Get FREE access day create account
While explicit story girl Jig American discussing abortion
He claim repeatedly imagery story crossroad railway station setting indication Jig crossroad decision baby well relationship American
What masterful Hemingway use dialogue tension conflict muted
Because nondescript pronoun Hemingway accomplishes twofold purpose implies intimacy familiar manner conversing also intimate frequency conversation
It topic beaten ground Jig explosion
Let turn attention different example see use vernacular dialogue
Here excerpt Harper Lee I never knew took care child Helen away
Calpurnia said hard Helen walk nearly mile way avoid Ewells according Helen first time tried use public road
Link Deas eventually received impression Helen coming work morning wrong direction dragged reason
let Link please suh Helen begged
hell I said Link
He told come store afternoon left
She Link closed store put hat firmly head walked Helen home Here see Harper even slight use distinguishes Helen African American Maycomb Alabama setting story
The use also provides u hint historical context well even take look short excerpt without fuller story
So even single word choice larger realm dialogue writer imply lot information character plot tone etc
As seen skilled writer use accomplish objective literature
Dialogue reveal conflict tension give reader feeling tenor relationship
It establish setting make character would description
One specific way writer imply culture ethnicity story add vernacular dialogue
This color given character personality background also add texture prose
The weight dialogue literature may fluctuate writer use dialogue sparingly given time period especially contemporary literature dialogue front stage center

Dialog map used either group meeting minute organizing knowledge
Maps grow big thus submaps useful illustrating detailed study

Within computer known called
create demo demonstrate ability
The key difference classical animation demo display demo computed making computing power consideration biggest challenge
Demos mostly composed mixed
The boot block demo demo created fit within small generally byte first block loaded typically created could boast accomplishment prior loading game
What began type electronic cracked software became unto
The produced inspired many technique used application today instance among others
frequently described demo digital emphasizing underground nature demoscene well way demo used proclaim authoring gang superiority
described demo digital referring creation aesthetically pleasing work overcoming strict technical restriction
There demo available great variety
Currently new demo program designed run operating system demo still actively made many machine including old new computer console mobile device
The main historical platform include demo competition platform still relatively common today demo party
There even demo running diverse platform
Unlike mainstream activity creating demo old computer commonly associated technical challenge nostalgic feeling
The accomplishment new groundbreaking thing major driving force demoscene limit various piece obsolete hardware still pushed forward several group
Even many democoders programming restricted platform order get touch way democoding longer available modern PCs
In still quite common different platform le separate demoscenes
When user different platform participated single event considered obvious split competition category supported platform
separate demo intro competition PC Amiga
Nowadays availability decent video capture brought different scene closer together
Alternative platform include interpreter applet even
Software platform restriction like however earned respect majority demosceners
In many released early equipment like including prevent unauthorised copy
Some cracker group started release game protection removed
Simple noninteractive demo also released book magazine often invitation expand listing game
Initially small demo shown actual game including music animation marquee greeting represent releasing group
The quality demo quickly considered figurehead group
Intros increased quality often touching limit computer ability
The cracker group started severe competition first releasing cracked copy game
At moment levering copy protection decreased importance artist inside scene
They felt programming ambitious Intros challenging
While publisher improved copy protection quality Intros increased well
Often fame group based spectacular Intros
The introduction computer system like resulted new distribution work inside group since hardware allowed new possibility
The creation Intros divided programming music graphic
Intros often spread
At end unlicensed copy increasingly became issue software industry
The development game certain platform stopped entirely due insufficient profit claimed cracker scene responsible doom Amiga platform
Some Amiga game released cracker released commercially
Eventually around year people concentrated making pure demo without sort game context led release demo computer art without illegal distribution computer game
Some group remained engaged pirate game demo whereas many group concentrated making demo
Towards end commercial lifetime Amiga ST computer separation cracking demo group yet widened
Small file size integral feature certain type demo beginning needed squeeze crack intro small leftover area
It also important advertisement intro relatively small since typically included every file downloaded BBS
Sometimes even platform dictated size restriction size generally byte also maximum size boot block demo
The common size limit intro hand segment size also maximum size
In later time practical need small demo diminished willingness compete squeezing much little space disappeared
It therefore necessary introduce artificial size restriction order challenge author
In modern demoscene event relatively loose size restriction quite strict limit kilobyte le
Because strict size limit intro show programmer ability squeeze much little space often generating graphic sound data rather reading datafile
Because extremely low size limit intro used lack sound extremely low quality music
As technology progress however sound synthesis become new frontier demoscene
still lowest border demosceners demoparties organize byte byte even byte intro competition
While creating might require programming knowledge anymore competition require demo coder skilled assembly programming algorithmic optimization
For comparison The size section article kilobyte
technique developed small intro worked way mainstream gaming game
There several category demo informally classified
The common way classify demo platform size class purpose content style demo also matter
An originally referred endless demo action happened single graphical screen often promote BBS game crack
Nowadays refer demo written within strict size limit kB kB
Also demo written announcement purpose demo party invitation typically called intro regardless actual size
Many demosceners reserve term demo exclusively demo compete demo competition rather intro competition
However current trend squeezing whole demo within strict size limit decreased kind division
Most demo party least one intro competition rule nearly main demo competition exception size limit executable file
The common intro type size executable file limited byte respectively
Some intro type defined content rather size may also name
Crack intro attached cracked game perhaps oldest category intro
demo intro serve invitation demo party
A announce new demo group announce new group member recruit others
For real life event announce wedding even also called announce birth child demo scener
The term much le common either mean demo intro demo size short preview upcoming demo
A megademo demo consists data
An Amiga standard disk plus packing advantage size qualifies megademo
The first trackloaded demo short Trackmos megademos released Amiga
Megademos quite uncommon today demoscene
The term often used computer data would unusual impossible describe demo several part larger typical demo
For example Shock Megademo closer kilobyte size
Or classic space
As demoscene grew demogroups became competitive term could accomplish megademos developed became elaborate
Megademos soon became collection demoscreens brought together one compilation usually written demogroup often featuring one guest demo member member demo group
These demo accessible menu style varied user selecting demo simple list name interactive method choosing demo using keyboard mouse navigate avatar stick man race car spaceship around display demoscreen found activated
These megademos usually followed format whereby one two intro first displayed main menu presented user could select demo wished view
There often one demoscreens available megademos access point hidden certain key combination entered user reveal hidden demo
Hints existence method access hidden demo could usually found reading scrolling text one demo within megademo
As megademos became popular number demoscreens available would increase size often span two disk requiring user swap disk main menu whichever demo resided second disk
Since early predominant demo format visual effect follow set timeline synchronized continuous soundtrack much like music video
The word track also refers data track floppy disk therefore called trackmo original sense demo run diskette use trackloader read data
The first trackmos included Enigma Phenomena Mental Hangover Amiga
Demos consist program traditionally considered three main element demo associated respectively
The overall design also considered important although group lack specialized designer
Demos executable program program code created coder still considered important element demo
Although program known allow creation technically decent demo without coder involvement demo group using code still widely frowned upon
It customary release demo various reason although handful notable demo source code released
Earliest demo typically made program used cracker crack copy protection
The next step transition monitor
programming language C started gradually take assembly programming demo timing longer considered important compiler beginning able produce code comparable assembly
The transition language originated PC scene
Nowadays demo programmed pure assembly rare PC except extreme category assembly still widely considered relevant choice democoding platform Commodore
Snippets program code performing visual trick collectively called always integral part demo
Effects often used show programmer skill although seldom used content element
See
used demo since beginning copied software needed packed compact easily spreadable format often required kind compression software attached intro
Early demo often multiple part separately decompressed memory short pause part
The demo intro modern platform compressed either executable compressor program specifically designed compression small intro
The decompressor stub integrated intro often well byte size
Some intro may even wrap inside order eliminate byte
Decompression facility provided operating system may also used
Many intro use procedural technique texture object music
Some idea pioneered The Black Lotus PC intro
Nowadays achievement group
Procedural generation often disguised compression order increase amusement value
See example end scrollers
Recently competition held procedural rendered graphic fit executable file kilobyte
These picture often consist landscape size executable file challenge
Demos written older platform often use video mode rather standard one
Some example Drawing art newly invented graphic mode often require sceners first write graphic editor
Recently become le difficult crossplatform tool like Graph Font Atari computer Grafx Amstrad CPC
Music generally integral part demo lack soundtrack tolerated intro category
Before advent music editing software music earliest cracktros demo often game
However developed group began creating music specifically demo
Certain early group even specialized music
Early soundtrack typically synthetic style originated
The Oldskool chiptune style continued later Amiga Atari PC intro due efficient use memory even though system often allowed playback full digital sound sample
The development greatly affected style demo music making possible program many genre music although variant widespread
Today demo music remains electronic even though streaming format allow use type soundtrack
With le limitation sound playback demo musician may use professional audio tool create complex soundtrack possible earlier tracker software
Many demo group created music editor released music editor right
example include classical PC tracker respectively modular synthesizer
On Amiga platform format almost universally used allowed playback little CPU overhead
In demo music played back stock player routine player routine specific music editor
Specialized player also common particularly intro
Modern intro often contain may even written specific song mind
In demoscene parlance typically includes work still image texture charsets short character set monospaced font scene object color scheme
Effects visualization usually regarded graphic
The traditional form graphic art demo made dedicated editor commercial graphic software
The still image modern PC demo usually made software
The technical skill artist often stressed far originality imagination gave birth many clichés demoscene art
fantasy theme dragon sword spaceship common image woman clothed naked
The earliest object scene demo often simplistic constructed coder often without software whatsoever
Nowadays many demo several complex scene lack still art entirely
In many group advanced routine capable dealing complex object lacked member skilled interested modeling
This lead many demo simple procedural object example file object duck
The use stock object origin lot insider humor within demoscene
broadest sense refers everything combine separate element demo consistent whole synchronization soundtrack visuals overall choice concept structure narrative
active Amiga early known one first group paid considerable attention design aspect
While demoscene already phenomenon day lot demo common element reiterated modern demo well
It traditionally standard demo creator send demoscene group typically platform
While often used early day current graphically complex demo greets usually presented demo effect mapping group name onto object using particle system fill letter groupname
Being greeted demo usually considered honor especially demo
While rule one greet tradition dictate group send greeting group consider friend
Other group usually newcomer demo scene sufficient contact prefer greet group whose work consider influential
Some group occasionally send greeting individual people
Greetings sometimes include fucking creator explain dismay another group production behavior
Fuckings common early day demoscene quite rare nowadays mostly used comedic effect
One fucking demo appeared Nexus scroller said It important demo display list name people made demo
These also usually presented graphical effect group prefer cinematic approach present credit opening scene overlay end
Credits demo however rarely feature creator real name opting use instead
There recurring element demo sometimes due technicality demomaking sometimes certain trend scene tend reappear year
Historically popular theme computer since bouncing ball demo released computer
It later became primary theme early Atari game
released bouncing ball demo illustrate capability VIC chip
A similar theme used Amiga Corporation demonstrate capability Amiga computer Winter Consumer Electronics Show January
It showing spinning ball bouncing casting shadow bouncing ball became official logo company
Within context tradition bouncing ball demo Consumer Electronics Show CBS Electronics also showed Bouncing Ball demo spinning bouncing ball event

Welcome
Scientific demonstration experiment two different type scientific test used educational setting
Many people use two term interchangeably however difference type scientific test
Scientific demonstration experiment much
Do time read article
A scientific demonstration explanation process illustrated example serf proof evidence scientific principle In word

The teacher introducing student scientific method modeling process demonstration
The student observing happening absorbing information storing later use
While student may participate teacher remains driving force behind type scientific test
An experiment test trial done purpose discovering something unknown validating theoretical In educational setting student driving force behind experiment teacher play supervisory role
In type scientific test student discovering new aspect science previously unknown He testing think true based knowledge principle work learning real answer experience
Â So difficult make educated guess hypothesis outcome scientific test
Unlike experiment scientific demonstration require student formulate hypothesis teacher demonstrates type scientific test
Â She guide student process spoon feed necessary information mean student able focus learning science occurring right front
Let clear saying younger student completely capable guessing outcome scientific However difference The educated guess known hypothesis scientific method requires scientist least background knowledge principle work trying test
The scientist using scientific method taking look new aspect scientific principle testing theoretical principle determine This mean type scientific test completely blind one employing scientific method fullest seek understand science going behind test guessing outcome
Â This student progress middle high school year move watching scientific demonstration performing experiment
As student expands knowledge scientific principle capable charge scientific test So student age role teacher shift demonstrator During experiment teacher watching student making sure follows step maintaining safe environment student work answering question may along way
Whether choose use scientific demonstration experiment homeschool largely depend age student grasp scientific We recommend perform scientific demonstration elementary year shift towards using experiment middle high school year
Here helpful resource help aspect science

Podcast Episodes Tips Homeschool Science Show
Articles Elemental Science Blog
A book help dig even deeper topic If still question leave comment andÂ answer
This helpful teacher student others educated properly easy understand site summarizes defenition easier fir others learn step step Doris Typically I recommend science fair project grade
If want one younger student I would make display simple visual
You use four category suggested post record experiment http guideline making board
If looking guidance science fair check following blog series I wrote http book The Science Fair Project A Guide http
Paige If science fair elementary school allowing grade demonstration experiment guideline procedure recommend demonstration
We scientific method guide experiment
We need guideline requirement provide demonstration create display science demonstration
I hope suggestion

A cool experiment I demonstration property different gas
The air around actually made number gas mixed together use oxygen breathe nitrogen oxygen gas mostly argon water vapor
As see air actually made mostly nitrogen mostly unreactive gas
There lot gas though really exciting property
Most people familiar glow stick see time around holiday like Halloween Independence Day
Even glow stick still amazing see action
They create soft light color last hour day without producing heat whatsoever unlike electric light bulb get super hot
We create glow stick reaction show super bright last long neat experiment mixing two different color see happens
Way back I posted neat color change experiment called
Nowadays different demonstration place called Chemical Traffic Light
This one great presentation actually repeatable pretty rare chemistry
This favorite experiment I done far
The Barking Dog really exciting demonstration chemical reaction one material burn another
This demonstration beautifully brings together many topic Bill I talk show like energy light sound color
Sometimes I like play little trick brother know anything chemistry get mix chemical together
After getting put safety gear glove goggles I tell mix two different chemical together
Usually wrong purpose probably trick come
If put much one almost explodes ton foam steam
It bonus get foam usually get way time
One demonstration show classic chemistry experiment called Chemical Chameleon
This color changing reaction proceeds number different beautiful color involves really interesting chemistry
The Tesla Coil use show modern version classic device invented
Our coil called DDSSTC Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil
This mean coil controlled transistor like computer reading
This modern upgrade device Tesla created called SSTC Spark Gap Tesla Coil

Podcast Subscribe CC Image Courtesy Vandy CFT This third series article help prepare teaching job interview
In last two article I discussed prepare
In article I share four thing help prepare teaching demonstration
Most applicant applying teaching position seem teaching experience either Teaching Assistant TA graduate school adjunct faculty trainer industry specialized
If happen one fortunate enough classroom instructional experience
However case applicant prevent still able perform teaching demonstration exceptionally well prepared
While prior teaching experience helpful important possessing excellent communication skill ability connect engage student
Since teaching demonstration relatively short usually minute length limited time show hiring committee well able articulate thought concept teaching
You also assessed ability peak student interest engage delivery communication
The following four tip help better prepare teaching demonstration Your hiring committee likely provide topic teaching demonstration advance
Make use early notice ensure familiarize topic going demo
If lucky assigned topic familiar
When I went teaching demo topic I assigned little discipline college level I would teaching hired
Thankfully topic I extremely familiar I studied researched written graduate school
Familiarity topic extremely important boost confidence prepare deliver demonstration
So make sure know everything need know topic
Having said need remember hiring committee future student need know everything know
Your job cover topic need know help achieve lesson course objective
Once feel confident mastery topic need teach time begin creating outline need include demo
Remember minute perform teaching demo need selective cover
As I stated earlier job teach everything know merely student hiring committee need know topic allotted time
When planning outline include following three thing When planning teaching demo identify visual aid provided hiring committee determine would best help cover content plan presenting
Some content best delivered digital presentation software smart board white board still effective type content
The advantage digital presentation PowerPoint Keynote Prezi Google Slides use demo time actually generate content slide since would done advance
When putting presentation together keep slide simple avoid tiny text overcrowding
A good limit slide bullet word per bullet
Some presentation designer even suggest word total per slide
Pick whichever work avoid listing paragraph lot text slide would ineffective
In two example first slide contains left ten word second slide right contains five word
Too Much Text
This slide document
Students focused say busily reading copying slide
Bear mind minute teach presentation long
If presentation minute I recommend slide
There lot said design read Garr Reynolds I would highly suggest
The two key point I want emphasis regard design font image
Be sure use font style size large enough see easy read screen
I recommend using member font family Arial Verdana Tahoma
As size remember presentation word document go large
Your font size larger
If choose add image presentation sure include large high quality image
You want image easily seen look professional
Avoid pixelated blurry image unclear make look like amateur
In two example emphasis high resolution image limited text slide
The image slide take majority real estate slide without looking pixelated blurry
Too blurry
Once completed presentation sure slide multiple time
Regardless method choose adopt helpful plan case experience glitch day demo
If digital presentation sure presentation saved multiple format including PDF
Sometimes version PowerPoint Keynote save file compatible version school event able open presentation file correctly computer still able open PDF
The PDF version include animation sound video transition may included original presentation least use demo
In addition digital presentation I would also recommend providing hardcopy presentation committee well
Your teaching demonstration assessed number thing including Prepare teaching demonstration early possible practice teaching presentation comfortable delivering material without referring note slide
If possible record giving teaching demonstration using camcorder review footage see well need improve
When reviewing video ask following thing If really want go extra mile preparation ask friend colleague give feedback presentation video
Be sure find someone actually help improve demo shy providing constructive feedback
So recap four thing need prepare teaching demonstration job interview Well I hope found article useful
If I grateful help spread word sharing friend colleague
And good luck teaching demonstration
Thank

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What difference
In context work software company presentation would include powerpoint slide list screen shot software functionality
A demonstration would include using software show demonstrate functionality complete task
For one thing could involve hundred thousand people marching street maybe throwing petrol bomb
A rarely involves handful usually one person standing front audience talking
Without context hard specific
In case word interchangeable
Assuming demonstration mean somebody showing something others rather angry mob street A demonstration type presentation
A presentation situation present material others
The typical presentation lecture visual aid like slide
A demonstration actually show something
If bulk time taken showing thing demonstrated usually call demonstration demo even also accompanying slide
If time spent slide talking demonstration small part better call presentation presentation includes demo set people expectation correctly
someone showing something someone work
someone presenting something group person either chart diagram slide etc

Buenos días
Nació en la Gran Manzana
Criado en Puerto Rico
De vuelta con nosotros está Pérez
Hola tal amigo
Hola muy bien con gusto de estar aquí
tú qué tal

Contento de estar aquí una vez más trayéndote mucha salsa
Oye mucho tiempo sin verte desde Calle
Te veo más delgado pero estás por todos lados en canales de televisión promocionando tu nuevo disco Salseros unidos en muchas presentaciones por Nueva York Puerto Rico San Francisco cuéntanos
Exactamente el Carnaval de San Francisco fue un exitazo grandísimo como persona quienes le encanta la salsa
De cierta forma estás como retomando tu carrera
Sí sí pero yo siempre estado ocupado activo trabajando en otros países
Y pues este nuevo proyecto que comenzado e titulado Salseros unidos
Háblanos de este disco porque hemos tenido mucho tiempo de hablar de la producción completa
Sí bueno esta producción e muy especial para mí
Este Salseros unidos sale de la muerte de un compañero nuestro
Llamo unificar los salseros del mundo vengo le escribo junto con Pedro Jesús
Colaboraron conmigo varios artistas en el video menciono la mayoría de ellos en la canción
Hagamos un pequeño flashback del comienzo de tu carrera
recuerdas
Bueno yo comencé los años oyendo los temas de Héctor Lavoe los cantaba en el baño escuchando Cheche Colé Abuelita tus refranes hace reír
pero lo cantabas igualito
Yo canto bastante bien como Héctor
Pero para llenar esos zapatos se necesita te acuerdas
A propósito de Héctor viste la película El cantante

Y exhorto al público que la vaya ver
Lo que hicieron Marc Anthony su esposa Jennifer e traer esta leyenda la pantalla gigante para que el mundo el mundo el mundo entero conozca quien fue este señor
que más te ha gustado de la película
Son los chistes que decía Héctor Lavoe como era él
Gracias Lefty Pérez
Bendiciones
Éxitos
Te quiero
Salúdame Panamá

Con gusto
Chévere
Un abrazo
Un abrazo gracias

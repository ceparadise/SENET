method running application software storing related data central computer system providing customer user access
The origin expression obscure appears derive practice using drawing stylized cloud denote network diagram computing communication system
The term came popular use though practice providing remote access computing function network date back system
In book Canadian electrical engineer Douglas Parkhill predicted computer industry would come resemble many remotely located user connected via communication link central computing For decade effort create computer utility frustrated constraint capacity telephone system
It cheaper easier company organization store data run application private computing system maintained within facility
The constraint network capacity began removed telecommunication company invested network response rapidly growing use Internet shared network exchanging information
In late number company called application service provider ASPs founded supply computer application company Internet
Most early ASPs failed model supplying application remotely became popular decade later renamed cloud computing
Cloud computing number different service
One set service sometimes called SaaS involves supply discrete application outside user
The application geared either business user accounting application consumer application storing sharing personal photograph
Another set service variously called utility computing grid computing hardware service HaaS involves provision computer processing data storage outside user able run application store data remote system
A third set service sometimes called platform service PaaS involves supply remote computing capacity along set tool use outside software programmer
Early pioneer cloud computing include supply popular business application managing sale marketing effort addition supply array application known consumer business Amazon Web Services division online retailer offer access computing system developer company individual
Cloud computing also underpins popular online medium site
Traditional software company including also introduced cloud application
company either charge user service subscription usage fee provide free access service charge company placing advertisement service
Because profitability cloud service tends much lower profitability selling licensing hardware component software program viewed potential threat business many traditional computing company
Construction large data centre run service often requires investment hundred million dollar
The centre typically contain thousand computer networked together system
The centre also often employ sophisticated virtualization technology allow computer system divided many virtual machine rented temporarily customer
Because intensive use electricity centre often located near hydroelectric dam source cheap plentiful
Because cloud computing involves storage often sensitive personal commercial information central system run third party raise concern data privacy security well transmission data across national boundary
It also stir fear eventual creation data monopoly oligopoly
Some believe cloud computing like public utility come heavily regulated government
increasingly adopted source information service
It offer access via Internet service furnished provider run data centre necessary software resource
The service provided one Internet often called cloud computing

Understanding ethical behavior context corporate governance requires two level analysis internal concern corporate agency emergent effect social welfare
based premise employee manager director agent behave best interest owner shareholder principal
Two thing get way ideal First manager interest overlapping shareholder distinct
Sometimes agent help way hurt firm shareholder
Examples include shirking waste extreme case fraud action bring company happened numerous business scandal
Second shareholder neither specific knowledge skill possessed management
That create dynamic even manager may feel compelled acting way look good shareholder actually undermine value creation time
Various oversight transparency incentive mechanism evolved continue develop contain agency cost
based premise company engage fair dealing customer employee supplier community well accordance expectation larger society operate
The debate fair dealing reflects larger ongoing debate purpose corporation society even model recognizes company benefit least nurturing reputation among stakeholder minimizing negative externality pollution plant closure etc
preserve freedom company operate otherwise minimal external constraint
While traditional corporation expected prioritize shareholder interest stakeholder considerable extent attempt maximize shareholder value within legal constraint corporate form permit balanced approach shareholder vendor cooperative shareholder specified constituency
This page feature research best way address agency problem evolving relationship corporation society
The business judgment rule allows board manager easily get away pet project avoidance difficult decision excuse long music playing industry But every time corporation give ground capital market behavior come one step closer losing viability entity ability afford maintenance stakeholder ecosystem
It interesting see able survive current capital market derive capital exclusively endowment supported hybrid market evolve accommodate
A close corollary willingness get rid wrong CEO
Boards force work conscientiously personally uncomfortable especially CEO want spend time
Boards also reluctant force change since CEO transition generally create dip stock price done right company quickly end ahead would otherwise
These constraint make easier management board fact make compelling practice via earning management
But company considerable leeway choosing whether play game
Incessant criticism CEO pay driven board focus compensation cost point ignoring incentive effect
Overpaying CEO could result waste million dollar large company avoided
However similarly sized company difference mediocre incentive good incentive easily worth hundred million dollar
Much corporate governance discussion last two decade appropriately focused need better monitoring research indicates pendulum may swung far advisory role board getting short shrift
When two role come conflict invariably must board job resolve conflict best possible favor shareholder interest
Companies benefit constantly questioning right better rather assume everything fine time good sweeping change necessary time get rough
It tough public company avoid reaction since bias least strong among investor community
There great deal research common approach including enhancing oversight reducing informational asymmetry improving alignment Improving oversight via specified board structure appears mixed result
show relationship board independence firm performance meaning one gain via better monitoring may lost specific knowledge needed provide quality input
One exception CEO audit compensation committee required law
Annual term director opposed group director elected overlapping term may also increase value board busy director three board seat interlocking director evidence multiple country avoided
The governance indicator convincingly associated better performance degree insider point
found strong relationship insider ownership firm performance confirmed numerous later study recently stronger result higher inside ownership percent
High inside ownership work reduce impact asymmetrical information enhance alignment
Increased exposure stock value via option grant also appears enhance alignment value creation
Furthermore appear equity incentive associated accounting fraud assumed accounting scandal following tech bust
Nor appear stock option high cash bonus contributed poor performance credit crisis
However select incentive compensation mechanism improve alignment management shareholder appear enhance value creation
While legal requirement constraint board historically low via state regulation rapidly increasing via federal regulation mixed result
Disclosure increase transparency voluntary disclosure enhances firm value mandatory disclosure may
While many people believe initiative originate government agency NGOs believe initiative properly belong within corporation believe require corporate vehicle look beyond profit
Corporate social responsibility CSR corporate social performance CSP significantly correlated financial performance necessarily shareholder value
Whether CSR CSP result rather driver strong financial performance subject ongoing study

She suggests company actually show revealed preference broader stakeholder standard good governance
similarly argue broader societal view value creation essential future corporate growth
How combination perverse incentive lack transparency killed highflying company

This entail expanding growing research effectiveness various governance standard improving shareholder value

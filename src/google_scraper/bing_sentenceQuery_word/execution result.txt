In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

In time program running contrast
A error detected execution running state program whereas error detected program ever executed
code optimization typically done compile time may done run time depending particular language compiler
When program executed first performs necessary setup link program need execution begin starting program
In case language implementation task done language runtime instead though unusual mainstream language common consumer operating system
Some program debugging performed efficient accurate performed runtime
bound checking example
For reason programming discovered program tested real data despite sophisticated checking testing
In case end user may encounter message
one language feature designed handle runtime error providing structured way catch completely unexpected situation well predictable error unusual result without amount inline error checking required language without
More recent advancement runtime engine enable provides debug information every exception interest implemented independent source code attaching special software product runtime engine

When looking concurrent programming two term commonly used
concurrent parallel
And programming language specifically claim support parallel programming
Does mean parallel concurrent programming actually different
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Distinguish parallelism using extra computational unit work per unit time concurrency managing access shared resource
Teach parallelism easier help establish sequential mindset
From A Introduction Parallelism Concurrency Dan Grossman version November Conurrency parallelism differ problem solve cause independent
Executing two task mean individual step task executed interleaved fashion
If disregard parallelism assume one statement executed point time priori guarantee task get execute next step
This useful regard Some main challenge Executing two task mean statement executed
This mainly useful Key challenge include See also distinguishing parallel distributed computing
In addition Nish answer let recommend Simon Marlow book
They answer first question Haskell perspective could better suited theoretically inclined reader Haskell purely functional lazy programming language much closer Mathematics language
Quoting In many field word parallel concurrent synonym programming used describe fundamentally different concept
A parallel program one us multiplicity computational hardware
multiple processor core order perform computation quickly
Different part computation delegated different processor execute time parallel result may delivered earlier computation performed sequentially
In contrast concurrency technique multiple thread control
Notionally thread control execute time user see effect interleaved
Whether actually execute time implementation detail concurrent program execute single processor interleaved execution multiple physical processor
I recommend reading rest tutorial let quote remainder section connects programming paradigm quantitative qualitative characteristic program efficiency modularity determinism
While parallel programming concerned efficiency concurrent programming concerned structuring program need interact multiple independent external agent example user database server external client
Concurrency allows program modular thread interacts user distinct thread talk database
In absence concurrency program written event loop callback indeed event loop callback often used even concurrency available many language concurrency either expensive difficult use
The notion thread control make sense purely functional program effect observe evaluation order irrelevant
So concurrency structuring technique effectful code Haskell mean code IO monad
A related distinction deterministic nondeterministic programming model
A deterministic programming model one program give one result whereas nondeterministic programming model admits program may different result depending aspect execution
Concurrent programming model necessarily nondeterministic must interact external agent cause event unpredictable time
Nondeterminism notable drawback however program become signifficantly harder test reason
For parallel programming would like use deterministic programming model possible
Since goal arrive answer quickly would rather make program harder debug process
Deterministic parallel programming best world testing debugging reasoning performed sequential program program run faster processor added
Indeed computer processor implement deterministic parallelism form pipelining multiple execution unit
While possible parallel programming using concurrency often poor choice concurrency sacriffices determinism
In Haskell parallel programming model deterministic
However important note deterministic programming model sufficient express kind parallel algorithm algorithm depend internal nondeterminism particularly problem involve searching solution space
In Haskell class algorithm expressible using concurrency

What difference asynchronous synchronous execution
When execute something synchronously wait finish moving another task
When execute something asynchronously move another task finish
That said context computer translates executing process task another thread
A thread series command block code exists unit work
The operating system manage multiple thread assign thread piece slice processor time switching another thread give turn work
At core pardon pun processor simply execute command concept two thing one time
The operating system simulates allocating slice time different thread
Now introduce multiple mix thing CAN actually happen time
The operating system allocate time one thread first processor allocate block time another thread different processor
All allowing operating system manage completion task go code thing
Asynchronous programming complicated topic semantics thing tie together time
There numerous article book subject look
Synchronous mean connected dependent way
In word two synchronous task must aware one another one task must execute way dependent wait start task completed
Asynchronous mean totally independent neither one must consider way either initiation execution
Synchronous one thread Synchronous Asynchronous one thread Asynchronous Technically concept really
Although general unusual find asynchronous task running thread possible see example find two task executing synchronously thread No concept whether second subsequent task initiated first task completed whether must wait
That
What thread thread process CPUs indeed hardware task executed relevant
Indeed make point I edited graphic show
ASYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
In solving many engineering problem software designed split overall problem multiple individual task execute asynchronously
Inverting matrix finite element analysis problem good example
In computing sorting list example
The quick sort routine example split list two list sort calling recursively
In example two task often executed asynchronously
They need separate thread
Even machine one CPU one thread execution coded initiate processing second task first one completed
The criterion
As long start end time task overlap possible output neither needed input executed asynchronously matter many thread use
SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
Any process consisting multiple task task must executed sequence one must executed another machine Fetch update data get stock quote financial service etc
If separate machine separate thread whether synchronous asynchronous
In simpler term SYNCHRONOUS You queue get movie ticket
You get one everybody front get one applies people queued behind
ASYNCHRONOUS You restaurant many people
You order food
Other people also order food wait food cooked served order
In kitchen restaurant worker continuously cooking serving taking order
People get food served soon cooked
I try explain simply I hopefully remember My bos busy man
He tell write code
I tell Fine
I get started watching like vulture standing behind shoulder
I like Dude WTF go something I finish
like No I finish
This synchronous
The bos tell rather waiting right work bos go task
When I finish job I simply report bos say I DONE
This Asynchronous Execution
It really simple
Hope help
Take advice NEVER work bos behind
mean execution happens single series

If calling routine run finish start finish start etc
With begin routine let run background start next point say wait finish
It like finish The advantage execute still running background separate thread take better advantage resource fewer hang wait
Synchronous mean caller wait response completion asynchronous caller continues response come later applicable
As example This always ouput But make doSomething asynchronous multiple way output become Because method making asynchronous call would immediately continue next line code
I say could order execution ca guaranteed asynch operation
It could also execute original depending thread timing etc
I think bit explanation still clarifies using real life example
Small Example Let say playing audio involves three step If audio player step sequentially every song synchronous
You wait time hear song till song actually get fetched decompressed
If audio player step independent asynchronous
ie
While playing audio step fetch audio harddisk parallel step decompresses audio parallel
step You end hearing song without waiting much fetch decompress
In nutshell synchronization refers two process point
In example Process A endpoint synchronized Process B start point Asynchronous process hand start endpoint synchronized Where Process A overlap Process B running concurrently dictionary definition hence confusion
It might helpful think term asynchronous synchronous instead asynchronous synchronous
Simply said asynchronous execution stuff background
For example want download file internet might use synchronous function block thread file finished downloading
This make application unresponsive user input
Instead could download file background using asynchronous method
In case download function return immediately program execution continues normally
All download operation done background program notified finished
When executing sequence like b c get failure middle execution like Then beginning synchronous If however sequence execute b c failure middle instead restarting beginning point failure know asynchronous
You confusing Synchronous Parallel v Series
Synchronous mean time
Syncronized mean related othere mean series fixed interval
While program running series
Get dictionary unsweet tea
You tea sweetened tea
Synchronous basically mean execute one thing time
Asynchronous mean execute multiple thing time finish executing current thing order move next one
As really simple example Imagine school student instructed walk queue road
The student got shoelace untied
Now stopped tying
All student behind stopped waiting get tied
The student walked past continuing usual pace
Just Imagine random people walking road
They queue course randomly walking different place road different pace
person shoelace got untied
She stopped get tied
But nobody waiting get tied
Everyone else still walking way pace
A synchronous operation work returning caller
An asynchronous operation work returning caller
When task executed synchronously wait task completed moving another task
One task depends end another When task executed asynchronously directly switch another task previous completed
One task depend
In programming task executed
It necessary understand several thread created task order avoid stacking single queue
That said concept synchronous asynchronous much thread reason I mention rare see task running asynchronously single thread although technically possible
In regard definition synchronous execution sometimes confusing good way understand Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

A basic unit used computer science
Nodes device data point larger network
Devices personal computer cell phone printer node
When defining node internet node anything
Nodes individual part larger data structure
Nodes contain also may link node
Links node often implemented
Nodes often arranged tree structure
These structure
A node represents information contained single structure
These node may contain value condition possibly serve another independent data structure
Nodes represented single parent node
The highest point tree structure called root node parent node serf parent node tree
The height node determined total number edge path node furthest leaf node height tree equal height root node
Node depth determined distance particular node root node
The root node said depth zero
Data discovered along network path
An IP address us kind system node define location network
Another common use node tree
In programming used communicate information computer programmer computer alike
For reason XML used create common used serf base development modern web like
Though similar approached programmer typically language used develop website text design
While XML HTML XHTML provide language expression serf translator
Different type node tree represented specific interface
In word node type defined communicates node
Each node node type property specifies type node sibling leaf
For example node type property constant property node property specifies type node
So node type property constant node one know node object object Element
This object us Element interface define method property particular node
Node Types Different node type description A node object represented single node tree
It element node attribute node text node type described section node type
All object inherit property method dealing parent child node object parent child node
For example text node child node similar node add child node result error
Objects DOM tree may addressed manipulated using method object
The public interface DOM specified API
The history Document Object Model intertwined history late well first widely implemented

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I studying random try one class wondering anyone could offer guidance regarding problem
Given random trie n total leaf letting I number internal node tree node leaf show E I O n
We alphabet letter hence trie corresponding probability
We randomly create n word infinite length drawing first letter distribution second letter etc
Finally insert n infinite word k trie
This trie infinite length prune removing path traversed one n word eliminate
I tried relating thing back size random trie I call S
Every node trie child internal node mI That E I S So I show expected size random trie O n I golden
But unfortunately everything covered class relates expected depth height given trie I idea moving forward
Could anyone offer advice might useful
If node trie tree leaf interior node
So case n
It depends bit define trie whether many interior node
If study path node merges edge done
For uncompressed trie I afraid many node
Say one letter common high probability
Then trie contains many long path high probability
In case O n interior node
Please computation might choose smaller like
By posting answer agree

Any system device connected network also called node
For example network connects file server five computer two printer eight node network
Each device network network address uniquely identifies device
This help keep track data transferred network
A node also refer folder file hard disk
In physic node point minimum displacement multiple wave converge creating net amplitude zero

Lists stack queue structure three data structure one item follows another
Trees first structure Trees many us A tree sequence zero connected node example path tree shown The path number node path
The tree length longest path root leaf example height longest path root leaf A C E G A C E J
An empty tree height
The node length path root node example Given two connected node like Node A called node B called
A given node includes one child child
The descendant node node reachable child child etc
In original example node A three subtrees An important special kind tree tree
In binary tree The two tree different child node B different first tree B left child D right child E second tree B left child E right child Also note line used instead arrow
We sometimes clear edge go higher node lower node
Since node never two child node represented using class field one data node plus two child pointer However since node arbitrary number child fixed number field wo work
Instead use List keep child pointer As know list represented using either array
For example consider general tree simplified version original example For array representation List array initial size would Draw similar picture tree List field implemented using linked list
It often useful iterate node tree When iterated List started first node visited node turn
Since node visited best possible complexity O N tree N node
All traversal method achieve complexity
For tree many different order might visit node
There three common traversal order general tree one binary tree preorder postorder level order described
We use illustrate traversal Preorder A preorder traversal defined recursively follows If use preorder traversal example tree given print letter node visit node following printed A B D C E G F H Postorder A postorder traversal similar preorder traversal except root subtree visited rather first If use postorder traversal example tree given print letter node visit node following printed D B G E H I F C A
Level order The idea traversal visit root visit node level away depth root left right node level away depth root etc
For example tree goal visit node following order A traversal requires using queue rather recursive algorithm implicitly us stack
Here print data tree level order using queue Q using iterator access child node assume root node called Treenode class provides method Draw picture Q would time around outer loop code given given
An traversal involves visiting root visiting left right subtrees
Therefore traversal make sense binary tree
The recursive definition If print letter node example tree using traversal following printed D B A E G C H F I The primary difference preorder postorder traversal node visited relation recursive call
What printed following tree visited using preorder traversal b postorder traversal c traversal traversal

Computer science professor delivering stern warning start course like colleague subject deploy software flag plagiarism
They unearthed numerous example suspected cheating
At Brown University half allegation academic code violation last year involved cheating computer science
At Stanford alma mater founder Google Snapchat countless internet wonder many percent student one computer science course flagged possible cheating
And Harvard practically brand slickly produced video thousand class distinguished last fall dubious way According student referred honor council committee review allegation academic dishonesty plagiarism violation honor code

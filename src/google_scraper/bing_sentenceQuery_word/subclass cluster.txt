In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

As possible often encouraged override inherited method provide meaningful implementation
The exact method invoke original overriding version determined class receiver message runtime
It still possible invoke original method sending call super
This demonstrated overriding method inherited NSObject
To demonstrate add following code This method little except call NSObject method Fraction called We also setting ivars zero
method related memory management basically involves releasing memory held object
Because contain object ivars actually anything release
We use skeletal implementation simply call turn call NSObject
Because MixedNumber inherits Fraction whatever get released Fraction also released MixedNumber
As matter fact forget include method get compiler warning
A later lesson focus allow add method class including class access code Apple Foundation UIKit class
Note possible override ivars however MixedNumber show quite easy add new ivar
In addition ivars well almost ivar although rarely used superclass declares directly accessible subclass
There one pitfall involving inherited ivars pointer
If direct assign former simply pointer assuming object superclass ivar mean get freed changed superclass happen subclass
The solution assuming undesired usually declare one parameter header file class
Note applied property object remember primitive type passed pointer anyway issue exist
There exist create class designed used merely object subclassed
For example almost never create use subclass
NSObject therefore abstract class
A variant Foudation fact behind scene number subclass hold different type number
You interact subclass
These class along class cluster
http An object inherits various instance variable method superclass
However fundamental principle inheritance also allow extend superclass well override inherited method replacing different implementation
To illustrate example subclass Fraction class MixedNumber class
Let get started
Mixed Number How would implement mixed number
At initial glance look pretty
A mixed number simply represented integer main number component Fraction object fractional component fact class us another class part data storage known
But good part inheritance instance variable inherits Fraction simply use
Therefore new ivar need add integer numerical portion
In Xcode open FractionDemo project
Click File New In left click Cocoa Class choose Class make sure subclass NSObject click Next
Save File Name make sure check box Also create checked
Click Finish
This take file listing Xcode open text editor
Import make subclass Fraction
Rather providing full listing try figure code
If stuck download full code end post
Add portion synthesize
In add following method implementation Make sure add method declaration header
A thing note Note subclass call one direct superclass overridden method using keyword This work much way keyword except latter refers current instance former refers superclass
A test routine MixedNumber class The code rather make sure understand method called method actually found inheritance chain especially start override method
The output You download latest FractionDemo code
http Inheritance central tenet programming
In nutshell refers creation new class extending existing class feature
In interface file following line The part bold indicates class Apple provides
Nearly every class create interact inherited NSObject directly indirectly
A top inheritance hierarchy
Almost Cocoa Touch Foundation class inherit NSObject
Incidentally NSObject also called designed actually ever use NSObject usually create use subclass
An abstract class therefore one created purpose subclassing
A class inherits another known
Every subclass inherits certain property superclass exactly inherited controlled
By default every class access instance variable superclass work exactly defined ivars subclass
In addition subclass inherit public method superclass defines
As example kept one file brevity Output The inheritance chain As see created instance object type
We used class
Notice however called Subclass accessed ivar neither declared Subclass
This already present Superclass Subclass inherited
The output prof Subclass able access inherited variable
method simply declaration class invoked runtime chosen How program figure method call especially one method name inheritance chain
In fact procedure simple
The runtime environment search explicit declaration method class object sent message example search begin Subclass class
If found class invokes method word invokes version closest class inheritance chain
If found look method superclass found invokes version search continues either method found
In latter case get compiler warning class may respond specific method
When code try call method execution program likely crash

Compute node cluster access three type disk storage The storage intended used stage input file read multiple time well intermediate file
By convention use create use subdirectory username The local cluster storage considered scratch user expected clean file end job
Nodes fail one reason another often without warning resulting loss data stored partition
Given nature cluster network topology possible poorly designed job overwhelm network connection back file system
If job need access remote file multiple time data fit local disk encourage structure code first copy data node access locally
This result increased performance job job running cluster well
If timing code aware accessing file system introduces latency uncertainty
Be sure time computation otherwise measuring may dominated contention Ethernet switch node NFS server NFS server SAN switch disk array disk array

We recommend read information submitting managing job
The scheduler assign job resource using information available
Note assign priority user group
As result time especially near conference deadline user may need coordinate amongst
For example request others hold submitting job day
To use cluster simply using CS username password
This put head node home directory
From submit job Slurm scheduler using command single process job combine MPI job
Details
The head node may used interactive work file editing
The head node may used computationally intensive process
As computational software completely absent head node
It possible get email notification job begin end abort
If submit many job short period time make sure email account prepared receive
That make sure sufficient space Inbox email provider accept message potentially high rate
The CS email system accept message cluster high rate
Because external site frequently blacklist throttle mail server inundated message high rate must send cluster email notification
If forwarding CS Princeton email account external provider Gmail please set filter way prevent forwarding message cluster
These message identified sender address slurm
Those job send large amount output STDOUT STDERR redirect output appropriately job submission script
Otherwise compute node spooling space may fill causing running job fail preventing new job starting
The cluster may brought hardware failure maintenance
Long running job designed regularly checkpoint state resumed event interruption without start entire job
There number different job type run cluster including MPI job single processor job interactive job
These type discussed detail
MPI job run single application multiple CPUs using MPI library call coordinate processing among different CPUs
Single processor job name implies run single CPU
Both job typically initiated creating job file shell script
Interactive job allow user run computationally intensive interactive program cluster developing workload batch job
Jobs submitted cluster using command
The job script always run user current working directory
The submission directory available running job environment variable
Additional shell environment variable maintained scheduling system available script runtime
For list variable see page command
Yes job exceeds requested walltime killed scheduler
If request walltime default hour
The maximum walltime request given job hour one week
For reason good idea ensure job checkpointing capability job killed fails reason lose work already performed
If wish use GPU board must specify need GPU resource using option specify many GPU device job need
Therefore sbatch option like request GPU node GPU capability
Please ensure GPU code respect variable binding GPU mechanism GPUs scheduled allocated
Jobs found using GPUs allocated may killed
Interactive job ionic cluster initiated command head node
You may also want specify resource quantity Please use salloc run interactive job rather mechanism
Using mechanism start interactive job lead failure job accounting making appear though job running extremely inefficiently
Interactive job used troubleshooting mechanism creating batch submission work
If need help forming work batch submission please contact CS Staff happy help
We also ask avoid squatting compute node opening long interactive session without actively using since tie cluster resource could performing work user
Accordingly please make sure exit session finished
Interactive job appear idle long period time may cancelled CS Staff job queue waiting use resource
MPI job ionic cluster executed using command
Here example MPI job submission script
This script assumes script file MPI program binary directory
It specifies hour wall clock time processor node total CPUs
Be sure replace actual email address
Single processor job essentially program wish run batch mode
Just anything would program shell script done single processor job ionic cluster
Of course simplest form job one run single program
You notice job script similar one used MPI job
Again sure replace actual email address
In addition walltime node specify maximum amount physical virtual memory single process job likely use
Using output email add either per node option script
The last line output job completion email includes amount memory used job
If report job used something GB physical memory could modify script line like For future run job modification give scheduler hint job expected use memory
If single processor job need run multiple time exactly command argument like get away single job script command modify line replicate job
The example script run instance command single CPU different node
As example sure replace actual email address
The result script getting submitted using get run different machine
The major problem likely encounter job start job terminate unexpectedly
The first thing look diagnosing job problem STDIN STDOUT output job
Unless direct elsewhere STDIN STDOUT written file named
Another command useful diagnosis command
This command provides accounting information may helpful diagnosing unexpected behavior

I object used NSMutableSet needed stuff attached
The obvious obviously supported thing subclass NSMutableSet tack two additional property
Since NSMutableSet like basically Cocoa data structure class cluster I subclass usual way since super class throw exception
This led several path
The first path create sort composite object declared subclass NSMutableSet really forwarded invocation internal NSMutableSet
I want implement every method NSMutableSet I thought would good way accomplish mission
Unfortunately abstract class NSMutableSet implement method interface implementation throw exception I never getting point I could forward invocation
The second path subclass NSProxy forward invocation
This solution fall short I need copy interface NSMutableSet unless way declare class implement interface I know could well solution
The third path create category NSMutableSet import class need use fall short since add property via category
That led using associated object category
I willing admit correct solution use case I wish since kind clunky
It doubly clunky since property I adding primitive I wrap unwrap setting getting association unless way associate primitive I unfamiliar
Essentially I would like something behaves functionally subclass NSMutableSet class cluster figure best approach
Thanks
For completeness let look first path create sort composite object declared subclass really forwarded invocation internal Can subclass
Yes
The documentation say There little need subclassing
If need customize behavior often better consider composition instead subclassing
So weigh want subclass refer documentation In subclass must override primitive method You must also override primitive method class
And looking class documentation find primitive method In subclass must override primitive method That method
You define class subclass add instance variable instance implement method redirect set instance add whatever init method wish add additional property
If performance concern tradeoff redirecting five method accessing associated object additional property
You need profile work performance becomes issue
Trying subclass Cocoa class cluster create awful lot hurt
It may seem good idea forever run problem
Just create NSObject NSMutableSet first member object
Subclassing Cocoa class cluster kind discouraged
Not without reason
Please enter crashy world
Either solution work
I successfully used first path I believe work fine well
Just remember need override method well
Please consult section Apple doc Although forwarding mimic inheritance NSObject class never confuses two
Methods like respondsToSelector isKindOfClass look inheritance hierarchy never forwarding chain
In case I overridden definitely crucial
I also used third path good result I admit associated object API clunky
First correct
Do subclass class cluster
Just
Can
If I tell ca help convince
I lie help make good choice
But seriousness almost always meaningless well
Is subclass really specific set
Or really kind set
Consider
It kind string string
This almost always better
And also class cluster happen royal pain subclass
That said adding associated value onto data structure already discovered generally fine really want hey I data need go along data
Wrapping gotten easy really slow
See And make really easy But I still come back question whether kind set rather set whether really need respond message sent set
As real need often much smaller practice wrapping handful method need often worth simplicity control

I written algorithm clustering nearest neighbour Euclidean distance metric
I estimate complexity O n k n k genuine cluster
The dimension data result O complexity though I believe mitigated
The algorithm resulting approximate solution
In transformed unit hypercube Although loop contributes complexity pas shrink rapidly resulting n complexity
In fact shrink linearly iteration behaviour
branch incremented every time passed number deleted number point removed pas
That result Gaussians point sampled Gaussian
My code identified six mode though three substantial far
The algorithm start point find nearby neighbour deletes data list repeat point within nearest neighbour
If point nearby neighbour begin new mode
If spread many mode algorithm requires iteration clear mode resulting k complexity
The dimension data limit performance
In higher dimension space point
sphere radius r take fraction space shrink exponentially increasing
This I think could mitigated somewhat increasing algorithm
This justifiable larger space unit hypercube around edge
So overall I estimate complexity O
Is analysis reasonable
Is working algorithm clear
I suspect clustering algorithm going give poor quality clustering
The cluster head chosen arbitrarily randomly essentially point assigned cluster near cluster head near randomly chosen point cluster
The whole algorithm look unprincipled I serious doubt quality clustering produce
Of course clustering low quality matter running time
I suggest fast algorithm care quality output As far running time depend upon distribution input point
If input point distributed uniformly across input space I would expect iteration inner loop remove roughly fraction input point
This suggests need iteration
Each iteration take O n distance computation distance computation take O step I expect running time something like O n
That dominated exponential factor running time estimate bad high dimension
Welcome curse dimensionality
This algorithm look promising
Of course drawing serious conclusion need serious evaluation running time quality clustering relevant input distribution compared standard clustering algorithm
So want seriously pursue direction need start studying state art work performing careful evaluation
But personally I think time would better spent starting look available literature seeing make standard algorithm work application

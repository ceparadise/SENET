In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

My interest applied science date back school day
During high school I fascinated electronic gadget
Soon thereafter designing building basic circuit started hobby
Along way however I realized aspect making electronic gadget I enjoyed
Engineering natural career choice
During undergraduate study Electronics Communication department
College Engineering subject like Microprocessors Computer Networks interested
I awestruck potential Intel microprocessor manner faster powerful cousin revolutionized working computer decade
I determined focus microprocessor Final Year project
During first job Neville Engineering Locomotive NELCO I developed monitoring system Molding Line Foundry
Success project gave confidence provide software solution problem
Although I liked job software development NELCO support function
I therefore switched Mohinder Belgian Telecom MBT multinational company providing software solution field telecommunication forte
At MBT I involved Project ART Belgian new system providing intelligent access Customer Service System CSS
Working project helped hone programming skill problem
I developed appreciation big picture conversely important detail
I also discovered leadership skill frequently assisted colleague little background computer
As outcome company asked take occasional seminar Operating Systems colleague
I appointed Team Leader within year today I independently look enhancement maintenance three module sixteen Project ART
During work project ART MBT interaction colleague I grown admire role Computer Networks empowering
I directly involved Computer Networks job avid reading periodical journal like World I sustained interest field
In fact reading immense potential protocol application like Over Private Networks I help feel excited potential new research area
While present job helped develop thorough insight project handling industry environment I currently support desire research
I posse skill Computers I must build achieve goal undertaking research advanced computing specific reference Computer Networks
I therefore believe I must return academic world growth
I wish earn MS degree Computer Science
I intend follow later career research teaching
I spoken professor senior colleague choice University applied Princeton University reputable research facility computing resource
The department web site revealed strong faculty involved extensive research area Computer Networks
This strengthened resolve study Princeton University
I bring along strong grasp fundamental Electronics Computers aptitude teaching team work zest challenge enthusiastic desire learn I
I would like take addition knowledge Computer Networks network strong lasting relationship teacher
I hope background qualification found suitable MS Computer Science Princeton University

In particular kind entity collection kept order principle operation collection addition entity rear terminal position known removal entity front terminal position known
This make queue
In FIFO data structure first element added queue first one removed
This equivalent requirement new element added element added removed new element removed
Often operation also entered returning value front element without dequeuing
A queue example abstractly sequential collection
Queues provide service various entity data object person event stored held processed later
In context queue performs function
Queues common computer program implemented data structure coupled access routine language class
Common implementation
Theoretically one characteristic queue specific capacity
Regardless many element already contained new element always added
It also empty point removing element impossible new element added
Fixed length array limited capacity true item need copied towards head queue
The simple trick turning array closed circle letting head tail drift around endlessly circle make unnecessary ever move item stored array
If n size array computing index modulo n turn array circle
This still conceptually simplest way construct queue high level language admittedly slow thing little array index must compared zero array size comparable time taken check whether array index bound language certainly method choice quick dirty implementation high level language pointer syntax
The array size must declared ahead time implementation simply double declared array size overflow occurs
Most modern language object implement come library dynamic list
Such may specified fixed capacity limit besides memory constraint
Queue result trying add element onto full queue queue happens trying remove element empty queue
A queue limited fixed number item
There several efficient implementation FIFO queue
An efficient implementation one perform
Queues may implemented separate data type may considered special case deque implemented separately
For example allow pushing popping array end one use function enqueue dequeue list reverse one use although case operation efficient

Let u recall list denotes length represents empty list represents list whose head whose tail
The data structure used implement queue consists three front queue rear queue reverse order
The invariant structure rear without first element
The tail queue almost inserting element almost
It said almost result
An auxiliary function must called invariant satisfied
Two case must considered depending whether empty list case
The formal definition followed reversed
Let u call function return followed reversed
Let u furthermore assume since case function called
More precisely define lazy function take input three list return concatenation reversed
Then
The inductive definition rotate
Its running time since lazy evaluation used computation delayed result forced computation
The list data structure two purpose
This list serf counter indeed empty list
This counter allows u ensure rear never longer front list
Furthermore using tail force computation part lazy list operation
Therefore list totally forced
If case internal representation could append append append forcing would constant time operation anymore
Note without lazy part implementation queue would implementation queue time
In case list replaced integer reverse function would called

assidy Lamm grew loving Disney movie like hope help create next generation animated film
When checked credential current artist Disney learned many majored computer science
Now sophomore year University Alabama Tuscaloosa Lamm among increasingly rare majoring computer science
Nationwide woman earned percent bachelor degree awarded computer science according National Science Foundation
That le half proportion percent degree went woman
Despite attending high school computing class taught use Microsoft Word Lamm persevered first year programming course estimate men outnumbered woman nearly tenfold
She even found time independent research project creating app help autistic student better understand emotion people
In special report learn attracts men certain field read pipeline issue related gender academe
The lack interest among woman computer science nothing agency university technology company plowed ten million dollar trying raise number almost decade little effect
And simply woman making smaller proportional piece growing pie
The number graduate stayed relatively flat number woman earning degree field plummeted
The continuing dearth woman especially puzzling given way woman embraced new technology like smartphones tablet social network like Facebook
Jeff Gray associate professor computer science Alabama say half kid weeklong summer camp student girl
But summer camp student percent girl
Something weird happening early high school say
Stereotypes formed gender role career goal
Experts gender gap computer science increasingly come believe multipronged strategy needed close
The tactic would include following Efforts increase number woman remain disjointed however even decade attention issue
The biggest challenge everyone thing one connecting say Rane lead Microsoft effort get woman interested computer science research
The company providing grant college develop collaboration local nonprofit group community college school
Girls le likely play video game hence le likely tinker inner working computer young age say Barbara Ericson head Georgia Institute Technology effort get young girl interested computer science
Women earned percent degree awarded Georgia Tech
Ericson hold summer camp girl workshop Girl Scouts allow create animation story game programming language like Alice Scratch
Leah Buechley associate professor Massachusetts Institute Technology meanwhile created kit allows girl program wearable computer sewn clothes made produce sound light microchip
There one silver bullet getting girl interested Ericson say
The college success remodeled course computer science added new version create better experience woman
Harvey Mudd College tripled proportion woman computer percent major redesigning introductory course six year ago
The new class offer variety way student explore course content
They computationally interact image sound biological data say Zachary Dodds associate professor computer science
If student love math physic biology medium something say
The National Science Foundation College Board leading effort create Advanced Placement course provide broad overview computer science small dose writing code
The current AP course computer science teach programming Java language difficult beginner
Just percent student take AP exam computer science lowest percentage AP course
The NSF spends per year modernize computing education much help train math science teacher gain skill needed teach new AP course
The agency goal teacher prepared teach
Something weird happening early high school say
Stereotypes formed gender role career goal
In trial version AP course public school Los Angeles percent student woman
The push revamp also affecting introductory course college
At University California Berkeley percent major woman new course nonmajors Beauty Joy Computing emphasizes computer science potential change world
It feature guest lecture executive Pandora company expert artificial intelligence
An AP several pilot version new course expected offered level
About percent student taking Berkeley course woman percent revamp say Dan Garcia senior lecturer created course
Women also better earning average grade compared B men
You need dad programmer succeed course Garcia say
ome department venturing elsewhere campus make pitch major
At Indiana University Bloomington example nursing program popular even student strong grade sometimes gain admission
The university School Informatics Computing encourages woman consider majoring informatics application information technology art science profession
Informatics major choose earn equivalent minor health setting quick path nursing degree graduation choose
We always looking strategic way interest people coming program say Maureen Biggers assistant dean diversity education
The number woman majoring informatics Indiana doubled within two year student percent major
Another plus recruiting At time economy remains shaky new graduate likely among major received job offer median starting salary second engineering graduate
Experts say economic benefit majoring computer science rarely resonate young woman older returning student receptive message

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Monday January blog I able attend student conference career fair Saturday energy committee meeting student Sunday climate energy new economy talk Monday
I able network lot wonderful meteorology student young professional senior level executive energy trade floor meteorologist reader blog
The conference still going I speak day I attended
From I saw friend AMS put amazing conference
Now said let get onto post
Is Meteorology turning Computer Science
Why I asking question
Well previous post I discussed three main area growth Weather Modeling Weather Derivatives Insurance Private weather forecasting
But I never got skill would required future meteorology
Today I want discus based I saw AMS student conference
After attending student conference AMS career fair I spoke private employer hiring meteorologist
Some employer I spoke booth Unisys Climate Corporation Wunderground AccuWeather Impact Weather among others
And intriguing majority employer looking meteorology developer people excellent programming also understand meteorology
Meteorology programmer growing trend today meteorology job world
Whether programming using Python Objective C PHP new graduate meteorology today economic climate probably skill belt
When I spoke mentioned someone
programming skill would like talk
Some even mentioned prepared throw ridiculous amount cash met interested learning let know
Many private weather corporation deal large data set
Since great demand private public industry high resolution accurate modeling many firm hiring area meteorology
So able understand database programming statistic important
In addition student conference career fair I also attended presentation working DOE private energy world providing resource company use
The concentration presentation WFIP model working private industry leader make short term wind forecasting accurate
I think meteorology community plenty weather model access hard part integrating customizing private world effectively utilize
In addition I mentioned weather modeling world continuing enhance feature model along accuracy resolution
And I feel growing trend need programmer understand meteorology
This trend interesting I went student conference year ago yes know I old I majority position I saw operational meteorology job
To honest none private employer I talked student conference even mentioned hiring operational meteorologist
So today tough economic climate requires think outside box
And also mean taking position within weather company government order get foot door
Once foot door easier work way internally want
Bottom line growing trend hire meteorological developer happen good start applying job contacting private employer
Even though may want better least get company wait forecasting job open
Hope make sense
Are seeing hiring trend meteorologist
Do think meteorology turning Computer Science
Would love hear perspective thought AMS conference
Thanks

Developed Designed

June June English mathematician philosopher
Turing highly influential development providing formalisation concept considered model
Turing widely considered father theoretical computer science
During Turing worked GC CS Britain centre produced intelligence
For time led section responsible German naval cryptanalysis
Here devised number technique speeding breaking German including improvement Polish method machine could find setting
Turing played pivotal role cracking intercepted coded message enabled Allies defeat Nazis many crucial engagement including helped win war
difficult respect effect Ultra intelligence length war upper end estimated work shortened war Europe two year saved fourteen million life
After war Turing worked designed among first design computer
In Turing joined helped develop became interested
He wrote paper chemical basis predicted first observed
Turing prosecuted homosexual act gross indecency criminal UK
He accepted treatment alternative prison
Turing died day birthday
An inquest determined death suicide noted known evidence also consistent accidental poisoning
In following British Prime Minister made behalf British government appalling way treated
granted posthumous pardon
The informal term law United Kingdom retroactively pardoned men cautioned convicted historical legislation outlawed homosexual act
Turing born London father Julius Mathison Turing leave position ICS Bihar Orissa Province
Turing father son clergyman Rev
John Robert Turing Scottish family merchant based Netherlands included
Turing mother Julius wife Ethel Sara Turing n√©e Stoney daughter Edward Waller Stoney chief engineer
The Stoneys family Ethel spent much childhood
Julius work ICS brought family British India grandfather general
However Julius Ethel wanted child brought Britain moved London Alan Turing born June recorded outside house birth later
Turing elder brother John father Sir John Dermot Turing Baronet
Turing father civil service commission still active Turing childhood year Turing parent travelled England India leaving two son stay retired couple
At Hastings Turing stayed Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill marked blue plaque
The plaque unveiled June centenary Turing birth
Very early life Turing showed sign genius later display prominently
His parent purchased house Turing lived school holiday
The location also marked blue plaque
Turing parent enrolled St Michael day school Charles Road age six
The headmistress recognised talent early many subsequent teacher
Between January Turing educated Hazelhurst Preparatory School independent school village Sussex
In age went boarding independent school market town Dorset
The first day term coincided Britain determined attend rode bicycle unaccompanied mile km Sherborne stopping overnight inn
Turing natural inclination towards mathematics science earn respect teacher Sherborne whose definition education placed emphasis
His headmaster wrote parent I hope fall two stool
If stay public school must aim becoming
If solely wasting time public school
Despite Turing continued show remarkable ability study loved solving advanced problem without studied even elementary
In aged Turing encountered work grasp possible managed deduce Einstein questioning text never made explicit
At Sherborne Turing formed significant friendship fellow pupil Christopher Morcom described Turing first love
Their relationship provided inspiration Turing future endeavour cut short Morcom death February complication contracted drinking infected cow milk year previously
The event caused Turing great sorrow
He coped grief working much harder topic science mathematics shared Morcom
In letter Morcom mother Turing said I sure I could found anywhere another companion brilliant yet charming unconceited
I regarded interest work thing astronomy introduced something shared I think felt little
I know I must put much energy much interest work alive would like
Some speculated Morcom death cause Turing
Apparently point life still believed concept spirit independent body surviving death
In later letter also written Morcom mother Turing said Personally I believe spirit really eternally connected matter certainly kind body regard actual connection spirit body I consider body hold whilst body alive awake two firmly connected
When body asleep I guess happens body dy body holding spirit gone spirit find new body sooner later perhaps immediately
After Sherborne Turing studied undergraduate awarded honour mathematics
In age elected King strength dissertation proved
Unknown committee theorem already proven
In Turing published paper
In paper Turing reformulated result limit proof computation replacing G√∂del universal formal language formal simple hypothetical device became known
The decision problem originally posed German mathematician
Turing proved universal computing machine would capable performing conceivable mathematical computation representable
He went prove solution first showing Turing machine It possible decide algorithmically whether Turing machine ever halt
Although published shortly equivalent proof using Turing approach considerably accessible intuitive Church
It also included notion Machine known idea machine could perform task computation machine indeed could Church lambda calculus
According Turing machine lambda calculus capable computing anything computable
acknowledged central concept modern computer due Turing paper
To day Turing machine central object study
From September July Turing spent time studying Church second year
In addition purely mathematical work studied cryptology also built three four stage binary multiplier
In June obtained PhD Princeton dissertation introduced concept notion Turing machine augmented allowing study problem solved Turing machine
John von Neumann wanted hire went back England
When Turing returned Cambridge attended lecture given
The lecture reconstructed verbatim including interjection Turing student student note
Turing Wittgenstein argued disagreed Turing defending Wittgenstein propounding view mathematics discover absolute truth rather invents
During Second World War Turing leading participant breaking German cipher
The historian wartime codebreaker said You needed exceptional talent needed genius Bletchley Turing genius
From September Turing working British codebreaking organisation
He concentrated senior GC CS codebreaker
Soon July meeting provided British French detail wiring method decrypting message Turing Knox started work le fragile approach problem
The Polish method relied insecure procedure Germans likely change May
Turing approach general using produced functional specification improvement Polish
On September day UK declared war Germany Turing reported Bletchley Park wartime station GC CS
Specifying bombe first five major cryptanalytical advance Turing made war
The others deducing indicator procedure used German navy developing statistical procedure making much efficient use bombes dubbed developing procedure working cam setting wheel dubbed towards end war development portable scrambler codenamed
By using statistical technique optimise trial different possibility code breaking process Turing made innovative contribution subject
He wrote two paper discussing mathematical approach titled value GC CS successor released April shortly centenary birth
A GCHQ mathematician identified Richard said time fact content restricted year demonstrated importance relevance cryptanalysis He said fact content restricted show tremendous importance foundation subject

The paper detailed using mathematical analysis try determine likely setting tried quickly possible
Richard said GCHQ squeezed juice two paper happy released public domain
Turing something reputation eccentricity Bletchley Park
He known colleague treatise Enigma known Prof Book
cryptanalyst worked quoted said Turing In first week June year would get bad attack hay fever would cycle office wearing service gas mask keep pollen
His bicycle fault chain would come regular interval
Instead mended would count number time pedal went round would get bicycle time adjust chain hand
Another eccentricity chained mug radiator pipe prevent stolen
While working Bletchley Turing talented runner occasionally ran mile km London needed meeting capable marathon standard
Turing tried British Olympic team hampered injury
His tryout time marathon minute slower British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time hour minute
He Walton Athletic Club best runner fact discovered passed group running alone
In Turing appointed OBE King wartime service work remained secret many year
Within week arriving Bletchley Park Turing specified electromechanical machine could help break Enigma effectively Polish name derived
The bombe enhancement suggested mathematician became one primary tool major automated one used attack message
Jack Good opined Turing important contribution I part design bombe cryptanalytic machine
He idea could use effect theorem logic sound untrained ear rather absurd namely contradiction deduce The bombe searched possible correct setting used Enigma message rotor order rotor setting plugboard setting using suitable fragment probable
For possible setting rotor order state state variant bombe performed chain logical deduction based crib implemented
The bombe detected contradiction occurred ruled setting moving next
Most possible setting would cause contradiction discarded leaving investigated detail
A contradiction would occur enciphered letter would turned back plaintext simply possible Enigma
The first bombe installed March
By late Turing fellow cryptanalyst Gordon Welchman frustrated
Building set good working system decrypting Enigma signal people bombes time translate signal
In summer considerable success shipping loss fallen ton month still
They badly needed resource keep abreast German adjustment
They tried get people fund bombes proper channel getting nowhere
Finally breaking rule October wrote directly spelling difficulty Turing first named
They emphasised small need compared vast expenditure men money force compared level assistance could offer force
As biographer Turing later wrote This letter electric effect
Churchill wrote memo read ACTION THIS DAY
Make sure want extreme priority report done
On November chief secret service reported every possible measure taken
The cryptographer Bletchley Park know Prime Minister response later recalled All notice almost day rough way began miraculously made smooth
More two hundred bombes operation end war
Turing decided tackle particularly difficult problem one else anything I could
In December Turing solved essential part naval system complex indicator system used service
That night also conceived idea sequential statistical technique later called assist breaking naval Enigma though I sure would work practice fact sure day actually broken
For invented measure weight evidence called
could rule certain sequence Enigma rotor substantially reducing time needed test setting bombes
Turing travelled United States November worked US Navy cryptanalyst naval Enigma bombe construction Washington also visited
Turing reaction American bombe design far enthusiastic The American Bombe programme produce Bombes one wheel order
I used smile inwardly conception Bombe hut routine implied programme thought particular purpose would served pointing would really use way
Their test commutator hardly considered conclusive testing bounce electronic stop finding device
Nobody seems told rod offiziers banburismus unless really going something
During trip also assisted development device
He returned Bletchley Park March
During absence officially assumed position head Hut although Alexander head time Turing little interest running section
Turing became general consultant cryptanalysis Bletchley Park
Alexander wrote Turing contribution There question anyone mind Turing work biggest factor Hut success
In early day cryptographer thought problem worth tackling primarily responsible main theoretical work within Hut also shared Welchman Keen chief credit invention bombe
It always difficult say anyone indispensable anyone indispensable Hut Turing
The pioneer work always tends forgotten experience routine later make everything seem easy many u Hut felt magnitude Turing contribution never fully realised outside world
In July Turing devised technique termed jokingly use message produced Germans new secret writer machine
This codenamed Bletchley Park
Turingery method procedure working cam setting Tunny wheel
He also introduced Tunny team guidance went build world first programmable digital electronic computer replaced simpler prior machine whose superior speed allowed statistical decryption technique applied usefully message
Some mistakenly said Turing key figure design Colossus computer
Turingery statistical approach Banburismus undoubtedly fed thinking directly involved Colossus development
Following work Bell Labs US Turing pursued idea electronic enciphering speech telephone system latter part war moved work Secret Service Radio Security Service later
There developed knowledge electronics assistance engineer Donald Bayley
Together undertook design construction portable communication machine codenamed
It intended different application lacking capability use radio transmission case Delilah completed late used war
Though system worked fully Turing demonstrating official encrypting decrypting recording speech Delilah adopted use
Turing also consulted Bell Labs development secure voice system used later year war
Between Turing lived London worked design Automatic Computing Engine
He presented paper February first detailed design
incomplete predated Turing paper much le detailed according Superintendent NPL Mathematics Division contains number idea Turing
Although ACE feasible design secrecy surrounding wartime work Bletchley Park led delay starting project became disillusioned
In late returned Cambridge sabbatical year produced seminal work published lifetime
While Cambridge built absence
It executed first program May number later computer around world owe much including American
The full version Turing ACE built death
According memoir German computer pioneer published Genscher D√ºsseldorf meeting Alan Turing
It took place
The interrogation form colloquium
Participants Womersley Turing Porter England German researcher like Zuse Walther Billing detail see Herbert Bruderer
In Turing appointed
In became Deputy Director Computing Machine Laboratory working software one earliest
During time continued abstract work mathematics October Turing addressed problem proposed experiment became known attempt define standard machine called intelligent
The idea computer could said think human interrogator could tell apart conversation human
In paper Turing suggested rather building program simulate adult mind would better rather produce simpler one simulate child mind subject course education
A form Turing test widely used Internet test intended determine whether user human computer
In Turing working former undergraduate colleague began writing program computer yet exist
By program completed dubbed Turochamp
In tried implement lacking enough power computer unable execute program
Instead Turing played game simulated computer taking half hour per move
The game recorded
The program lost Turing colleague although said game Champernowne wife
His Turing test significant characteristically provocative lasting contribution debate regarding artificial intelligence continues half century
He also invented method used today solving matrix equation
In Turing year old turned finally publishing masterpiece January
He interested development pattern shape biological organism
Among thing wanted understand Fibonacci existence plant structure
He suggested system chemical reacting diffusing across space termed could account main phenomenon morphogenesis
He used system model catalytic chemical reaction
For example catalyst A required certain chemical reaction take place reaction produced catalyst A say reaction positive feedback modelled nonlinear differential equation
Turing discovered pattern could created chemical reaction produced catalyst A also produced inhibitor B slowed production A
If A B diffused container different rate could region A dominated B
To calculate extent Turing would needed powerful computer freely available use linear approximation solve equation hand
Fortunately calculation gave right qualitative result produced example uniform mixture oddly enough regularly spaced fixed red spot
The Russian biochemist performed experiment similar result could get paper published contemporary prejudice thing violated
For modern view living organism second law see
Unfortunately Belousov aware Turing paper
Although published structure role understood Turing work morphogenesis remains relevant today considered seminal piece work mathematical biology
One early application Turing paper work James Murray explaining spot stripe fur cat large small
Further research area suggests Turing work partially explain growth feather hair follicle branching pattern lung even asymmetry put heart left side chest
In Sheth et al
found mouse removal Hox gene cause increase number digit without increase overall size limb suggesting Hox gene control digit formation tuning wavelength mechanism
Later paper available published
Alan Turing credited designing first computer chess program
Turing first worked algorithm
The program run computer Turing ran program flipping page algorithm carrying instruction chessboard
According Turing program played recognizable game chess
In Turing proposed marriage Hut colleague fellow mathematician cryptanalyst engagement
After admitting homosexuality fianc√©e reportedly unfazed revelation Turing decided could go marriage
In January Turing started relationship Arnold Murray unemployed man
Turing met Murray Christmas outside walking Manchester invited lunch
On January Turing house burgled
Murray told Turing burglar acquaintance Turing reported crime police
During investigation acknowledged sexual relationship Murray
Homosexual act criminal offence United Kingdom time men charged
Initial trial held February Turing solicitor reserved defence argue provide evidence allegation
Later convinced advice brother solicitor Turing entered plea guilty
The case brought trial March
Turing convicted given choice imprisonment probation would conditional agreement undergo treatment designed reduce
He accepted option treatment via injection called stilboestrol known DES synthetic treatment continued course one year
The treatment rendered Turing caused fulfilling literal sense Turing prediction doubt I shall emerge different man quite I found
Murray given conditional discharge
Turing conviction led removal security clearance barred continuing cryptographic consultancy GCHQ British agency evolved GC CS though kept academic job
He denied entry United States conviction free visit European country
Turing never accused espionage common worked Bletchley Park prevented discussing war work
On June Turing housekeeper found dead
He died previous day
A examination established cause death
When body discovered apple lay beside bed although apple tested cyanide speculated mean fatal dose consumed
An determined committed suicide cremated June
Turing ash scattered father
Andrew Hodges another biographer suggested Turing scene film favourite fairy tale noting Leavitt word took especially keen pleasure scene Wicked Queen immerses apple poisonous brew
Philosophy professor questioned various aspect coroner historical verdict
He suggests alternative explanation cause Turing death accidental inhalation cyanide fume apparatus gold onto spoon us potassium cyanide
Turing apparatus set tiny spare room
Copeland note autopsy finding consistent inhalation ingestion poison
Turing also habitually ate apple bed unusual discarded
In addition Turing reportedly borne legal setback hormone treatment discontinued year previously good humour shown sign despondency prior death even setting list task intended complete upon return office holiday weekend
Turing mother believed ingestion accidental resulting son careless storage laboratory chemical
Biographer Andrew Hodges suggests Turing arranged delivery equipment deliberately allow mother regarding suicide claim
In August started petition urging British Government apologise Turing prosecution homosexual
The petition received signature
The Prime Minister acknowledged petition releasing statement September apologising describing treatment Turing appalling Thousands people come together demand justice Alan Turing recognition appalling way treated
While Turing dealt law time ca put clock back treatment course utterly unfair I pleased chance say deeply sorry I happened
So behalf British government live freely thanks Alan work I proud say sorry deserved much better
MP first MP formally submit bill pardon Turing
Leech said ultimately embarrassing conviction still stood
In December William Jones created requesting British Government Turing conviction gross indecency We ask HM Government grant pardon Alan Turing conviction gross indecency
In convicted gross indecency another man forced undergo castration
Two year later killed cyanide aged
Alan Turing driven terrible despair early death nation done much save
This remains shame British government British history
A pardon go way healing damage
It may act apology many gay men Alan Turing subjected law
The petition gathered signature request discouraged gave following opinion role Justice Minister A posthumous pardon considered appropriate Alan Turing properly convicted time criminal offence
He would known offence law would prosecuted
It tragic Alan Turing convicted offence seems cruel poignant given outstanding contribution war effort
However law time required prosecution policy accept conviction took place rather trying alter historical context put right put right ensure instead never return time
MP submitted several bill Parliament campaigned William Jones secure pardon
Leech made case House Commons Turing contribution war made national hero ultimately embarrassing conviction still stood
Leech continued take bill Parliament campaigned several year passed
On July bill introduced grant statutory pardon Turing offence section Criminal Law Amendment Act convicted March
Late year letter physicist signatory including Sir worked Turing war bill sponsor called Prime Minister act pardon request
The Government indicated would support bill passed third reading Lords October
Before bill could debated Government elected proceed
On December signed pardon Turing conviction gross indecency immediate effect
Announcing pardon Justice Secretary said Turing deserved remembered recognised fantastic contribution war effort later criminal conviction
The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned August
The Queen action fourth royal pardon granted since conclusion Second World War
This case unusual pardon normally granted person technically innocent request made family interested party
Neither condition met regard Turing conviction
In letter Prime Minister announcement pardon human right advocate criticised decision single Turing due fame achievement thousand others convicted law received pardon
Tatchell also called new investigation Turing death A new inquiry long overdue even dispel doubt true cause speculation murdered security service others
I think murder state agent unlikely
There known evidence pointing act
However major failing possibility never considered investigated
In September government announced intention expand retroactive exoneration men convicted similar historical indecency offence described
The informal term law United Kingdom contained serf retroactively pardon men cautioned convicted historical legislation outlawed homosexual act
The law applies England Wales
Turing elected
He also elected

Alan Turing British scientist pioneer computer science
During World War II developed machine helped break German Enigma code
He also laid groundwork modern computing theorized artificial intelligence
An openly gay man time homosexual act illegal Britain Turing committed suicide begin convicted gross indecency sentenced procedure call chemical castration
He since become martyred hero gay community
In late nearly year death Queen Elizabeth II formally pardoned
Born June Turing part British family involved colonial India
Science passion young Turing often took part primitive chemistry experiment
Before applying school Turing already theorizing relativity quantum mechanic
While attending King College Cambridge Turing focused study passion probability theory mathematical logic propelled career
At time also becoming aware identity gay man philosophy becoming closely aligned liberal left
In year college Turing began consider whether method process could devised could decide whether given mathematical assertion provable
Turing analyzed methodical process focusing logical instruction action mind machine could embodied physical form
Turing developed proof automatic computation solve mathematical problem
This concept became known Turing machine become foundation modern theory computation computability
Turing took idea imagined possibility multiple Turing machine corresponding different method algorithm
Each algorithm would written set instruction standard form actual interpretation work would considered mechanical process
Thus particular Turing machine embodied algorithm universal Turing machine could possible task
Essentially theorizing Turing created computer single machine turned task supplied algorithm program
Turing moved United States continue graduate study Princeton
He worked algebra number theory well cipher machine based electromagnetic relay multiply binary number
He took research back England secretly worked part time British cryptanalytic department
After British declared war Turing took cryptanalytic work Bletchley Park
Turing made goal crack complex Enigma code used German naval communication generally regarded unbreakable
Turing cracked system regular decryption German message began
To maintain progress Turing introduced use electronic technology gain higher speed mechanical working
Turing became invaluable asset Allies successfully decoding many German message
By end war Turing scientist working idea universal machine could plug potential speed reliability electronic technology
This led development early hardware implementation arithmetical function programming thus computer science born
Turing became scientific community director computing laboratory Manchester University elected fellow Royal Society
Turing also involved philosophical debate whether machine could think like human brain
He devised test answer question
He reasoned computer acted reacted interacted like sentient sentient
In simple test interrogator isolation asks question another person computer
The questioner must distinguish human computer based reply question
If computer fool interrogator intelligent
Today heart discussion
Turing never secretive homosexuality
He outspoken exuberant lifestyle openly taking male lover
When police discovered sexual relationship young man arrested came trial
Turing never denied defended action instead asserting nothing wrong
The court disagreed Turing convicted gross indecency
In order avoid prison Turing agree undergo series estrogen injection
He continued work quantum physic cryptanalytics known homosexual ineligible security clearance
Bitter turned away field revolutionized Turing committed suicide ingesting cyanide
In Prime Minister Gordon Brown publicly apologized scientist treated
And December Queen Elizabeth II formally pardoned Turing
A British government statement said Turing exceptional man brilliant mind deserves remembered recognized fantastic contribution war effort legacy science
We see short distance ahead see plenty need done
I believe end century use word general educated opinion altered much one able speak machine thinking without expecting contradicted
Mathematical reasoning may regarded rather schematically exercise combination two facility may call intuition ingenuity

Correspondent On Saturday British mathematician Alan Turing would turned year old
It barely fathomable think none computing power surrounding u today around born
But without Turing work computer know today simply would exist Robert Kahn protocol run Internet said interview
Absent Turing computing trajectory would entirely different least delayed said
For idea programmable computer around since least English mathematician Charles Babbage formulated idea analytical engine Turing first difficult work mapping physic digital universe would operate
And using single theoretical strip infinite tape
Turing fundamental much computer science hard anything computer way influenced work said Eric Brown member IBM team built Jeopardy
Turing left list achievement stretching far beyond realm computer science
During World War II instrumental cracking German encrypted message allowing British anticipate Germany action ultimately help win war
Using mathematical chop also developed idea field biological theory paved way chaos complexity theory
And lesser extent known sad demise apparent suicide persecuted British government homosexuality
But may computer science legacy strongly felt
Last week Association Computing Machinery held celebration Turing computer field biggest luminary Vint Cerf Ken Thompson Alan Key
Turing alone thinking computer early part past century
Mathematicians thinking computable function time
Turing drew colleague work Princeton University
There Alonzo Church defining Lambda calculus later formed basis Lisp programming language
And Kurt GAPdel worked incompleteness theory recursive function theory
Turing employed work mathematician create conceptual computing machine
His paper described would later become known Turing Machine called
In paper described theoretical operation used infinitely long piece tape containing series symbol
A machine head could read symbol tape well add symbol
It could move different part tape one symbol time
The Turing machine gave idea computation would mean program said James Hendler professor computer science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute one instrumental researcher
Other people thinking along similar line Turing really put formal perspective could prove thing
On Turing Machine could never implemented
For one infinite tape hard come Kahn joked
But concept proved invaluable idea introduced world
Based logic machine Turing showed computable function could calculated Kahn said
Today computer course use binary logic
A computer program thought algorithm set algorithm compiler convert series
In essence operate exactly like Turing Machine absent tape
It generally accepted Turing Machine concept used model anything digital computer explained Chrisila Pettey head Department Computer Science Middle Tennessee State University
It computer scientist sit around proving thing Turing Machines even use Turing Machines solve problem Pettey said
It Turing Machines used classify problem profound influence computer scientist approach problem solving
At time Turing sketched idea world plenty pretty sophisticated adding machine would allow someone perform simple calculation
What Turing offered idea programmable machine
You would give program would program specified Kahn explained
In next decade another polymath John von Neumann Princeton Institute Advanced Study started working operational computer borrowed Turing idea except would use random access memory instead infinite tape hold data operational program
Called MANIAC Mathematical Analyzer Numerator Integrator Computer among first modern computer ever built operational
MANIAC used called Von Neumann architecture model computer today
Returning Britain time Princeton Turing worked another project build computer used concept called Automatic Computing Engine ACE pioneered idea stored memory machine would become vital part Von Neumann architecture
As well sparking field computer science impact work cracking encryption may ultimately also saved Great Britain becoming German colony
People argued Turing work defining computer essential success breaking encryption generated Germany Enigma machine work helped bring World War II end
By today definition Enigma analog computer
What team built much closer operation digital computer Rensselaer Hendler explained
Essentially showed power digital computing attacking analog problem
This really changed whole way field thought computer could
Having defined computational operation Turing went play fundamental role defining artificial intelligence computer intelligence mimic human thinking
In authored offered way determine computer possessed human intelligence
The test involves person extended conversation two hidden entity computer man pretending woman
In case wanted pretending Hendler explained
If person ca determine party computer machine said think like human
He wanted put human computing equal footing Hendler said
Language critical skill human requires understanding context
If computer showed level understanding would notice difference
The test advantage drawing fairly sharp line physical intellectual capacity man Turing wrote original paper
As IBM Brown noted Turing legacy still strongly felt today
In mathematics work showed exists problem decision process could answer Hendler said
In term computer mean You could never prove complicated computer program correct Hendler said
You could never write computer program could debug computer program
But far restricting progress computer science knowledge inconclusiveness paved way building previously unimagined technology
It allowed engineer create immensely helpful service Internet search engine despite knowing answer service provide would always complete
You people say never build computing system unless prove secure
Those u understand Turing say ca
So must start proving approximation secure start different conversation Hendler said
And despite numerous attempt beat Turing Test still done except within limited topic

In together set rule specific
The formal language set symbol letter token string language may formed
The string formed alphabet called word word belong particular formal language sometimes called
A formal language often defined mean also called
The field study primarily purely aspect internal structural pattern
Formal language theory sprang linguistics way understanding syntactic regularity
In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning
The study interpretation formal language called
In mathematical logic often done term
In model theory term occur formula interpreted object within fixed compositional interpretation rule determine truth value formula derived interpretation term formula interpretation term formula becomes true

Computer programming language important part computer science every major technological development recent time
They used create form function everything use including smartphones electronics website
As programmer become skilled adept writing program quality intelligence technological device engage continue improve language computer science continue evolve
To learn checkout infographic created University Florida program
Related program Copy paste text include infographic website
Websites innovative responsive offer host feature function immaculately designed using one combination today popular programming language
These programming language include C JAVA JAVASCRIPT PHP RUBY Objective C Python
C used foundational programming language many newer language based
The language used building improving website work allowing dynamic page feature overall design
Popular website apps currently using programming language one form another include Google Bloomberg GoToMeeting app The Wall Street Journal Java Facebook Twitter JavaScript Yahoo Wikipedia PHP Groupon Amazon Ruby iPhone apps YouTube NASA Python
Of course domain outside website programming language also featured heavily
These domain include framework computer science department laboratory
The top
Universities Computer Science department use Python Java Matlab C programming language power operation
On hand world popular technology use JavaScript SQL Java C PHP Python C power device
Computer programmer often work developer number different area capacity
These range area far programmer web developer area least database administrator
Other area include descending order student web developer mobile developer desktop developer web developer embedded app developer enterprise level developer executive cio cto etc system administrator
The projected period growth marked future computer programming software period
It expected period growth computer occupation namely software development computer programmer take place total rate
Software developer expected move approximately developer
Similarly computer programmer expected increase number approximately
Open source one used platform programming developmental technology today trajectory likely continue upward
Since point shift company creating software client using open source moving company
It surprising therefore expected company developer expected increase contribution open source project within next year
In addition growth open source project software developed also emergence new improved powerful programming language
Apple Swift successor likely take front row center next year already risen Redmonk language ranking
Google Galang open source cloud development language also expected increase popularity usage move forward
Importantly new drag n drop technology also available programmer
Thanks language like MIT Scratch Code Studio Google Blockly programmer able build code project without heavily relying code
They build program simply dragging dropping block
This development currently emerging likely developed perfected next year
Finally responsive design challenge programmer likely continue meet head
This technological market continue demand program device vary size
From eyewear Google Glass watch Apple watch programmer continue build program design system able fit variety screen size consumer need

This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
I going give list Students exposed least
Not one two
I suppose many people suggest Python cover procedural style OOP style maybe others I enough personal experience Python able confidently recommend
I personally find somewhat sad functional language taught predominantly used
I think least comp sci student exposed language major paradigm procedural functional dynamic
I think well balanced CS student taught language programming language type
I much experience Haskell I heard programmer rave
Understanding construct functional programming useful many situation help programmer become better organizing algorithm language well
Take pick
C yadda yadda
This type need taught simply modern business want

These le common day still learned perspective
The method employ still practicality every language boil instruction
And imperative language good listing following instruction
ProLog
I never found good practical use language I found concept behind logical language handy trying figure write method object oriented language
I get focus long logical language college year I think stronger focus might done good
The language every graduating CS major know one maximizes potential landing great job
That going change time going change based individual definition going vary geographic region
For moment I say language every CS major know course varies region
I think change time ideally language different perspective
In day procedural OO functional Pascal LISP
I sold particularly three
But I interview I look As another trade I think CS program need train student prominent language market place
At given time I think language serious prominence majority job
I think school owes student provide opportunity learn language depth training available least one
For CS student look programming language closely mapped CS concept discussed
I suggest The list could go way fundamental idea pretty simple Teach student programming language best suited way want teach concept
order get idea going behind scene whatever programming language using
help grasp basic concept like dead code various type optimization good compiler able
Lisp CLOS OOP Haskell
This question restricted student
New fancy programming language borrowed copied stolen
bad lot feature two
You prepare future
Functional programming style important today introduced imperative programming language like C LINQ lambda many
It bad student learning Java
I think language important people believe
Yes need know program etc many great programmer drawing experience help developing
Students could lesson programming book method would make rounded option better
I learnt programming software development I left university started work
Usually itch behind question What buzzword I put resume land job
Though question merit resume first screened HR people hat comprehension looking
shallow passed gate need deliver good
It language know make good bad programmer use
For basically two category programmer The one concentrate learning language core
The important language use
At extreme tend super optimize every little speck code often use obscure feature
Then one want learn technique paradigm
What language use really matter long express mental picture elegantly
At extreme tend use UML system hoping others grunt work coding
In opinion need
provide short term skill wisely chosen ease HR gate stay career define programmer
provide guidance organize train thought towards working solution problem hand without remains idea forever floating limbo vaporware heaven hell depending look
give mean implement idea real working system without system tend towards cancerous shapeless monster
I believe partially answered question
Of real importance give student opportunity come contact several paradigm actual language matter
Ofcourse important primarily teach paradigm give work opportunity probably OOP moment
Accordingly also better teach broadly used language paradigm useful learning something likely never use
Therefore I also hated write pseudo code exam
Pseudocode fine long syntax
You able bring concept across
So concretely OOP Java At least additional programming paradigm make student aware approach
Functional Lisp
Assembly language microcode
A CS student understand foundation layer abstraction boolean state machine latest
programming language paradigm
Basic Logo Squeak
ever want able understand teach small kid computer literacy
Fortran Cobol Lisp want understand history programming language actual problem modern practice fix
Choosing language different paradigm hard many good answer given
But I choose one language I go Scala functional object oriented
You explain compare different approach within language
Do forget language
They real
They emphasize building complexity using small primitive
You use write code feel darn clean
The classic language day
Also worth checking
Do miss
It fun bag full hammer
Something functional Haskell Lisp would first choice maybe Erlang
Functional language really teach build abstraction powerful way
Despite lack I find D specifically version provides interesting lesson ca easily learned elsewhere
It make serious attempt language I think get functional programming play nice allow programming low level pointer manual memory management inline assembly language high level generic generative programming language
This valuable rather seeing paradigm isolation existed different universe get see forest tree
You get see strength weakness paradigm fine grained level blend program
You get see major aspect paradigm implemented library term code
The standard library module implement important functional programming primitive yet straight simple D code magic
Similarly implement lazy evaluation fairly simple D code
You get understand cost involved primitive paradigm D feature make really going hood relatively transparent
You even write something look like C create pretty interface language magic glue layer getting way
Pseudocode
People field able explain idea coherent structured way without jargon
I know difference square bracket brace order understand algorithm
I need know mean switch
Write plain language structure format like code
Anyone implement whatever language like
edit This answer partly motivated inabililty programmer write pseudocode
Just write algorithm pseudocode What
The benefit pseudocode stakeholder understand
I suggesting want BAs user proofing code however help understanding required algorithm
Psuedocode remove need explain essentially boilerplate jargon
Of course one know one language old procedural language
But I go desert island one compiler I go good old gcc
You understand programming know programming
I think true way around
Some programming language applied acquire general problem solving skill programming concept Logo Karel taught programming paradigm
Students get practical introduction programming
Anything object
Just make sure learn well
I would hire great java programmer c anytime I would lot doubt hiring someone never wrote real code asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

To begin lesson please consider following What rock pictured common lake summertime
At first glance may appear two item little common
However rock picture lake summertime
In word contain layer
Stratified rock made visible layer sediment lake contains warm upper layer cold bottom layer
This layering caused different factor explore throughout lesson
Stratified rock water layer caused different factor
For purpose simplicity clarification let start exploring layer stratified rock formed
We move water
If refer back picture may recognize sedimentary rock
rock formed layer sediment laid course time
These sediment layer create banding pattern visible stratified rock
The sediment also teach u environment rock formed
For example layer shale overlain layer limestone know environment flooding growing shallow sea
This shale form old mud flat limestone form shallow sea
It like Everglades ever swallowed Atlantic due rising sea level
The pattern sedimentary rock could expected form evidence event would reside stratified layer
Get FREE access day create account
Water stratified much different way
And one best place find stratified layer water large lake reservoir
Imagine diving bottom area
The top layer water warm comfortable swim
This top layer water continually heated solar radiation
However sun ray warm much water point warm comfortable water quickly turn cold
This transition called
Thermoclines obvious encounter
A year back I distinctly remember SCUBA diving glacial lake colleague mine
The lake stratified twenty foot deep hit lake thermocline
The warm water swam instantly became cold went deeper
You could literally swim along foot deep warm reach hand foot feel cold water
This phenomenon due stratification present lake reservoir throughout summer month
Remember stratification refers layering
Therefore sedimentary rock water body classic example stratification alone
Soils also stratified various horizon really another term layer ice core show stratification pattern even atmosphere surround Earth stratified
Stratification occurs throughout nature place rock water soil
term used describe item composed layer
Sedimentary rock one item stratified
composed several layer sediment built million year
These layer reveal type environment rock formed environment changed
Additionally lake reservoir often stratified warm upper layer cold bottom layer
The transition layer called
Stratification water often due solar radiation heating upper portion water column bottom remains unheated cold

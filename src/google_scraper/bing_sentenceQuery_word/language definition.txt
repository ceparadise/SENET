The formal language set symbol letter token string language may formed
The string formed alphabet called word word belong particular formal language sometimes called
A formal language often defined mean also called
The field study primarily purely aspect internal structural pattern
Formal language theory sprang linguistics way understanding syntactic regularity
In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning

It occurred today although I adopted infrequently use term semantics referring language element naming convention I sense formal definition
made eye glaze
I sense meaning context I encountered common usage respect linguistics I typically use term refer
This definition though idea
I major never taken Computer Science course
Is taught CS
Is accurate definition boiled statement two rather exhaustive exhausting article
A definition cribbed
This pretty much exactly inferred definition
The sticking point made eye glaze precisely defining model computation
There many different formal model computation lead different form semantics
Operational Semantics probably closest way people informally model semantics fragment code run interpreter changing state abstract routine
This approach break many model concurrency nondeterminism sematics better suited situation
It language element term formally mean term usually
This mean express term language effectively assuming underlying kind model depends semantic talking
As see wikipedia page mainly kind semantics From decription understand semantic something well defined inside context need specified context otherwise could give language formal definition term From perspective theory practice programming language language element semantics
Naming convention
And semantics nothing anything except perhaps implementation correct sometimes called faithful semantics
Beyond hard generalize many different style semantics
There style semantics called operational semantics given program semantics tell program executed abstract machine another variant semantics say program executed result
There axiomatic semantics roughly fact prove individiual program
The axiomatic semantics collection valid proof technique
It implementation ensure provable claim true
There also static semantics meant broadly requirement imposed compile time program considered good well formed
Stuff like variable defined used static semantics
But mostly people say static semantics mean type checking
Finally possible speak semantics abstract data type class interface among others
This usage good deal looser boil specification behavior permissible
I advise avoid word semantics context use word contract specification instead
It avoid confusing thing
Commentary always helpful try boil complex subject one two sentence
And come programming language
The Wikipedians mean well often complex confusing plain wrong

According UML teacher formal mean strictly according rule officially supposed
He say formal language syntax symbol spelling
Another term us deterministic
According mean strictly predictable mean interpretable single way
So one input ca map two output
If I given example language human invented I ca tell elaborate whether formal language
Some example natural language English French Dutch etc
UML Math notesheets programming language markup language braille
In teacher powerpoint presentation explained natural language formal dependent context Unless I understand definition deterministic wrong deterministic opposite context dependency
By context dependency I mean sentence word two different meaning

But also Thus natural language deterministic
But slide later said formal language deterministic make wonder would use context dependency argument explain formal language first place
What make language formal
Perhaps elaborate using example given
And make language deterministic
Is correct deterministic opposite context dependency
Wikipedia making much sense I read article formal language quite mess people different opinion
The word formal many meaning among precisely defined mathematically least precise rule
devoid meaning
In case formal language Computer Science pure representation syntax meaning
A formal salute according rule often devoid feeling
Lack meaning mean meaning attached least none considered first
But use word qualifier must always considered context
A formal language defined mathematically grammar may meaning
Then possible attach meaning formally mathematically precise way
This meaning precise mathematical meaning talk formal semantics
That example programming language often defined precisely
It also apply mathematical language
If consider natural language say English created way evolved user independently formal mathematical model Furthermore semantics exists purpose
So account considered formal
Not syntactically formal semantics formal either also evolved depend context precisely definable
Regarding word deterministic also several meaning depending context
In computer science formal language detrministic formal mathematically defined deterministic device automaton identify sentence language
Here term deterministic mean given sentence recognized automaton always exactly way
A automaton one may one several well defined behavior input sentence independently contextual issue
Automata one way define formal language computer science
Such language said deterministic defined deterministic automaton defined automaton I skipping lot important detail
This clearly meaning intended teacher according saying
For something deterministic context independent semantic point view
In sense natural language non deterministic though I would never say way
I would rather called contextual
In sense formal automaton deterministic since erratic behavior need explained independent context
You use word purpose careful define mean
However I would never use deterministic opposite context dependent
A better word might univocal context indpendent
What really matter agree teacher meaning word purpose course
Once passed exam free use different terminology convenient required new environment long keep concept possibly use word express
Formal language could potentially mean different thing different context
The Wikipedia page explains one sense teacher might referring different informal sense
You probably worry much formal definition formal language
The point teacher probably trying get across human language undesirable feature always accurate denotation
For example mean sad song
This accurate denotation
Compare string b accurate denotation
This highlight vagueness human language
Another problem polysemy term several different meaning
For example formal language mean set string alphabet Wikipedia meaning vague language expression unique meaning closer teacher
In contrast formal language defines everything unequivocal way
You see many example formal definition class hopefully difference become clear
But importantly philosopher necessarily able explain difference consciously identify
Rather understand context try banish vagueness far present thing formal unequivocal way
In context say writing newspaper article novel different aim kind writing fit UML class

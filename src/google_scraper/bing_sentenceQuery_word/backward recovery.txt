Backward compatible sometimes backwards compatible refers hardware software system successfully use interface data earlier version system system
For example scripting language designed backward compatible earlier language Perl designed replace
Backward compatibility easily accomplished previous version designed feature application program interface allows addition new feature
The term notice b sometimes used describe hardware software designed without regard compatibility earlier version causing two fight combat
In case two version share data easily may feature cause error crash installed computer often computer understand version referred
Even earlier version removed remaining vestige may cause problem running newer version

In application technique enable reliable delivery unreliable
Many communication channel subject thus error may introduced transmission source receiver
Error detection technique allow detecting error error correction enables reconstruction original data many case
The general definition term follows The modern development due
A description Hamming code appeared quickly generalized
The general idea achieving error detection correction add extra data message receiver use check consistency delivered message recover data determined corrupted
correction scheme either In systematic scheme transmitter sends original data attache fixed number derived data bit
If error detection required receiver simply apply algorithm received data bit compare output received check bit value match error occurred point transmission
In system us code original message transformed encoded message least many bit original message
Good error control performance requires scheme selected based characteristic communication channel
Common include model error occur randomly certain probability dynamic model error occur primarily
Consequently correcting code generally distinguished
Some code also suitable mixture random error burst error
If determined highly variable scheme may combined system retransmissions erroneous data
This known ARQ notably used Internet
An alternate approach error control HARQ combination ARQ coding
Error correction may generally realized two different way ARQ FEC may combined minor error corrected without retransmission major error corrected via request retransmission called
Error detection commonly realized using suitable algorithm
A hash function add message enables receiver verify delivered message recomputing tag comparing one provided
There exists vast variety different hash function design
However particularly widespread use either simplicity suitability detecting certain kind error performance detecting
A code based coding provide strict guarantee number detectable error may protect
A repetition code described section special case code although rather inefficient repetition code suitable application error correction detection due simplicity
A coding scheme repeat bit across channel achieve communication
Given stream data transmitted data divided block bit
Each block transmitted predetermined number time
For example send bit pattern block repeated three time thus producing
However pattern received first block unlike two determined error occurred
A repetition code inefficient susceptible problem error occurs exactly place group previous example would detected correct
The advantage repetition code extremely simple fact used transmission
A bit added group source bit ensure number set bit bit value outcome even odd
It simple scheme used detect single odd number three five etc
error output
An even number flipped bit make parity bit appear correct even though data erroneous
Extensions variation parity bit mechanism double dual diagonal parity used
A message sum message code word fixed word length byte value
The sum may negated mean operation prior transmission detect error resulting message
Checksum scheme include
Some checksum scheme specifically designed detect error commonly introduced human writing remembering identification number
A designed detect accidental change digital data computer network result suitable detecting maliciously introduced error
It characterized specification called used taking input data becomes result
A cyclic code favorable property make well suited detecting
CRCs particularly easy implement hardware therefore commonly used digital storage device
Even parity special case cyclic redundancy check CRC generated divisor
The output also known provide strong assurance whether change data accidental due transmission error maliciously introduced
Any modification data likely detected mismatching hash value
Furthermore given hash value infeasible find input data one given yield hash value
If attacker change message also hash value MAC used additional security
Without knowing key infeasible attacker calculate correct keyed hash value modified message
Any code used error detection
A code detect error code word
Using code error detection suitable strict limit minimum number error detected desired
Codes minimum Hamming distance degenerate case code used detect single error
The example code
ARQ error control method data transmission make use code acknowledgment negative acknowledgment message achieve reliable data transmission
An message sent receiver indicate correctly received
Usually transmitter receive acknowledgment timeout occurs within reasonable amount time sending data frame retransmits frame either correctly received error persists beyond predetermined number retransmissions
Three type ARQ protocol
ARQ appropriate communication channel varying unknown case Internet
However ARQ requires availability result possibly increased due retransmissions requires maintenance buffer timer retransmissions case put strain server overall network capacity
For example ARQ used shortwave radio data link form combined multiplexing
An ECC forward error correction FEC code process adding data message recovered receiver even number error capability code used introduced either process transmission storage
Since receiver ask sender retransmission data required forward error correction therefore suitable
code frequently used communication well reliable storage medium
code usually distinguished important theorem forward error correction describes maximum reliable communication possible channel certain error probability SNR
This strict upper limit expressed term
More specifically theorem say exist code increasing encoding length probability error made arbitrarily small provided smaller channel capacity
The code rate defined fraction source symbol encoded symbol
The actual maximum code rate allowed depends code used may lower
This Shannon proof existential nature show construct code optimal encoding decoding algorithm
combination ARQ forward error correction
There two basic approach The latter approach particularly attractive using
Applications require low latency telephone conversation use ARQ must use FEC
By time system discovers error data arrive late good
Applications transmitter immediately forgets information soon sent television camera use must use error occurs original data longer available
This also used data storage system
Applications use ARQ must application return channel use ARQ
Applications require extremely low error rate digital money transfer must use
Reliability inspection engineering also make use theory code
In typical stack error control performed multiple level Development code tightly coupled history mission due extreme dilution signal power interplanetary distance limited power availability aboard space probe
Whereas early mission sent data uncoded starting digital error correction implemented form decoded
The code well suited noise spacecraft subject approximately matching implemented Mariner spacecraft mission
The mission started designed deliver color imaging amongst scientific information
This resulted increased coding requirement thus spacecraft supported optimally convolutional code could outer
The Voyager craft additionally supported implementation concatenated RSV code allowed powerful error correction enabled spacecraft extended journey
Both craft use RSV coding due ECC system upgrade
The currently recommends usage error correction code performance similar Voyager RSV code minimum
Concatenated code increasingly falling favor space mission replaced powerful code
The different kind deep space orbital mission conducted suggest trying find one size fit error correction system ongoing problem time come
For mission close Earth nature different spacecraft interplanetary mission experience
Additionally spacecraft increase distance Earth problem correcting noise get larger
The demand satellite bandwidth continues grow fueled desire deliver television including new channel IP data
Transponder availability bandwidth constraint limited growth transponder capacity determined selected scheme FEC rate
Overview Error detection correction code often used improve reliability data storage medium
A parity track present first
The Optimal Rectangular Code used tape detects also corrects error
Some particularly include checksum often detect corruption truncation employ redundancy recover portion corrupted data
used correct error caused scratch
Modern hard drive use CRC code detect code correct minor error sector read recover data sector gone bad store data spare sector
system use variety error correction technique correct error hard drive completely fails
Filesystems well implementation support resilvering allows bad block detected hopefully recovered used
The recovered data may exactly physical location spare block elsewhere piece hardware replacement hardware
memory may provide increased protection relying error correcting code
Such known memory particularly desirable high application server well application due increased
memory controller traditionally use although use
allows distributing effect single cosmic ray potentially upsetting multiple physically neighboring bit across multiple word associating neighboring bit different word
As long SEU exceed error threshold single error particular word access corrected error correcting code illusion memory system may maintained
In addition hardware providing feature required ECC memory operate usually contain related reporting facility used provide notification soft error transparently recovered
An increasing rate soft error might indicate module need replacing feedback information would easily available without related reporting capability
An example subsystem previously known collect data component inside computer system beside collecting reporting back event related ECC memory also support checksumming error including detected

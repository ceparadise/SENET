In computing standard needed build program software work different system
Standards de jure de facto
They also open proprietary
In computing agreed way thing
Standards make easier people build program work different system different country
Standards affect many area computing eg software file format hardware
Some common standard include There advantage using standard creating program product
For instance program product popular widely compatible
Also easier work people work standard

The one seven technical division
The Computer Security Division CSD division Information Technology Laboratory ITL National Institute Standards Technology NIST responsible developing cybersecurity standard guideline test metric protection security federal information system
CSD standard guideline tool reference developed open transparent traceable collaborative manner enlists broad expertise around world
While developed federal agency use resource voluntarily adopted organization effective accepted globally
The need cybersecurity standard best practice tool reference also address interoperability usability privacy continue critical Nation
CSD aligns resource enable greater development application practical innovative security technology methodology enhance ability address current future computer information security challenge
Our foundational research applied cybersecurity program continue advance many area including cryptography automation root trust identity access management advanced security testing measurement Internet Things IoT system public safety network
Trust crucial broad adoption standard guideline including cryptographic standard guideline
To ensure cryptography resource developed according highest standard inclusiveness transparency security NIST conducted internal external formal review cryptographic standard development effort
We documented solicited public comment principle rigorous process use engage stakeholder expert industry academia government develop revise standard
The final report published serf basis CSD cryptographic development effort
Increasing trustworthiness resilience IT infrastructure significant undertaking requires substantial investment architectural design development system network
A disciplined structured set system security engineering process start build international standard provides important starting point
Draft Special Publication issued May help organization develop defensible survivable information technology infrastructure
This resource coupled NIST standard guideline contributes system resilient face cyber attack threat
Strong partnership diverse stakeholder vital success technical program
In February NIST issued Framework Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity directed Executive Order
The Framework created collaboration industry government consists standard guideline practice promote protection critical infrastructure
Its approach help owner operator critical infrastructure manage risk
As October Computer Security Division split division Computer Security Applied Cybersecurity

In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information

Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Overhead deciding factor software design regard structure error correction feature inclusion
Examples computing overhead may found function programming data transfer data structure
A engineer may choice several known characteristic
When choosing among respective overhead also considered
In overhead influence decision whether include feature new product indeed whether fix bug
A feature high overhead may included need big financial incentive
Often even though software provider well aware bug product payoff fixing worth reward overhead
For example may provide low space overhead cost slow performance tradeoff
Algorithmic complexity generally specified using
This make comment long something take run much memory us increase depends size input
Overhead part calculation since varies one machine another whereas fundamental running time algorithm
This contrasted take account kind resource combination though trivial one complexity overhead
Invoking introduces small overhead
Sometimes compiler minimize overhead
Reliably sending data communication network requires sending payload
It also involves sending various control signalling data required reach destination
This creates additional data contribute intrinsic meaning message
In number dialing overhead
In radio use signalling needed avoid overhead
Protocol overhead expressed percentage protocol divided total number byte message
The information data introduces overhead
The date time expressed consuming
Represented formatted encoded date would consume byte size overhead binary integer representation
As date written follows overhead character adding semantic context CHANGEDATE index
The byte resulting encoded XML correlate size overhead original integer representation

I student Computer Science I hearing word overhead lot come program sort
What mean exactly
It resource required set operation
It might seem unrelated necessary
It like need go somewhere might need car
But would lot overhead get car drive street might want walk
However overhead would worth going across country
In computer science sometimes use car go street better way worth time learn walk
The meaning word differ lot context
In general resource often memory CPU time used contribute directly intended result required technology method used
Examples Wikipedia In computer science generally considered combination excess indirect computation time memory bandwidth resource required attain particular goal
It special case engineering overhead
You tired cant work
You eat food
The energy spent looking food getting actually eating consumes energy overhead
Overhead something wasted order accomplish task
The goal make overhead small
In computer science let say want print number thats task
But storing number setting display print calling routine print accessing number variable overhead
Overhead typically reffers amount extra resource memory processor time etc
different programming algorithm take
For example overhead inserting balanced Binary Tree could much larger insert simple Linked List insert take longer use processing power balance Tree result longer percieved operation time user
For programmer overhead refers system resource consumed code running giving platform given set input data
Usually term used context comparing different implementation possible implementation
For example might say particular approach might incur considerable CPU overhead another might incur memory overhead yet another might weighted network overhead entail external dependency example
Let give specific example Compute average arithmetic mean set number
The obvious approach loop input keeping running total count
When last number encountered signaled end file EOF sentinel value GUI buttom whatever simply divide total number input done
This approach incurs almost overhead term CPU memory resource
It trivial task
Another possible approach slurp input list
iterate list calculate sum divide number valid item list
By comparison approach might incur arbitrary amount memory overhead
In particular bad implementation might perform sum operation using recursion without
Now addition memory overhead list also introducing stack overhead different sort memory often limited resource form memory
Yet another arguably absurd approach would post input SQL table RDBMS
Then simply calling SQL SUM function column table
This shift local memory overhead server incurs network overhead external dependency execution
Note remote server may may particular memory overhead associated task might shove value immediately storage example
Hypothetically might consider implementation sort cluster possibly make averaging trillion value feasible
In case necessary encoding distribution value mapping node result reduction would count overhead
We also talk overhead incurred factor beyond programmer code
For example compilation code bit processor might entail greater overhead one would see old architecture
This might involve larger memory overhead alignment issue CPU overhead CPU forced adjust bit ordering used instruction etc
Note disk space taken code library etc
usually referred overhead rather called footprint
Also base memory program consumes without regard data set processing called footprint well
You could use dictionary
The definition
But save time Overhead work required productive work
For instance algorithm run useful work requires memory work
This memory allocation take time directly related work done therefore overhead
You check
But mainly action resource used
Like familiar value type reference type
Reference type memory overhead require memory value type
A concrete example overhead difference local procedure call remote procedure call
For example classic RPC many remote framework like EJB function method call look coder whether local memory call distributed network call
For example Is normal method remote method
From see ca tell
But imagine difference execution time two call dramatic
So core implementation cost overhead involved quite different
Think overhead time required manage thread coordinate among
It burden thread enough task
In case overhead cost come saved time using threading code take time sequential one

What price paid vast virtual address space provided programmer application
Or word overhead due virtual memory
Is overhead implementing virtual memory beyond memory consumed kernel
One major overhead virtual page used current computation loaded physical memory usually mean also transferring another page back disk
Since costly want avoid often
Hence important concept program though program may use considereable space try organize program much smaller part memory used time smaller part evolves slowly
THis concern code executed also data used
And data often order magnitude larger code
So program handling large amount data often organized improve locality data organisation memory depends also code data
As consequence naive use classical textbook algorithm may result slow program many page fault
I guess tool analyze locality program optimize improve
A specific example design developed various technique improve data locality reorganizing information course design explore memory local way example looking priority page main program already loaded physical memory
Programs bad locality spend much time loading page compared actual computing time

I know transfer rate data size transfer speed according information given I know data size calculate transfer rate
Am I missing something I really given
The information given follows A number file stored hard disk
The platter rotate clockwise
The head move speed centimeter per second
The controller overhead hard disk millisecond per request
The data transfer speed
Assume one request sent every file
The average seeking distance centimeter
Since sector small ignore time rotate head
Calculate average time fetch data scenario

file sector fetched
The sector randomly distributed disk
I know I need transfer rate calculate fetch time I know data size I know calculate
Sectors usually
In case seems actual time take read sector negligible compared seeking verify
could meant following line Since sector small ignore time rotate head
To sure make calculation respect largest sector size check data transfer time negligible
If indeed missing data point

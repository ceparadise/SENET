study computer including design architecture us computation system control
The field includes engineering activity design computer hardware make computer system
It also theoretical mathematical activity design performance study system component mean technique like queueing theory estimation reliability availability system probabilistic technique
Since computer system often large complicated allow designer predict failure success without testing experimentation incorporated development cycle
Computer generally considered separate computer engineering although two overlap extensively area design study computer system
The major subdisciplines computer science traditionally architecture including level hardware design well hardware software component form computer system software program set instruction tell computer carry task subdivided software engineering programming language operating system information system database artificial intelligence computer graphic theory includes computational method one hand data structure
Computer science independent discipline date although electronic object study invented two decade earlier
The root computer science lie primarily related field electrical engineering mathematics
provides basic circuit idea electrical impulse input circuit combined produce arbitrary output
The transistor miniaturization circuit along invention electronic magnetic optical medium storage information resulted advance electrical engineering
source one key concept development idea information represented sequence zero one
In number represented sequence binary digit way number familiar decimal system represented using digit
The relative ease two state high low voltage realized electrical electronic device led naturally bit becoming basic unit data storage transmission
The developed century supplied designing circuit binary input value false true respectively terminology logic yield desired combination output
Theoretical work computability began provided needed extension design whole machine milestone specification theoretical device manipulates string British mathematician model computational power
Another breakthrough concept computer usually credited mathematician
This instruction well data stored fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited calculator approach instruction entered one time
The need user application provided main driving force early day computer science still great extent today
The difficulty writing program led first development allows programmer use instruction ADD symbol variable
Such program translated program known assembler binary encoding used computer
Other piece system software known linking loader combine piece assembled load machine main memory unit ready execution
The concept linking separate piece code important since allowed library program built carry common first step toward increasingly emphasized notion software reuse
Assembly language found sufficiently inconvenient language closer natural language invented easier faster programming along came need compiler program translate language program machine code
As programming language became powerful abstract building efficient compiler create code term execution speed storage became interesting computer science problem
Increasing use computer early provided development consist software automatically handle input output execution job
The historical development operating system summarized topic
Throughout history computer machine utilized two major application computational support scientific engineering discipline data processing business need
The demand better computational technique led resurgence interest numerical method area mathematics traced method devised several century ago physicist hand computation made validate theory
Improved method computation obvious potential revolutionize business conducted pursuit business application new information system developed consisted file record stored
The invention allows rapid access arbitrary record disk led cleverly designed file system also concept development sophisticated database management system commonly use
development optimal algorithm inserting deleting locating data major area theoretical computer science since beginning heavy use structure virtually computer compiler operating system file system
Another goal computer science creation machine capable carrying task typically thought requiring
goal known actually predates first electronic computer although term coined introduced early display data crude image paper plot CRT screen
Expensive hardware limited availability software kept field growing early computer memory required became affordable
A bit map binary representation main memory rectangular array point pixel picture element screen
Because first display used one binary bit per pixel capable displaying one two colour commonly black green black amber
Later computer memory assigned binary bit per pixel obtain colour
together display screen development graphic standard make software le led explosive growth field
Software engineering arose distinct area study late part attempt introduce discipline structure software design development process
For thorough discussion development computing see

In design distinct setting within physical machine produce perceived result different would setting
The interface component probably key standard put user typing different mode pressed return regular mode
An interface us mode known interface
Modeless interface avoid making impossible user commit
A precise definition given book An interface modal respect given gesture current interface user attention interface execute one among several different response gesture depending system current state
Page
In Raskin sense according definition interface modal long user fully aware current state
Raskin refers locus attention word meaning place location
Typically user aware system state state change purposefully initiated user system give strong signal notify user state change place interaction occurs
If user locus attention change different area state interface may represent mode since user longer aware
Several example software described using interface mode Modes often frowned upon interface design likely produce user forgets state interface performs action appropriate different mode get unexpected undesired response
A mode error quite startling disorienting user cope sudden violation
Problems occur change system state happens unnoticed initiated system another person user previously using machine time user forgets state change
Another typical problem sudden change state interrupt user activity
In situation easily happen user operation old state mind brain yet fully processed signal indicating state change
A frustrating type modality created mode user find way word find restore previous system state
According one factor contributing crash Modes intended grab user full attention cause acknowledge content present particular critical confirmation user required
This later use criticised ineffective intended use protection error destructive action due
Actually making action reversible providing undo option recommended instead
Though mode successful particular usage restrict dangerous undesired operation especially mode actively maintained user
Modes sometimes used represent information pertinent task fit well main visual flow
Modes also work convention painting tool
Modal proponent may argue many common activity modal user adapt
An example modal interaction driving motor vehicle
A driver may surprised pressing acceleration pedal accelerate vehicle forward direction likely vehicle placed operating mode like park neutral reverse
Modal interface require training experience avoid mode error like
Interface expert came strongly mode writing Modes significant source error confusion unnecessary restriction complexity interface
Later note accident swearing denoted writes colleague James Winter typewriter used typed number Caps Lock engaged
Raskin dedicated book describe principle modeless interface computer
Those principle implemented system
Some interface designer recently taken step make obvious user friendly darkening background behind window allowing mouse click outside modal window force window close design called thus alleviating risk modal error
state advantage modal dialog improves user awareness
When something need fixing better make sure user know
For goal Lightbox design provides strong visual contrast dialog rest visuals
However method may reduce risk inadvertent wrong interaction solve problem modal window block use application normal feature prevents user taking action fix difficulty even scrolling screen bring view information need correctly choose option modal window present nothing alleviate user frustration blundered dead end escape without le destructive consequence
disliked mode sufficiently get personalized license plate car read NO MODES
He used plate early present various car
Along others also using phrase Do Mode Me In year rally cry eliminate reduce mode
Bruce Wyman designer table art exhibition argues interface several simultaneous user must modeless order avoid bringing single user focus
Alternatives mode command recommended possible
HCI researcher argues best way avoid mode error addition clear indication state helping user construct accurate system allow predict mode accurately
This demonstrated example road intersection
A driver may near home assume similar intersection also four way stop
If happens two way driver could proceed see car
Especially obstructed view car could come though hit first car broadside
An improved design alleviates problem including small diagram showing direction stop sign thus improving driver
Modal control best placed focus task flow
For example modal window placed next trigger activation
Modal control disruptive effort made reduce capacity block user work
After completing task mode activated cancel action returning previous state mode dismissed reduce negative impact
In book Jef Raskin championed termed mode kept place constant action part user mode also called
The term composite Latin prefix mean English word
keyboard example quasimodal interface
The application enters mode long user performing conscious action like pressing key keeping pressed invoking command
If sustaining action stopped without executing command application return neutral status
The purported benefit technique user remember current state application invoking command action always produce perceived result
An interface us quasimodes full mode still modeless according Raskin definition
The feature turn quasimode mode serializing keystroke modifier key normal key pressed simultaneously
In case increased possibility mode error largely compensated improved user physical disability

Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

I studying PIO mode DMA mode accessing IO device based I read PIO mode data transfer go CPU
So I unchecked DMA Windows I guess enable PIO mode And I copied pasted large file see CPU usage CPU usage still law
Should PIO mode exhaust CPU
This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason Your understanding DMA OK
But disk access generally slow
So CPU may spend time waiting disk write byte disk stressed
May try run something like CPU Burner stress CPU measure time copy DMA enabled
Note many thing interfere measurement particularly HD cache

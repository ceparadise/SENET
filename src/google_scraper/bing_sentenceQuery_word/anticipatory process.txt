ACSM Hayashida et consists method discerning aliased state POMDP Partially Observable Markov Decision Process one Markov decision process agent observes local information environment choosing appropriate action based internal memory sensory information agent obtains environment
Though ACSM achieves highest performance existing method based classifier system requires huge number memory internal memory spends long time large scaled problem
This paper improves classifier system ACSM Anticipatory Classifier System Memory focused process learning ACSM aim paper make system efficient
The improved method named ACSMr paper numerical experiment using kind maze problem well used benchmark problem POMDPs executed
ACSMr achieves greater experimental result existing classifier system maze problem

informal description operating principle
It us structural convention normal intended human reading machine reading
Pseudocode typically omits detail essential machine understanding algorithm code
The programming language augmented description detail convenient compact mathematical notation
The purpose using pseudocode easier people understand conventional programming language code efficient description key principle algorithm
It commonly used textbook documenting various algorithm also planning computer program development sketching structure program actual coding take place
No standard pseudocode syntax exists program pseudocode executable program
Pseudocode resembles confused without error
UML chart thought graphical alternative pseudocode spacious paper
Languages bridge gap pseudocode code written programming language
Its main use introduce student high level language use hybrid language
Textbooks related often use pseudocode description algorithm programmer understand even know programming language
In textbook usually accompanying introduction explaining particular convention use
The level detail may case approach formalized language
A need implement specific algorithm especially unfamiliar one often start pseudocode description translate description target programming language modify interact correctly rest program
Programmers may also start project sketching code pseudocode paper writing actual language structuring approach process step followed refinement
As name suggests pseudocode generally actually obey rule particular language systematic standard form although particular writer generally borrow style syntax example control structure conventional programming language
Popular syntax source include
Variable declaration typically omitted
Function call block code code contained within loop often replaced natural language sentence
Depending writer pseudocode may therefore vary widely style imitation real programming language one extreme description approaching formatted prose
This example pseudocode Fortran style pseudo code Pascal style pseudo code C style pseudo code Structured Basic style pseudo code In pseudocode often consists typically theory mixed control structure conventional programming language perhaps also description
This compact often informal notation understood wide range mathematically trained people frequently used way describe mathematical
For example sum operator product operator may represent selection structure one expression Normally used mathematical equation example mean markup language proprietary
Mathematical style pseudocode sometimes referred example origin concept
Here follows longer example Various attempt bring element natural language grammar computer programming produced programming language extent
In language parenthesis special character replaced preposition resulting quite talkative code
These language typically meaning variable declaration omitted
Such language may make easier person without knowledge language understand code perhaps also learn language
However similarity natural language usually cosmetic genuine
The syntax rule may strict formal conventional programming necessarily make development program easier
An alternative using mathematical pseudocode involving set theory notation matrix operation documentation algorithm use formal mathematical programming language mix mathematical notation program control structure
Then code parsed interpreted machine
Several formal include set theory notation using special character
Examples Some language include vectorized expression matrix operation formula mixed conventional control structure

In particular kind entity collection kept order principle operation collection addition entity rear terminal position known removal entity front terminal position known
This make queue
In FIFO data structure first element added queue first one removed
This equivalent requirement new element added element added removed new element removed
Often operation also entered returning value front element without dequeuing
A queue example abstractly sequential collection
Queues provide service various entity data object person event stored held processed later
In context queue performs function
Queues common computer program implemented data structure coupled access routine language class
Common implementation
Theoretically one characteristic queue specific capacity
Regardless many element already contained new element always added
It also empty point removing element impossible new element added
Fixed length array limited capacity true item need copied towards head queue
The simple trick turning array closed circle letting head tail drift around endlessly circle make unnecessary ever move item stored array
If n size array computing index modulo n turn array circle
This still conceptually simplest way construct queue high level language admittedly slow thing little array index must compared zero array size comparable time taken check whether array index bound language certainly method choice quick dirty implementation high level language pointer syntax
The array size must declared ahead time implementation simply double declared array size overflow occurs
Most modern language object implement come library dynamic list
Such may specified fixed capacity limit besides memory constraint
Queue result trying add element onto full queue queue happens trying remove element empty queue
A queue limited fixed number item
There several efficient implementation FIFO queue
An efficient implementation one perform
Queues may implemented separate data type may considered special case deque implemented separately
For example allow pushing popping array end one use function enqueue dequeue list reverse one use although case operation efficient
provides templated class restricted operation
Since Java library contains interface specifies queue operation implementing class include since
PHP class third party library like
A simple queue implemented Queues also implemented
Two version implementation exists
The first one called presented allows queue operation O time requires list
The second one lazy list memoization presented end section
Its time persistency used complexity number element queue
Let u recall list denotes length represents empty list represents list whose head whose tail
The data structure used implement queue consists three front queue rear queue reverse order
The invariant structure rear without first element
The tail queue almost inserting element almost
It said almost result
An auxiliary function must called invariant satisfied
Two case must considered depending whether empty list case
The formal definition followed reversed
Let u call function return followed reversed
Let u furthermore assume since case function called
More precisely define lazy function take input three list return concatenation reversed
Then
The inductive definition rotate
Its running time since lazy evaluation used computation delayed result forced computation
The list data structure two purpose
This list serf counter indeed empty list
This counter allows u ensure rear never longer front list
Furthermore using tail force computation part lazy list operation
Therefore list totally forced
If case internal representation could append append append forcing would constant time operation anymore
Note without lazy part implementation queue would implementation queue time
In case list replaced integer reverse function would called

simple way writing programming code English
Pseudocode actual programming language
It us short phrase write code program actually create specific language
Once know program function use pseudocode create statement achieve required result program
Pseudocode make creating program easier
Programs complex long preparation key
For year flowchart used map program writing one line code language
However difficult modify advancement programming language difficult display part program flowchart
It challenging find mistake without understanding complete flow program
That pseudocode becomes appealing
To use pseudocode write want program say English
Pseudocode allows translate statement language special command standardized
Writing program code enable better organize see may left needed part program
All write word short statement
Let look example
Let review example pseudocode
Compare pseudocode example flowchart add two number Now let look simple example pseudocode
Here pseudocode Now let look example pseudocode Remember writing basic pseudocode like writing actual coding language
It compiled run like regular program
Pseudocode written want
But company use specific pseudocode syntax keep everyone company page
set rule use organize statement programming language
By adhering specific syntax everyone company read understand flow program
This becomes cost effective le time spent finding correcting error
If would like format using pseudocode create program basic guideline Get FREE access day create account
First use command statement
Pseudocode universal
So creating task list would include command specific language like Java C Perl
The point pseudocode design program translated language
Second remember write one task statement per line
Make sure put one task line
Including much information one line confusing increase possibility error
Third make sure capitalize keywords
Capitalizing keywords like help show action occurring specific command process necessary coding specific language
Lastly indent statement loop better see flow program
Indenting become friend
It make thing easier read keep information together especially creating loop
For example If adhere four simple guideline using pseudocode helpful
Although pseudocode standardized use application software create text editor help organize program
If perpetual procrastinator may wait last minute work
So may leave lot time pseudocode flowchart
You find text editor support creation using specific programming language
For instance text editor may support Java may support
In review simple way writing programming code English become alternative flowchart
There standard special command pseudocode
Instead includes essential information creating program reader understands program without getting bogged detail
Pseudocode easy modify written paper using word processing application like Word Notepad
Some key point remember following By using pseudocode save time finding error

consists statement practice claimed scientific factual absence evidence gathered constrained appropriate scientific method
Pseudoscience often characterized contradictory exaggerated reliance rather rigorous attempt refutation lack openness evaluation expert absence systematic practice developing theory
The term often considered suggests something presented science inaccurately even deceptively
Those described practicing advocating pseudoscience often dispute characterization
The science pseudoscience implication
Differentiating science pseudoscience practical implication case
Distinguishing scientific fact theory pseudoscientific belief found belief part science education
The word pseudoscience derived Greek root meaning false English word Latin word scientia meaning knowledge
Although term use since least late century reference alchemy concept pseudoscience distinct real proper science seems become widespread century
Among earliest us article issue That opposite kind innovation pronounces recognized branch science composed merely fact connected together misapprehension disguise principle An earlier use term French physiologist
During century word used pejoratively describe explanation phenomenon claimed scientific fact supported reliable experimental evidence
From though usage word occurred formal technical manner around perceived threat individual institutional security social cultural setting
A number basic principle accepted scientist standard determining whether body knowledge method practice scientific
Experimental result researcher
These principle intended ensure reproduced measurably given condition allowing investigation determine whether related given reliable
Standards require scientific method applied throughout controlled eliminated fair sampling procedure study method
All gathered data including experimental environmental condition expected documented scrutiny made available allowing experiment study conducted confirm falsify result
Statistical quantification also important tool scientific method
During century emphasized criterion distinguish science nonscience
falsifiability refutability inherent possibility proven
That possible conceive observation argument negates
Popper used astrology example pseudoscience Einstein example science
He subdivided nonscience philosophical mathematical mythological religious metaphysical formulation one hand pseudoscientific formulation though provide clear criterion difference
Another example show distinct need claim falsifiable stated publication discus invisible dragon garage
The point made physical test refute claim presence dragon
No matter test think devise reason apply invisible dragon one never prove initial claim wrong
Sagan concludes Now difference invisible incorporeal floating dragon spit heatless fire dragon
He state inability invalidate hypothesis thing proving true explaining even claim true would outside realm
During identified set five norm characterized make real science
If norm violated Merton considered enterprise nonscience
These broadly accepted scientific community
His norm During proposed pseudoscience primarily distinguishable science le progressive alternative theory long period time proponent fail acknowledge address problem theory
During suggested category belief field research field help distinguish pseudoscience science former primarily personal subjective latter involves certain systematic method
Philosophers science argued distinction science nonscience neither possible desirable
Among issue make distinction difficult variable rate evolution among theory method science response new data
suggested pseudoscience scientific meaning mostly used describe emotion If would stand counted side reason ought drop term like vocabulary hollow phrase emotive work u
Likewise state The term become little inflammatory buzzword quickly dismissing one opponent medium When therapeutic entrepreneur make claim behalf intervention waste time trying determine whether intervention qualify pseudoscientific
Rather ask How know intervention work
What evidence
For philosopher may defined one uncertainty input must suppressed lest render output totally indeterminate
The definition book alludes loss craft skill handling quantitative information bad practice achieving precision prediction inference expense ignoring uncertainty input used formulate prediction
This use term common among practitioner
Understood way pseudoscience fought using good practice ass uncertainty quantitative information case mathematical modelling
The history pseudoscience study pseudoscientific theory time
A pseudoscience set idea present science meet criterion properly called
Distinguishing proper science pseudoscience sometimes difficult
One proposal demarcation two falsification criterion attributed notably philosopher
In especially difficult separate two science developed pseudoscience
An example science trace origin pseudoscientific alchemy
The vast diversity pseudoscience complicates history science
Some modern pseudoscience astrology acupuncture originated scientific era
Others developed part ideology Lysenkoism response perceived threat ideology
Examples creation science intelligent design developed response scientific theory
A topic practice body knowledge might reasonably termed pseudoscientific presented consistent norm scientific research demonstrably fails meet norm
Karl Popper stated insufficient distinguish science pseudoscience criterion rigorous adherence empirical method essentially inductive based observation experimentation
He proposed method distinguish genuine empirical nonempirical even pseudoempirical method
The latter case exemplified astrology appeal observation experimentation
While astonishing based observation crucially failed use acceptable scientific standard
Popper proposed falsifiability important criterion distinguishing science pseudoscience
To demonstrate point Popper gave two case human behavior typical explanation theory man push child water intention drowning man sacrifice life attempt save child
From Freud perspective first man would suffered probably originating whereas second attained
From Adler perspective first second man suffered feeling prove drove commit crime second case rescue child
Popper able find counterexample human behavior behavior could explained term Adler Freud theory
Popper argued observation always fitted confirmed theory rather strength actually weakness
In contrast Popper gave example Einstein predicted light must attracted heavy body Sun precisely material body attracted
Following star closer Sun would appear moved small distance away Sun away
This prediction particularly striking Popper involved considerable risk
The brightness Sun prevented effect observed normal circumstance photograph taken eclipse compared photograph taken night
Popper state If observation show predicted effect definitely absent theory simply refuted
Popper summed criterion scientific status theory depending falsifiability refutability
used astrology case study distinguish science pseudoscience proposed principle criterion delineate
First astrology progressed updated added explanatory power since
Second ignored outstanding problem astronomy
Third alternative theory behavior grown progressively encompass explanation phenomenon astrology statically attribute heavenly force
Fourth astrologer remained uninterested furthering theory deal outstanding problem critically evaluating theory relation theory
Thagard intended criterion extended area astrology
He believed would delineate pseudoscientific practice leaving chemistry realm science
like astrology relied uncritically birth date meet criterion pseudoscience time alternative explanation observation
The use criterion consequence theory scientific one time pseudoscientific later time
Science also distinguishable revelation theology spirituality offer insight physical world obtained empirical research testing
The notable dispute concern living organism idea common descent geologic history Earth formation solar system origin universe
Systems belief derive divine inspired knowledge considered pseudoscience claim either scientific overturn science
Moreover specific religious claim although may based untestable belief tested scientific method
Some statement common belief popular science may meet criterion science
Pop science may blur divide science pseudoscience among general public may also involve science fiction
Indeed pop science disseminated also easily emanate person accountable scientific methodology expert peer review
If claim given field tested experimentally standard upheld pseudoscience however odd astonishing counterintuitive
If claim made inconsistent existing experimental result established theory method sound caution used science consists testing hypothesis may turn false
In case work may better described idea yet generally accepted
term sometimes used describe hypothesis yet tested adequately scientific method otherwise consistent existing science inconsistent offer reasonable account inconsistency
It may also describe transition body practical knowledge scientific field
Examples pseudoscience concept include During NSF issued executive summary paper science engineering briefly discussed prevalence pseudoscience modern time
It said belief pseudoscience widespread referencing stated belief commonly believed example paranormal phenomenon listed poll pseudoscientific belief
The item extrasensory perception ESP astrology people
Such belief pseudoscience represent lack knowledge science work
The may attempt communicate information science concern public susceptibility unproven claim
The following indicator possible presence pseudoscience
In book Carl Sagan discus concern Western pseudoscience development certain ancient Chinese practice China
He see pseudoscience occurring part worldwide trend suggests cause danger diagnosis treatment may universal
The stated pseudoscientific belief became widespread peaked decreased slightly since pseudoscientific belief remaining common
According NSF report lack knowledge pseudoscientific issue society pseudoscientific practice commonly followed
Surveys indicate third adult Americans consider astrology scientific
A large percentage United States population lack scientific literacy adequately understanding scientific principle
In writes Pseudoscientific belief surprisingly widespread culture even among public school science teacher newspaper editor closely related scientific illiteracy
However student study journal concluded strong correlation science knowledge belief pseudoscience
In report Singer Benassi wrote pseudoscientific belief origin least four source
Another American study Eve Dunn supported finding Singer Benassi found pseudoscientific belief promoted high school life science biology teacher
The psychology pseudoscience attempt explore analyze pseudoscientific thinking mean thorough clarification making distinction considered scientific pseudoscientific
The human proclivity seeking confirmation rather refutation tendency hold comforting belief tendency overgeneralize proposed reason pseudoscientific thinking
According Beyerstein human prone association based resemblance often prone misattribution thinking
Michael Shermer theory realism driven belief brain essentially belief engine scan data perceived sens look pattern meaning
There also tendency brain create result inference assumption made without logic based instinct usually resulting pattern cognition
These tendency agenticity also driven called bias blind spot tendency recognize power cognitive bias people blind influence belief
Lindeman state social motif comprehend self world sense control outcome belong find world benevolent maintain one often easily fulfilled pseudoscience scientific information
Furthermore pseudoscientific explanation generally analyzed rationally instead experientially
Operating within different set rule compared rational thinking experiential thinking regard explanation valid explanation personally functional satisfying sufficient offering description world may personal provided science reducing amount potential work involved understanding complex event outcome
There trend believe pseudoscience
Some people believe prevalence pseudoscientific belief due widespread
Individuals lacking scientific literacy susceptible wishful thinking since likely turn immediate gratification powered System default operating system requires little effort
This system encourages one accept conclusion believe reject one
Further analysis complex pseudoscientific phenomenon require System follows rule compare object along multiple dimension weighs option
These two system several difference discussed
The scientific secular system morality meaning generally unsatisfying people
Humans nature specie pursuing greater avenue happiness satisfaction frequently willing grasp unrealistic promise better life
Psychology much discus pseudoscience thinking illusory perception causality effectiveness numerous individual need illuminated
Research suggests illusionary thinking happens people exposed certain circumstance reading book advertisement testimony others basis pseudoscience belief
It assumed illusion unusual given right condition illusion able occur systematically even normal emotional situation
One thing pseudoscience believer quibble academic science usually treat fool
Minimizing illusion real world simple
To aim designing educational program effective help people identify reduce illusion
In history science stress social political importance demarcation problem normative methodological problem distinguishing science pseudoscience
His distinctive historical analysis scientific methodology based research programme suggests scientist regard successful theoretical prediction stunning novel fact demarcates good scientific theory degenerate theory spite scientific theory forever confronted ocean counterexample
Lakatos offer novel analysis development Newton celestial dynamic favourite historical example methodology argues light historical turn account answer certain inadequacy Thomas Kuhn
Nonetheless Lakatos recognize force Kuhn historical criticism Popper important theory surrounded anomaly falsificationist view would require rejection theory outright Lakatos sought reconcile Popperian falsificationism seemed refutation history
Many philosopher tried solve problem demarcation following term statement constitutes knowledge sufficiently many people believe sufficiently strongly
But history thought show u many people totally committed absurd belief
If strength belief hallmark knowledge rank tale demon angel devil heaven hell knowledge
Scientists hand sceptical even best theory
Newton powerful theory science yet produced Newton never believed body attract distance
So degree commitment belief make knowledge
Indeed hallmark scientific behaviour certain scepticism even towards one cherished theory
Blind commitment theory intellectual virtue intellectual crime
Thus statement may pseudoscientific even eminently everybody belief may scientifically valuable even unbelievable nobody belief
A theory may even supreme scientific value even one understands let alone belief
The boundary science pseudoscience disputed difficult determine analytically even century study philosopher science despite basic agreement fundament scientific method
The concept pseudoscience rest understanding scientific method misrepresented misapplied respect given theory many philosopher science maintain different kind method held appropriate across different field different era human history
According Lakatos typical descriptive unit great scientific achievement isolated hypothesis powerful machinery help sophisticated mathematical technique digest anomaly even turn positive evidence
To Popper pseudoscience us induction generate theory performs experiment seek verify
To Popper falsifiability determines scientific status theory
Taking historical approach Kuhn observed scientist follow Popper rule might ignore falsifying data unless overwhelming
To Kuhn within paradigm science
Lakatos attempted resolve debate suggesting history show science occurs research programme competing according progressive
The leading idea programme could evolve driven heuristic make prediction supported evidence
Feyerabend claimed Lakatos selective example whole history science show universal rule scientific method imposing one scientific community impedes progress
Laudan maintained demarcation science preferring focus general distinction reliable unreliable knowledge
Feyerabend regard Lakatos view closet anarchism disguised methodological rationalism
It noted Feyerabend claim standard methodological rule never obeyed rather sometimes progress made abandoning
In absence generally accepted rule need alternative method persuasion
According Feyerabend Galileo employed stylistic rhetorical technique convince reader also wrote Italian rather Latin directed argument already temperamentally inclined accept
The demarcation problem science pseudoscience brings debate realm science
Imre Lakatos instance point one point declared pseudoscientific advocate including scientist sent liberal Establishment West denies freedom speech topic regard pseudoscience particularly run social more
It becomes pseudoscientific science separated scientist misrepresent scientific finding promote draw attention publicity politician journalist nation intellectual elite distort fact science political gain powerful individual public conflate causation cofactor clever wordplay
These idea reduce authority value integrity independence science
Distinguishing science pseudoscience practical implication case health care expert testimony environmental policy science education

The section entitled following code mean
assignment operator language use single equal sign equality testing
The well known language Pascal
Due C influence language switched assignment testing
Some older text author trained style use pseudocode
You sometimes see arrow well
From article Some modern language use arrow assignment notably us global assignment whilst using single equal local assignment
From Sebesta Concepts Programming Languages class note King learn assignment standard go back much farther C Pascal
It appears Algol designed decided use assignment
The commitee composed American European representative
Some Germans committee familiar Konrad Zuse Plankalkul language drafted World War II published implemented wanted assignment follow language proposed assignment method assigned
The committee changed ground method entering program time called keypunch use
So compromised equal colon
However Americans familiar FORTRAN lower case wanted assignment operate left since FORTRAN
So managed get changed instead assignment operate toward left rather right style FORTRAN known implemented language rather Plankalkul virtually unknown language outside Germany implemented
Algol strongly influenced major subsequent imperative language including Pascal Thus Pascal kept ALGOL syntax assignment kept lefthandedness assignment
ALGOL designed easy read close mathematical notation
It de facto basically de jure standard writing algorithm journal next year
Therefore instructor computer scientist educated around would familiar style notation
The release allowed character thus prompting inclusion C among others
Just quick pedantic note
quite informal mean want mean
As others said specific language Pascal use assignment avoid confusion equality whereas language use combination purpose
As far actual concerned use equal assigned receives whatever float boat long consistent usage context within pseudocode clear
I guessing assignment I think assignment operator Delphi x assigning value x
But AFAIK thing theory could anything
It usually mean thing mean mathematics assignment

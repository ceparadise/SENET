In computer programming accessor method method fetch private data stored within object
An accessor provides mean obtain state object program part
This preferred method paradigm provides abstraction layer hide implementation detail functionality set
While new dependent code contained within accessor method directly access state data
Also within database fetch dependent code need changed
This advantage type programming
When comparing two data item two access method call necessary order make comparison
Accessors seek underlying data data creation data retrieval initialization retrieval modification

One characteristic programming language concept encapsulation
With encapsulation programmer defines label data member function specifies whether accessible class
When programmer label data member private accessed manipulated member function class
Accessors allow access private data member
An accessor mutator function like set get function
They used instead making class public changing directly within object
To access private object member accessor function must called
Typically member Level function GetLevel return value Level SetLevel assign value
For example While accessor function make data member accessible make editable
Modification protected data member requires mutator function
Because provide direct access protected data mutator accessor function must written used carefully
There error

I argument usage word accessor context Java programming
I tend think accessors implicitly property accessors term implies le provide direct access object internal state
The party insists method touch object state way accessor
I know guy ca win argument I curious know would define term
By accessors I tend think getters setter
By insisting method touch object internal state accessors seems instance method actually us state object would accessor seem right
What kind instance method wo use state object
In word
For example method considered accessor
It method read value instance method called return result adding value another
It seems fairly straight forward instance method getter setter
An accessor method exactly say tin access state type without side effect apart lazy instantiation perhaps something caller would normally know
Methods modify state usefully considered opinion mutators
Besides googling wikipedia show example accessor method So yes I say get value field
The compiler may inline converting simple read anything probably accessor
getRed getGreen getBlue These method usually access value
setRed setGreen setBlue A mutator mutate value I always gone first definition
So generally applies getters setter
If go second method far le useful distinction since cover almost method
Accessor method used access field object
So getters setter accessor method
right term method make general observation object without causing externally observable side effect
A method whose primary purpose cause side effect
Therefore setter mutator method
For good engineering practice public setter avoided make impossible class enforce invariant data violate abstraction barrier class ordinarily enforce
It good able differentiate getters setter technical conversation
method partner method
read state object write state
A method provides access access access internals object method
The author certainly us manner I think term may originate Common Lisp everything
setf used modify value accessor slot

Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary
early adopter computer database technology
In United States National Crime Information Center NCIC established police record subsequently computerized made available police agency throughout country
The NCIC database enables local police department apprehend offender might otherwise evade advent database marketing individual customer characteristic purchase history retained company information system
Even company particularly large retailer catalog house compile comprehensive data individual customer able customize offering communication

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

An assessor evaluates value multiple entire neighborhood home
Their goal determine much property tax owner property pay city county municipality located
His work similar instead calculating value multiple property evaluates value one property time
There appraiser assessor real estate employed
Most work local
They generally work hour regular business day
Although federally mandated educational requirement usually set state assessor board individual locality state assessor assessor bachelor degree
Coursework finance mathematics real estate law useful
Some municipality hire assessor high school diploma
Most assessment office provide training hire assessor get experience source
Assessors working state must certified
To get certified must take basic appraisal course pas examination work certain number hour
To maintain certification take continuing education course
See CareerOneStop information requirement individual state
In addition technical hard skill one acquires formal training succeeding occupation requires certain
Working tight time constraint requires good
One must order keep track aspect assessing property
Good skill help assessor deal unexpected situation
According US Bureau Labor Statistics BLS employment assessor expected grow slowly average occupation

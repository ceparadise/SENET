In wherein stated form
Constraints differ common language specify step sequence step execute rather property solution found
This make constraint programming form
The constraint used constraint programming various kind used
A B true
others
Constraints usually embedded within programming language provided via separate
Constraint programming expressed form embeds constraint
This variant logic programming due Jaffar Lassez extended specific class constraint introduced
The first implementation constraint logic programming
Instead logic programming constraint mixed
Programming language support constraint include functional programming imperative programming
Mostly constraint implemented imperative language via separate library existing imperative language
Constraint programming embedding constraint host language
The first host language used language field initially called
The two paradigm share many important feature like logical variable
Today implementation include one library constraint logic programming
The difference two largely style approach modeling world
Some problem natural thus simpler write logic program natural write constraint program
The constraint programming approach search state world large number constraint satisfied time
A problem typically stated state world containing number unknown variable
The constraint program search value variable
Temporal concurrent constraint programming TCC temporal concurrent constraint programming MJV variant constraint programming deal time
Languages programming follow one two approach typical example refinement model typical example perturbation model
The refinement model general restrict variable single value lead several solution problem
However perturbation model intuitive programmer using mixed imperative constraint language
The constraint used constraint programming typically specific domain
Some popular domain constraint programming Finite domain one successful domain constraint programming
In area like constraint programming often identified constraint programming finite domain
All example commonly solved SMT solver
Finite domain solver useful solving often based one approximation
The syntax expressing constraint finite domain depends host language
The following program solves classical puzzle constraint logic programming The interpreter creates variable letter puzzle
The operator used specify domain variable range set value
The constraint mean two variable take value zero
When interpreter evaluates constraint reduces domain two variable removing value
Then constraint considered reduce domain simply stored
The last constraint specifies digit assigned letter must hold letter replaced corresponding digit
From constraint solver infers
All stored constraint involving variable M awakened case constraint remove value domain remaining variable
Constraint propagation may solve problem reducing domain single value may prove problem solution reducing domain empty set may also terminate without proving satisfiability unsatisfiability
The literal used actually perform search solution
Constraint programming often realized imperative programming via separate library
Some popular library constraint programming

I currently studying algorithm final I came across practice problem I ca seem figure
Here problem Consider following set difference constraint What solution provided shortest path based algorithm set constraint
I know supposed create graph using constraint one edge per constraint one node per variable
So problem would four node
There would also six edge six constraint
The first constraint make edge weight
The second constraint make edge weight
The rest constraint made edge following pattern
So create graph supposed run shortest path algorithm somehow give value variable
This part I unsure
The answer I got I
Unfortunately work first third constraint
Can someone walk get right answer using shortest path based algorithm question
Thanks
I think ask AOE Activity edge network popular tool project management
Each check point arc directed edge weight ij mean activity take ij time start reach
You rewrite constraint form ij
Usually add dummy source arc zero dummy sink arc vertex zero
The graph must dag directed acyclic graph otherwise solution
Then find vertex longest path length source earliest starting time
All earliest starting time form feasible solution value
A critical path longest path source sink path length minimum total time complete project
BTW finding longest path easily done linear time using standard dynamic programming
I think textbook data structure Horowitz Sahni contains topic You seem already know correct procedure calculated shortest path incorrectly
Procedure Source See slide By posting answer agree

I interested understanding DCMST problem explained paper
I think I understand I
Here I understand undirected connected graph V E cost c every edge e j E value want find minimum spanning tree whose diameter
This paper say diameter tree equal number edge longest path pair node
Does mean cost weight edge considered computing diameter word weight add meaning diameter
To compute diameter treat every edge constant
But I would assume weight meaning MST
Also minimizing spanning tree diameter I think
Clearly I misunderstanding something
Could someone explain problem detail
I cracking head problem day
For example find MST k diameter le spanning tree lower diameter k total weight greater MST found prior correct solution would MST minimum diameter constraint satisfied need minimum diameter
correct solution
The graph longest distance pair vertex
This distance measured term edge weight term number edge known
The measure choose depends particular application
In paper mention author focus geodesic distance
When want obtain MST focus edge weight spanning tree number edge
Aiming MST constrained maximum diameter perfectly possible
The author paper setting two conflicting optimization goal rather adding additional constraint
Adding contraint however turn MST problem problem even though computing diameter graph obtaining MST separately problem solved polynomial time
To gain insight notion diameter context MSTs consider following example The spanning tree left whose edge highlighted red minimum
Its total weight sum weight edge diameter vertex farthest edge apart
If add constraint diameter must MST tree right
Its total cost higher tree left spanning tree whose diameter ignoring weight

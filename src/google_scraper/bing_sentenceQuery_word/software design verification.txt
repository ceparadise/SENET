Formal verification helpful proving correctness system internal memory software expressed source code
The verification system done providing abstract system correspondence mathematical model nature system otherwise known construction
Examples mathematical object often used model system formal semantics programming language
One approach formation consists systematically exhaustive exploration mathematical model possible also infinite model infinite set state effectively represented finitely using abstraction taking advantage symmetry
Usually consists exploring state transition model using smart abstraction technique consider whole group state single operation reduce computing time
Implementation technique include symbolic state space enumeration
The property verified often described LTL PSL Assertions SVA CTL
The great advantage model checking often fully automatic primary disadvantage general scale large system symbolic model typically limited hundred bit state explicit state enumeration requires state space explored relatively small
Another approach deductive verification
It consists generating system specification possibly annotation collection mathematical truth imply conformance system specification discharging obligation using either interactive theorem provers automatic theorem provers SMT solver
This approach disadvantage typically requires user understand detail system work correctly convey information verification system either form sequence theorem proved form specification system component
function procedure perhaps subcomponents loop data structure
Formal verification software program involves proving program satisfies formal specification behavior
Subareas formal verification include deductive verification see
A promising verification approach type function include least part function specification code establishes correctness specification
Fully featured dependently typed language support deductive verification special case
Another complementary approach efficient code produced specification series step
An example approach approach seen another form
These technique meaning verified property logically deduced semantics meaning guarantee
A sound technique yield result searched entire space possibility
An example unsound technique one search subset possibility instance integer certain number give result
Techniques also meaning algorithmic implementation guaranteed terminate answer undecidable meaning may never terminate
Because bounded unsound technique often likely decidable sound one

In specifically particular kind based technique development system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Formal method used number level may undertaken program developed informally
This dubbed
This may option many case
may used produce program formal manner
For example proof property program may undertaken
This may appropriate system involving
may used undertake fully formal proof
This expensive practically worthwhile cost mistake extremely high critical part microprocessor design
Further information expanded
As style formal method may roughly classified follows Some practitioner believe formal method community overemphasized full formalization specification design
They contend expressiveness language involved well complexity system modelled make full formalization difficult expensive task
As alternative various formal method emphasize partial specification focused application proposed
Examples lightweight approach formal method include object modelling notation Denney synthesis aspect driven development CSK Tools
Formal method applied various point
Formal method may used give description system developed whatever level detail desired
This formal description used guide development activity see following section additionally used verify requirement system developed completely accurately specified
The need formal specification system noted year
In report presented formal notation describing programming language syntax later named renamed BNF
Backus also wrote formal description meaning syntactically valid ALGOL program completed time inclusion report
Therefore formal treatment semantics legal program included subsequent paper
It never appeared
Once formal specification produced specification may used guide concrete system process realized typically software also potentially hardware
For example Once formal specification developed specification may used basis property specification hopefully inference developed system
Sometimes motivation proving system obvious need correctness system desire understand system better
Consequently proof correctness produced style handwritten typeset using using level informality common proof
A good proof one readable understandable human reader
Critics approach point inherent natural language allows error undetected proof often subtle error present detail typically overlooked proof
Additionally work involved producing good proof requires high level mathematical sophistication expertise
In contrast increasing interest producing proof correctness system automated mean
Automated technique fall three general category Some automated theorem provers require guidance property interesting enough pursue others work without human intervention
Model checker quickly get bogged checking million uninteresting state given sufficiently abstract model
Proponents system argue result greater mathematical certainty proof since tedious detail algorithmically verified
The training required use system also le required produce good mathematical proof hand making technique accessible wider variety practitioner
Critics note system like make pronouncement truth yet give explanation truth
There also problem program aid verification unproven may reason doubt soundness produced result
Some modern model checking tool produce proof log detailing step proof making possible perform given suitable tool independent verification
The main feature abstract interpretation approach provides sound analysis
false negative returned
Moreover efficiently scalable tuning abstract domain representing property analyzed applying widening operator get fast convergence
Formal method applied different area hardware software including router Ethernet switch routing protocol security application
There several example used verify functionality hardware software used DCs
IBM used theorem prover AMD processor development process
Intel us method verify hardware firmware permanent software programmed memory
used formal method develop compiler system went become commercial product
There several project NASA formal method applied Unmanned Aircraft System integration National Airspace System Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution Detection ACCoRD
used develop safety automatism various subway installed throughout world also Common Criteria certification development system model
Formal verification frequently used hardware hardware vendor IBM Intel AMD
There many area hardware Intel used FMs verify working product parameterized verification cache coherent protocol Intel Core processor execution engine validation using theorem proving symbolic evaluation optimization Intel architecture using HOL light theorem prover verification high performance gigabit Ethernet controller support PCI express protocol Intel advance management technology using Cadence
Similarly IBM used formal method verification power gate register functional verification IBM microprocessor
In formal method mathematical approach solving software hardware problem requirement specification design level
Formal method likely applied software system
Software safety assurance standard demand formal method highest level categorization
For sequential software example formal method include specification language used
In allowed mathematical specification testing exhaustive testing expected behaviour individual function
The specialization allowed system formally specified necessarily formally verified
For concurrent software system based see also allow executable software specification used build validate application behavior
Another approach formal method software development write specification form variation FOL directly execute logic though program
The language based DL example
There also work mapping version English another natural language automatically logic executing logic directly
Examples Internet Business Logic seek control vocabulary syntax
A feature system support bidirectional mapping direct execution logic made explain result English business scientific level
There variety formal method notation available

Applying system thinking computing climate sustainability Sometime I drafted frequently asked question list
Here I wrote meaning term validation verification The term Verification Validation commonly used software engineering mean two different type analysis
The usual definition In word validation concerned checking system meet customer actual need verification concerned whether system
Verification help determine whether software high quality ensure system useful
The distinction two term largely role specification
Validation process checking whether specification capture customer need verification process checking software meet specification
Verification includes activity associated producing high quality software testing inspection design analysis specification analysis
It relatively objective process various product document expressed precisely enough subjective judgement needed order verify software
In contrast validation extremely subjective process
It involves making subjective assessment well proposed system address need
Validation includes activity requirement modelling prototyping user evaluation
In traditional phased software lifecycle verification often taken mean checking product phase satisfy requirement previous phase
Validation relegated begining ending project requirement analysis acceptance testing
This view common many software engineering textbook misguided
It assumes customer requirement captured completely start project requirement change software developed
In practice requirement change throughout project partly reaction project development new software make new thing possible
Therefore validation verification needed throughout lifecycle
Finally V V regarded coherent discipline Software V V system engineering discipline evaluates software system context relative system element hardware user software
Software Verification Validation Its Role Computer Assurance Its Relationship Software Project Management Standards Dolores Wallace Roger Fujii NIST Special Publication Having thus carefully distinguished two term advice V V practitioner forget distinction think instead V V toolbox provides wide range tool asking different kind question software
And master use tool figure use
Here one attempt visualize space tool toolbox A range V V technique
Note modeling model checking refer building analyzing abstracted model software behaviour different kind beast scientific model used computational science For climate model definition focus specification make much sense detailed specification climate model built iterative refinement like agile software development
But matter toolbox approach still work mean tool applied little differently
An appropriate toolbox climate modeling look little different picture tool appropriate control system application software etc missing picture particular simulation software
I draw better picture I finished analyzing data field study practice used climate lab
Many different V V tool climate modelling lab room adding tool toolbox sharpening existing tool subject current research
But question best must proceed detailed analysis current practice effective
There seem plenty wandering space claiming model insufficiently verified validated
And people like pontificate climate modeler ought differently
But anyone pontificate way unable give detailed account V V technique climate modeller currently use blowing smoke
If know toolbox already really make constructive comment missing

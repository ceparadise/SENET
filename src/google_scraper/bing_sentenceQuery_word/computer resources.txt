Every device connected computer system resource
Every internal system component resource
Virtual system resource include concretely network connection concretely memory area
Managing resource referred includes preventing releasing resource process finished using dealing multiple process wish access limited resource
Some resource notably memory storage space notion location one distinguish allocation allocation
For example allocating GiB memory single block versus allocating block size MiB
The latter known often severely impact performance free space subcategory general resource storage space
One also distinguish resource resource
Compressible resource generally throughput one CPU network bandwidth throttled benignly user slowed proportionally throttling otherwise proceed normally
Other resource generally storage one memory throttled without either causing failure process allocate enough memory typically run severe performance degradation due working set fit memory requires frequent paging progress slow significantly
The distinction always sharp mentioned paging system allow main memory primary storage compressed paging hard drive secondary storage system allow cache compressible without disastrous performance impact
Electrical power degree compressible without power without sufficient voltage electrical device run stop crash device notably mobile phone allow degraded operation reduced power consumption allow device suspended terminated much lower power consumption

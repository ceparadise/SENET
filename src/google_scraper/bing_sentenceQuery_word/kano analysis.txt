In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

Imagine scene innovation team excited next year product upgrade
The idea flowing people come lot new feature firm product
But project leader doubt
The cost extra feature considerable tough deliver finished product budget time
This tool like Kano Model useful
It simple versatile technique deciding feature product service
In article look origin detail Kano Model explore guide using help develop product service delight customer without bankrupting business
The product development customer satisfaction published Dr Noriaki Kano professor quality management Tokyo University Science
Kano say product service much functionality
It also customer emotion
For example customer buy new car expect stop hit brake many delighted system
The model encourages think product relate customer need moving always better approach le approach
Constantly introducing new feature product expensive may add complexity without boosting customer satisfaction
On hand adding one particularly attractive feature could delight customer increase sale without costing significantly
The model assigns three type attribute property product service
These basic feature customer expect product service
For example book hotel expect hot water bed clean linen absolute minimum

These element absolutely necessary increase customer enjoyment product service
Returning example pleased discover hotel room free superfast broadband HD TV normally expect find standard TV

These surprise element really boost product
They feature customer even know want delighted find
In hotel room might finding complimentary Belgian chocolate evening service left bed
Figure illustrates presence absence three attribute product service affect
Diagram reproduced permission Dr Noriaki Kano
You see product feature meet customer Threshold Attributes satisfaction level low
However even fully deliver wo impress customer much
Most product compete Performance Attributes customer weighs one product another judge satisfaction availability various feature
But may discover Excitement Attribute really appeal give high satisfaction even perfectly implemented
Figure show customer reaction certain feature lack also negative zero effect satisfaction level
In bottom right quadrant see product Threshold Attributes even number may even lead indifferent level customer satisfaction
Customers begin find product attractive offer Performance Attributes along line top right quadrant organization position product market
Excitement Attributes wow factor feature give
These feature represent good need many generate high level customer satisfaction

I first admit I still case tape
For young know tape please ask parent
As customer purchased lot music need simple
I wanted clearer sound something smaller store
The music industry responded introduced cassette
The cassette indeed smaller
It fade back annoying click tape used
I pleased cassette collection
Then suddenly music industry introduced something called CD compact disc
The CD offered better clarity storage capacity ability jump specific song shuffle order play
Best one never rewind
The point simple
As customer need changed
In move CDs I realize need changed music industry research keeping competition advance technology delighted new product offering
Even today CDs dust covered I utilize iPod new advance music technology made address music customer need
How company analyze customer need
How easily determine delight customer basic need
One powerful technique address question developed Professor Noriaki Kano Tokyo Rika University colleague
This Kano theory For customer requirement customer satisfaction proportional extent product service fully functional
The Kano model address three type requirement Expected feature characteristic product service legible form correctly spelled name basic functionality
These need typically If need fulfilled customer extremely dissatisfied
An example unspoken need staying hotel cleanliness
This includes clean bathroom clean linen pleasant fresh aroma air
When person book reservation hotel request clean room
They expect
If basic need met extremely dissatisfied
Standard characteristic increase decrease satisfaction degree ease use speed
These need typically Using hotel example spoken need could Internet access room away elevator room corporate rate etc
Unexpected feature characteristic impress customer earn company extra These need also typically Think Doubletree Hotels
Those stay delighted freshly baked chocolate chip cookie delivered room service
Figure The Kano Model Illustrated The horizontal axis figure indicates fully functional
The vertical axis indicates satisfied customer
The line going origin degree represents situation customer satisfaction directly proportional fully functional
In word represents situation customer satisfied fully functional le satisfied le functional
Kano term requirement requirement
A percent improvement functionality result percent improvement customer satisfaction
For example faster response time system mile per gallon vehicle customer like
Figure The Extended Kano Model Illustrated Figure How Requirements Can Be Identified Here Kano Analysis summary Needs change
For example Doubletree Hotel example freshly baked chocolate chip cookie Many people becoming health conscious
Perhaps confectionary item longer top delighter
Also consider comment need Internet access hotel room satisfier
While wireless Internet access could considered delighter quickly becoming basic need convenience
The important point keep mind delighted customer past expected expected today meet minimum customer expectation future
The author well captured market dynamic Kano model extended model
Very good work I really like Time element paper discus
I suppose could call getting spoiled
This exactly I needed hear
Putting work next task
Developing right analysis format sandwich shop I studying
Thanks
Thanks article
I referred many article per Kano Model meeting requirement understand concept
This article made WOW providing additional unexpected input Figure
Thanks
Two point First It case customer need changing much delighted got asked
Wouldn delighted got two scoop ice cream paid one
Its human nature want even I know I want
Just give tell I delighted disappointed
LOL Second I would submit much consumer product feature delight consumer developed invented scientific research lab initially directed towards military noncommerical application
Only year later made available consumer product application
Yes I would beyond delighted I could teleport vacation destination instead using delightful airline flight
But delightful feature unlikely lifetime even scientist figure guess would get first dibs
My two cent worth

The theory product development developed Professor classifies customer preference five category
These category translated English using various name delighters satisfier dissatisfiers etc
refer original article written Kano
One main point assessment Kano model threshold attribute
These basically feature product must order meet customer demand
If attribute overlooked product simply incomplete
If new product examined using threshold aspect may possible enter market
This first important characteristic Kano model
The product manufactured type consumer base therefore must crucial part product innovation
Threshold attribute simple component product
However available product soon leave market due dissatisfaction
The attribute either
An example threshold attribute would steering wheel car
The car good able steered
The threshold attribute often seen price entry
Many product threshold attribute overlooked
Since component product necessary guideline many consumer judge advanced particular feature
Therefore many time company want improve attribute consumer remain neutral change threshold section
A performance attribute defined skill knowledge ability behavioral characteristic associated
Performance attribute metric company base business aspiration
They explicit purpose
Companies prioritize investment decision effort explain strategy using performance attribute
These strategy sometimes recognized company slogan
For example slogan The Pursuit Perfection Quality Always low price
Always Cost
In retail focus generally assuring availability product best cost
Performance attribute better better performance attribute improve customer satisfaction
Conversely weak performance attribute reduces customer satisfaction
When customer discus need need fall performance attribute category
Then attribute form weighted need product concept evaluated
The price customer willing pay product closely tied performance attribute
So higher performance attribute higher customer willing pay product
Performance attribute also often require analysis cost
As customer start rate attribute important company ask much extra would willing pay attribute
And increase price product attribute deter customer purchasing
Prioritization matrix useful determining attribute would provide greatest return customer satisfaction
Not Kano model feature performance attribute additionally incorporates excitement attribute well
Excitement attribute part unforeseen client may yield paramount satisfaction
Having excitement attribute help scenario okay included
The beauty behind excitement attribute spur potential consumer imagination attribute used help customer discover need never thought
The key behind Kano model engineer discover unknown need enlighten consumer sort engage awe effect
Having concurrent excitement attribute within product provide significant competitive advantage rival
In diverse product assortment excitement attribute act WOW factor trigger impulsive want need mind customer
The customer think amazing new idea want
Out attribute introduced Kano model excitement one powerful potential lead highest gross profit margin
Innovation undisputedly catalyst delivering attribute customer need able distinguish excitement today tomorrow becomes known feature day used throughout whole world
An attribute drift time Exciting performance essential
The drift driven customer expectation level performance competing product
For example mobile phone battery originally large bulky hour charge
Over time come expect hour battery life slim lightweight phone
The battery attribute change keep customer expectation
QFD make use Kano model term structuring matrix
Mixing Kano type QFD matrix lead distortion customer weighting product characteristic
For instance mixing product cost reliability workmanship safety technology used initial usually result completely filled row column high correlation value
Other Comprehensive QFD technique using additional matrix used avoid issue
Kano model provides insight dynamic customer preference understand methodology dynamic
The Kano model offer insight product attribute important customer
The purpose tool support product specification discussion better development team understanding
Kano model focus differentiating product feature opposed focusing initially customer need
Kano also produced methodology mapping consumer response questionnaire onto model

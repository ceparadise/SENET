A
Organization Structure
The Line Structure A line structure exactly sound
The management within company start authoritative figure authority move consecutively line aka chain command
There specific management function line structure function line contributes towards production build upon next function
A pro approach job duty clear independent another employee position communication facilitated easy organizational structure
A con approach employee may performing diverse range duty structure explicitly narrow nature person responsible entire position

The Line Staff Structure A line staff structure offset line structure line function still exist management staff function exist offset line function indirectly contribute supportive need company
A President would part line structure Human Resource Coordinator would staff function per se
A pro approach work load becomes narrow line structure position job position created specialization exist within company
A con approach staff structure often
The success organization depends managment employee also strongly depends internal structure term type organizational structure operates type organizational departmentalization utilizes consumer service job specialization task extent managment forming positive work environment

An group people together work achieve common goal
In order work together efficiently group must find best way organize work need done order meet goal organization
defines task divided grouped coordinated organization
Every organization structure clarifies role organizational member perform everyone understands responsibility group
For example Beaver Scouts youth organization meet outdoor activity hiking camping
When Beaver Scouts Colony go camping lodge leader construct list task must performed trip
Tasks divided among member colony written chore chart every scout know job responsible day
Without formal structure scout would waste lot time trying decide many task would likely go undone
Similar Beaver Scout chore chart company use diagram called display structure organization also show relationship organizational member rank position organization
The formal structure organization provides two important role organizational member
The structure organization clarifies role organizational member member know supposed report
The structure also dictate amount control organizational member regarding job organization
The structure organization consists combination six different element
Each element impact task carried organization
first element affect structure organization task subdivided separate job
Is job completed individual broken separate step completed several individual
The job broken small task specialization required individual worker
High specialization result high efficiency lead boredom worker required perform repetitive task
The next element organizational structure establishes job grouped together
Jobs grouped many way including job function product line territory
Every organization provides line authority reach top organization bottom spell report organization

The structure every organization must also dictate many manager required direct employee
This known determines many individual manager efficiently effectively manage
Companies wider span control require fewer manager efficient company narrow span control span control becomes large employee may receive adequate leadership support manager
Another element organizational structure determines authority lie
If top management make organizational decision input personnel organization considered centralized
The manager involved process greater degree decentralization exists organization
The final element organizational structure determines degree job organization standardized
A highly formalized job clearly defined procedure leaf organizational member little freedom regard perform task
A low degree formalization hand allows employee high degree flexibility get job done
Every organization must determine type structure allow organization work effectively efficiently towards reaching organization goal
From employee viewpoint structure organization determines closely monitored organizational member much freedom making decision regarding perform job
The type structure used organization therefore directly affect employee performance motivation
Organizations structured high level formalization specialization expect employee complete task consistent uniform manner allow little room independent thinking employee
On hand organization structure wide span control low level formalization encourage greater degree diversity behavior employee
Let review
An group people work together achieve common goal
In order efficiently meet goal devise defines task divided grouped coordinated
An used display structure organization show relationship organizational member rank position organization
The structure organization consists combination six different element

Successful project management requires detailed planning organized structure
Before start identify task making project decide carry work
The organizational breakdown structure intermediate step process
It help identify employee responsible project work
When complete entire process regard task responsibility OBS deal organizational side project
Project management us specific tool complete required work schedule necessary functionality
One key project management function assign responsibility task particular employee department team
Typical project management tool accomplish include work breakdown structure organizational breakdown structure responsibility assignment matrix
These tool work together allow ensure project task corresponding organizational unit responsible
Project manager use work breakdown structure identify work project team must accomplish break individual task
The process work backward work required achieve project goal
It separate work individual activity purchasing testing
The WBS process divide activity task purchasing accounting software testing specific equipment
The goal break work task allow project management assign cost duration responsible party
The preparation OBS us process similar WBS organizational structure instead work
Project management break project team organizational unit take specific responsibility
The key organizational unit ready carry task WBS
When WBS includes task purchase accounting software OBS must organizational unit purchasing
Project management ensure OBS organizational unit task WBS OBS assign responsibility
Project management creates responsibility assignment matrix purpose
The RAM table list task WBS organizational unit responsible carrying successfully
When problem section project refer RAM see responsible finding solution

An OBS help keep project staffed time budget
Images An organizational breakdown structure document business use conjunction workflow schedule resource breakdown organize people working particular project
The OBS detail report detail hierarchy reporting structure
Organizational breakdown structure normally communicated visually use graph chart
A project general manager listed underneath PM several division might created product development design material management production
Under division might several name employee listed directly larger division
You think OBS tree branch indicates working relationship lateral communication responsibility
The nearer top OBS person likely person broader responsibility
The OBS work well conjunction workflow schedule
This document detail person listed OBS supposed fulfilment project objective
Ideally people assigned task match interest strength
This foster sense ownership project assumes people take responsibility development completion assignment
In smaller organization project member may called upon fulfil multiple role
In case OBS workflow schedule even important keeping people target helping set goal communicating detail regarding direct obligation project
The resource breakdown another key element contained within OBS
A resource breakdown list monetary fund physical equipment manpower need complete project
A traditional way approach part OBS create another tree various branch indicate resource need funnelled
Another approach poll team member assigned task ask need order successfully complete
If budgeting issue business latter approach might better way go give team member sense control various portion project put management budget resource directly within hand using material
The detailed OBS related workflow schedule resource breakdown project goal objective team member likely
That said often best approach project management keep thing simple possible
Have detail worked ready perusal try communicate overly complex way
Focus meeting individual manageable goal strive effective efficient work output
Constantly reiterating project behind schedule budget motivating employee actually hurt productivity

A also referred Contract Work Breakdown Structure CWBS breakdown project smaller component
A work breakdown structure key project deliverable organizes team manageable section
The PMBOK defines work breakdown structure A hierarchical decomposition total work carried accomplish project objective create required deliverable
A structure element may combination thereof
A WBS also provides necessary framework detailed cost estimating control along providing guidance development control
WBS hierarchical incremental decomposition project phase deliverable work package
It show subdivision effort required achieve objective example
In project contract WBS developed starting end objective successively subdividing manageable component term size duration responsibility system subsystem component subtasks work package include step necessary achieve objective
The work breakdown structure provides common framework natural development overall planning control contract basis dividing work definable increment developed technical schedule cost labor hour reporting established
A work breakdown structure permit summing subordinate cost task material successively higher level parent task material etc
For element work breakdown structure description task performed generated
This technique sometimes called used define organize total
The WBS organized around primary product project planned outcome instead work needed produce product planned action
Since planned outcome desired end project form relatively stable set category cost planned action needed achieve collected
A WBS make easy assign project activity one one terminal element WBS
In addition function cost accounting WBS also help map requirement one level system specification another example requirement cross reference matrix mapping functional requirement high level low level design document
The WBS may displayed horizontally form vertically tree structure like organization chart
The development WBS normally occurs start project precedes detailed project task planning
The concept work breakdown structure developed PERT DoD
PERT introduced Navy support development missile program
While term work breakdown structure used first implementation PERT organize task category
By June DoD aerospace industry published document system described WBS approach
This guide endorsed Secretary Defense adoption service
In DoD issued Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items requiring use work breakdown structure across DoD
The document revised several time recently
The current version document found Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items
It includes WBS definition specific defense materiel commodity system address WBS element common system
Defense Materiel Item category The common element identified Appendix L Integration assembly test checkout Systems engineering Program management System test evaluation Training Data Peculiar support equipment Common support equipment activation Industrial facility Initial spare repair part
The standard also includes additional common element unique Space Systems Launch Vehicle Systems Automated Information Systems
In PMI documented expansion technique across organization
The PMBOK Guide provides overview WBS concept Practice Standard Work Breakdown Structures comparable DoD standard intended general application
An important design principle work breakdown structure called rule
It defined follows In addition rule important overlap scope definition different element work breakdown structure
This ambiguity could result duplicated work miscommunications responsibility authority
Such overlap could also cause confusion regarding project cost accounting
If WBS element name ambiguous WBS dictionary help clarify distinction WBS element
The WBS Dictionary describes component WBS deliverable activity scope sometimes date cost quality
If work breakdown structure designer attempt capture detail WBS designer likely include either many action action
Too many action exceed parent scope fall short parent scope
The best way adhere rule define WBS element term outcome result action
This also ensures WBS overly prescriptive method allowing greater ingenuity creative thinking part project participant
For new product development project common technique ensure WBS use
may use similar technique employ feature breakdown structure
When project provides professional service common technique capture planned deliverable create WBS
Work breakdown structure subdivide work project phase
preliminary design phase critical design phase must ensure phase clearly separated deliverable also used defining entry
approved preliminary critical
One must decide stop dividing work smaller element
This assist determining duration activity necessary produce deliverable defined WBS
There several heuristic rule thumb used determining appropriate duration activity group activity necessary produce specific deliverable defined WBS
A work package activity level task It common work breakdown structure element numbered sequentially reveal hierarchical structure
The purpose numbering provide consistent approach identifying managing WBS across like system regardless vendor service
For example example identifies item Level WBS element since three number separated
A coding scheme also help WBS element recognized written context allows mapping WBS Dictionary
A practical example WBS coding scheme The lowest element terminal element one subdivided
In Work Breakdown Structure element activity also known work package item term linked scheduled
At juncture WBS element organization unit control account work package established performance planned measured recorded controlled
A WBS expressed level interest
Three level minimum recommended additional level item high cost high risk two level detail case system engineering program management standard showing example WBS varying depth software development point going level system level
The higher WBS structure consistent whatever norm template mandate exist within organization domain
For example shipbuilding Navy must respect nautical term hierarchy structure put embedded Naval Architecture matching Navy office procedure built match naval architecture structure significant change WBS element numbering naming hierarchy would unacceptable
The figure left show work breakdown structure construction technique demonstrates rule progressive elaboration technique
At WBS Level show unit work total scope project design build custom bicycle
At WBS Level unit divided seven element
The number unit allocated element work based effort cost estimate task duration
The three largest element WBS Level subdivided Level
The two largest element Level represent total scope project
These larger element could subdivided using technique described
WBS design supported software
allow automatic rolling point value
Estimates effort cost developed discussion among project team member
This collaborative technique build greater insight scope definition underlying assumption consensus regarding level granularity required manage project

In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO
ontology considered upper ontology used linguistic tool learning domain ontology
The ontology example combination upper domain ontology
A survey ontology visualization technique presented Katifori et al
The established ontology visualization technique namely indented tree graph evaluated Fu et al
A visual language ontology represented specified
also called ontology building set task related development ontology particular domain
It subfield study ontology development process ontology life cycle method methodology building ontology tool language support
Ontology engineering aim make explicit knowledge contained software application organizational procedure particular domain
Ontology engineering offer direction overcoming semantic obstacle related definition business term software class
Known challenge ontology engineering include application designed assist creation manipulation
They often express ontology one many
Some provide export ontology language however
Among relevant criterion choosing ontology editor degree editor abstract actual used visual navigation possibility within
Next come facility support etc
Another important feature ability import export foreign language
Ontologies developed specific purpose application
Ontology learning automatic creation ontology including extracting domain term natural language text
As building ontology manually extremely time consuming great motivation automate process
Information extraction text mining explored automatically link ontology document example context BioCreative challenge
An used encode ontology
There number language ontology proprietary The coordinate attempt converge different ontology worldwide
The development ontology Web led emergence service providing list directory ontology search facility
Such directory called ontology library
The following library ontology
The following directory search engine
They include crawler searching Web ontology
In general ontology used beneficially several field

Ontology appear Ling Liu Tamer Eds
ontology semantic data model ontological engineering In context computer information science defines set representational primitive model domain knowledge discourse
The representational primitive typically class set attribute property relationship relation among class member
The definition representational primitive include information meaning constraint logically consistent application
In context database system ontology viewed level abstraction data model analogous hierarchical relational model intended modeling knowledge individual attribute relationship individual
Ontologies typically specified language allow abstraction away data structure implementation strategy practice language ontology closer expressive power logic language used model database
For reason ontology said semantic level whereas database schema model data logical physical level
Due independence lower level data model ontology used integrating heterogeneous database enabling interoperability among disparate system specifying interface independent service
In technology stack Semantic Web standard ontology called explicit layer
There standard language variety commercial open source tool creating working ontology
The term ontology come field philosophy concerned study existence
In philosophy one talk theory nature existence Aristotle ontology offer primitive category substance quality presumed account All That Is
In computer information science ontology technical term denoting artifact purpose enable modeling knowledge domain real imagined
The term adopted early Artificial Intelligence AI researcher recognized applicability work mathematical logic argued AI researcher could create new ontology computational model enable certain kind automated reasoning
In AI community came use term ontology refer theory modeled world Physics component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early effort create interoperability standard identified technology stack called ontology layer standard component knowledge system
A widely cited web page paper associated effort credited deliberate definition ontology technical term computer science
The paper defines ontology explicit specification conceptualization turn object concept entity presumed exist area interest relationship hold among
While term specification conceptualization caused much debate essential point definition ontology One objection definition overly broad allowing range specification simple glossary logical theory couched predicate calculus
But hold true data model complexity example relational database single table column still instance relational data model
Taking pragmatic view one say ontology tool product engineering thereby defined use
From perspective matter use ontology provide representational machinery instantiate domain model knowledge base make query service represent result calling service
For example API search service might offer textual glossary term formulate query would act
On hand Semantic Web standard suggests specific formalism encoding ontology OWL several variant vary expressive power
This reflects intent specification abstract data model domain conceptualization independent particular form
Ontology discussed applied context software database engineering yet theoretical grounding well
specifies vocabulary make assertion may input output knowledge agent software program
As ontology provides language communicating agent
An agent supporting interface required use term ontology knowledge
Nonetheless definition formal constraint ontology put restriction stated language
In essence committing ontology
supporting interface using ontology vocabulary requires statement asserted input output definition constraint ontology
This analogous requirement row database table insert statement SQL must consistent integrity constraint stated declaratively independently internal data format
Similarly ontology must formulated representation language intended semantic level specification independent data modeling strategy implementation
For instance conventional database model may represent identity individual using primary key assigns unique identifier individual
However primary key identifier artifact modeling process denote something domain
Ontologies typically formulated language closer expressive power logical formalism predicate calculus
This allows ontology designer able state semantic constraint without forcing particular encoding strategy
For example typical ontology formalism one would able say individual member class attribute value without referring implementation pattern use primary key identifier
Similarly ontology one might represent constraint hold across relation simple declaration A subclass B might encoded join foreign key relational model
concerned making representational choice capture relevant distinction domain highest level abstraction still clear possible meaning term
As form data modeling knowledge skill required
The heritage computational ontology philosophical ontology rich body theory make ontological distinction systematic coherent manner
For example many insight formal ontology motivated understanding real world applied building computational ontology world data
When ontology encoded standard formalism also possible reuse large previously designed ontology motivated systematic account human knowledge language
In context ontology embody result academic research offer operational method put theory practice database system
Ontologies part standard stack Semantic Web used specify standard conceptual vocabulary exchange data among system provide service answering query publish reusable knowledge base offer service facilitate interoperability across multiple heterogeneous system database
The key role ontology respect database system specify data modeling representation level abstraction specific database design logical physical data exported translated queried unified across independently developed system service
Successful application date include database interoperability cross database search integration web service

The word ontology seems generate lot controversy discussion AI
It long history philosophy refers subject existence
It also often confused epistemology knowledge knowing
In context knowledge sharing I use term ontology mean
That ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology general
And certainly different sense word use philosophy
What important ontology
My colleague I designing ontology purpose enabling knowledge sharing reuse
In context ontology specification used making ontological commitment
The formal definition ontological commitment given
For pragmetic reason choose write ontology set definition formal vocabulary
Although way specify conceptualization nice property knowledge sharing among AI software semantics independent reader context
Practically ontological commitment agreement use vocabulary ask query make assertion way consistent complete respect theory specified ontology
We build agent commit ontology
We design ontology share knowledge among agent
This definition given article Gruber
A translation approach portable ontology

A detailed description given Gruber
Toward principle design ontology used knowledge sharing
Presented Padua workshop Formal Ontology March later published Vol
Issues November pp

With excerpt attached
An explicit specification conceptualization
The term borrowed philosophy Ontology systematic account Existence
For AI system exists represented
When knowledge domain represented declarative formalism set object represented called universe discourse
This set object describable relationship among reflected representational vocabulary program represents knowledge
Thus context AI describe ontology program defining set representational term
In ontology definition associate name entity universe discourse class relation function object text describing name mean formal axiom constrain interpretation use term
Formally ontology statement logical theory
We use common ontology describe set agent communicate domain discourse without necessarily operating globally shared theory
We say agent ontology observable action consistent definition ontology
The idea ontological commitment based perspective Newell
The Knowledge Level level description knowledge agent independent representation used internally agent
Knowledge attributed agent observing action agent know something act information acting rationally achieve goal
The action agent knowledge base server system seen tell ask functional interface Levesque client interacts agent making logical assertion tell posing query ask
Pragmatically common ontology defines vocabulary query assertion exchanged among agent
Ontological commitment agreement use shared vocabulary coherent consistent manner
The agent sharing vocabulary need share knowledge base know thing agent commits ontology required answer query formulated shared vocabulary
In short commitment common ontology guarantee consistency completeness respect query assertion using vocabulary defined ontology
Notes Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited conservative definition definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world Enderton
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term

Computer ontology refers interpretation group idea within specific domain defines interrelationship idea
Ontology used study existence entity within specific domain sometimes used identify domain
In context computer ontology act structural framework
It widely use organize information concept field artificial intelligence system semantics biomedical information architecture
Ontology derived branch philosophy called metaphysics concerned study exists
In computer science ontology render framework defining domain consists set concept characteristic relationship
The meaning certain information generally expressed based conceptual information model used modeling application structuring data
The primary concept used building model include entity activity element purpose
The conceptual model define semantic term mechanism organizing information making set assumption actual application modeled
For example application assumed include interrelated entity conceptual model defines term property relationship
For example Common Algebraic Specification Language de facto standard software specification also considered ontology language
It encodes specification software modularity structuring aim subsuming many existing specification language

In defines input output
A type signature includes number argument type argument order argument contained function
A type signature typically used resolution choosing correct definition function called among many overloaded form
In type signature commonly known
In function example would invoked signature In type signature may optionally declared For example A type signature generally written following format Notice type result regarded everything past first supplied argument
This consequence made possible Haskell support function requires two input one argument supplied function curried produce function argument supplied
Thus calling yield new function called produce
The actual type specification consist actual type general used
So write something like Since Haskell support function passed argument
This written This function take function type signature return data type
In used identify method class level virtual machine code
Example The method represented
The signature method look like And disassembled bytecode take form The method signature method contains three modifier A function signature consists function prototype
It specifies general information function like name scope parameter
Many programming language use order pas along semantic information compiler linkers
In addition mangling excess information function signature stored internally compiler readily available may accessed
Understanding notion function signature important concept computer science study
The practice requires consideration function signature avoid unpredictable result
Computer science theory concept particular make much use concept function signature
In signature roughly equivalent
The term signature may carry meaning computer science
For example In especially commonly identified unique usually includes method name number type order
A method signature smallest method
In method signature method name number type possible last parameter consists array value Manipulation parameter done using routine standard library header
Similar C syntax see method signature name number type parameter last parameter may array value In method signature method name number type order parameter
Return type thrown exception considered part method signature
For example following two method distinct signature The following three method signature considered return value differs
The name parameter part method signature ignored compiler checking method uniqueness
In programming language method signature object declared interface header file
For example defines method return general object take one integer argument
requires type signature explicit type signature equivalent

Mathematics Subject Classification If behaviour computer program described formally necessary
verification program two basic component syntax semantics required
Here discus syntactical component determined
Informally signature give available data format
sort available operation defined
Signatures used inductive definition two important formal language composition signature operation
The first language formal language term consisting operation signature
The second language give set formula based operation provided signature logical operation provided logic consideration
A signature S F consists set S set F
Every function symbol F assigned ar N giving number argument f
In case ar f function symbol F symbol f called symbol
Every function symbol F assigned type ar f
The function type make set F S set
Thus F may contain different function symbol designated way distinguished function type
An example addition symbol used integer real resp
float number
Such function symbol called
If admissable function type limited S constant symbol must considered separately
This lead signature form S C F C set constant symbol C C
If signature part E considered constant avoided alltogether assumption algebra used model D nonempty
In case constant symbol C replaced unary function symbol F law E f value value argument
A signature morphism signature signature pair consisting mapping sort mapping function symbol function type preserved according type f type f ar f function type f ar f
The class signature together signature morphisms form category
We consider signature B B B propositional logic
The set B B sort consists sort B truth value
The set B function symbol element Written pseudocode specification language B form BOOL

Follow u A basically way ensure electronic document spreadsheet text file etc

Authentic mean know created document know altered way since person created
Digital signature rely certain type ensure authentication
Encryption process taking data one computer sending another encoding form computer able decode
Authentication process verifying information coming trusted source
These two process work hand hand digital signature
There several way authenticate person information computer The use user name password provide common form authentication
You enter name password prompted computer
It check pair secure file confirm
If either name password match allowed access
Probably one oldest method ensuring data correct checksum also provide form authentication since invalid checksum suggests data compromised fashion
A checksum determined one two way
Let say checksum packet byte long mean maximum value
If sum byte packet le checksum contains exact value
However sum byte checksum remainder total value divided
Look example CRCs similar concept checksum use polynomial division determine value CRC usually bit length
The good thing CRC accurate
If single bit incorrect CRC value match
Both checksum CRC good preventing random error transmission provide little protection intentional attack data
The encryption technique much secure
key mean computer secret key code use encrypt packet information sent network computer
Private key requires know computer talk install key one
Private key encryption essentially secret code two computer must know order decode information
The code would provide key decoding message
Think like
You create coded message send friend letter substituted letter second
So A becomes C B becomes D
You already told trusted friend code Shift
Your friend get message decodes
Anyone else see message see nonsense
Public key encryption us combination private key public key
The private key known computer public key given computer computer want communicate securely
To decode encrypted message computer must use public key provided originating computer private key
The key based hash value
This value computed base input number using hashing algorithm
The important thing hash value nearly impossible derive original input number without knowing data used create hash value
Here simple example You see hard would determine value came multiplication
But knew multiplier would easy calculate value
Public key encryption much complex example basic idea
Public key generally use complex algorithm large hash value encrypting even number
A number possible different combination
That many combination water molecule million olympic size swimming pool
Even tiniest water droplet image billion billion water molecule
To implement public key encryption large scale secure Web server might need requires different approach
This digital certificate come
A digital certificate essentially bit information say Web server trusted independent source known
The Certificate Authority act middleman computer trust
It confirms computer fact say provides public key computer
The based type public key encryption method us
DSS format digital signature endorsed US government
The DSA algorithm consists private key originator document signer know public key

News view insight ESET security community By posted It generally antimalware software detects computer virus worm trojan horse threat scanning file using signature already
A signature could simple string like using find command word processor locate particular piece text complex tiny macro subroutine tell scanning engine look find
Signature scanning work well detecting threat already identified antimalware program detect new previously unseen threat
One method used
But heuristic work
Randy Abrams ESET Director Technical Education find following definition helpful explaining heuristic The science heuristic study information discovered learned
It explains one look problem find solution opposed
Often heuristic rule thumb one might learned
In computer science heuristic algorithm consistently performs quickly provides good result
But antimalware software heuristic also specialized meaning Heuristics refers set opposed specific set program detect malicious behavior without uniquely identify program responsible classic virus scanner work
identifying specific computer virus program
The heuristic engine used antimalware program might include rule following Some heuristic rule may heavier weight thus score higher others meaning match one particular rule likely indicate presence malicious software multiple match based different rule
Even advanced heuristic might trace instruction program code passing computer processor execution allow program run virtual environment sandbox examine behavior performed change made virtual environment forth
In effect antimalware software contain specialized emulator allow trick program thinking actually running computer instead examined antimalware software potential threat
Keep mind term program used necessarily mean executable program file file
A heuristic engine could examining process structure memory data portion payload packet travelling network forth
Likewise heuristic engine simply scan file like classic antivirus program looking known pattern
It might trace instruction program passing code processor execution allow program run virtual environment sandbox examine behavior performed change made virtual environment forth
The advantage heuristic analysis code detect variant modified form existing malicious program new malicious program well
Combined way looking malware signature detection behavioral monitoring reputation analysis heuristic offer impressive accuracy
That correctly detecting high proportion real malware yet exhibiting low false positive alarm rate well since misdiagnosing innocent file malicious cause severe problem
Understanding heuristic work something specialty antimalware field
If interested would like know field I would suggest white paper written David Harley Andrew Lee
For technical examination technology Peter Szor book though several year old still worth reading
Author ESET Hello
ESET virus researcher said file already detected generic signature detects advanced heuristic
Please explain
Generic signature use variety technology
ESET generic signature complex time involve use advanced heuristic time
This part way improve detection keeping false positive low
Thanks answer
Another question fix false positive
Add checksum ESET whitelist something else
There numerous way false positive alarm fixed heuristic checksum hash various type
The exact method would vary based underlying reason false positive occurred
I fix false positive virus lab job It really depends upon false positive
Sometimes modification signature used fix false positive
Sometimes change heuristic required fix false positive
Whitelisting relatively rarely used fix false positive case warranted
Heuristics also known unproved method seem work practice
In term heuristic silver bullet usually yield false positive false negative
Those metric usually difficult evaluate actually people try evaluate heuristic wrong
We know antivirus software perfect usually updated old fashioned signature detection trustable process year experience
Heuristics younger security professional I would need objective reproducible metric heuristic efficiency
So I able manage risk decide worth take risk rely heuristic I used classic signature critical host
Signature scanning heuristic scanning technology many year Matthieu
Around I McAfee Associates began using called fuzzy logic detect subsequently remove boot sector master boot record infecting virus
If ever came across report Generic Boot Generic MBR virus VIRUSCAN type heuristic underlying technology used although use term
The first time I actually heard heuristic Fridrik Skulason around
I believe Frans Veldman Righard Zwienenberg also independently developed heuristic ESaSS ThunderByte well
Classic signature generate false positive false negative alarm saw several case last year
Heuristics ESET case used conjunction classic signature
Together actually reduce chance false positive false negative alarm
As far testing go retrospective testing software one way testing heuristic done Freeze signature update running program newer malware see detected
Results course decay time repeated testing allow determine well heuristic detection performing
Heuristics usually yield false Signatures usually yield false negative signature specific threat prone miss every threat
AV without heuristic viable today
Generic signature type heuristic approach used virtually every antivirus vendor
It would foolish rely heuristic signature alone rely upon security product alone
Hi thanks feedback
From I post I though called heuristic related program behavior
From point view regular expression merely signature
I agree signature yield false positive false negative
Nevertheless mechanism known controled ie taking instance false alarm straighforward understand cause error
When dealing behavior quite complex
Concerning Heuristics usually yield false positive trust good control better
There hardly reproducible study false positive false negative
For example VB test reproducible since test case remains proprietary
Heuristics unproved method inspired intuition seem work practice
I think foolishness reliying obscure technlogy neither controlable provable
Heuristics hardly obsure
Heuristics used virtually antivirus product today
There way test false positive false negative
False positive easily tested scan signature new program change existing signature heuristic may create false positive point
For testing efficacy retrospective testing
You freeze product period time collect brand new threat known exist time product last updated
At end period time scan without updating
Anything detected heuristic detection exception anything missed false negative
When looking result standard testing combined retrospective testing becomes pretty clear combination technology offer significantly better protection
Muy agradecido por toda la informacion Can Heuristics trigger detection similarity Generic signature wildcard found
Hello Yes could heuristic rule

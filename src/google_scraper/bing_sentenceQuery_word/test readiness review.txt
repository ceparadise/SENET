This step contains diagnostic exam exactly length actual AP Computer Science A Exam
However way closely match expect find real test
Use test familiarize AP Computer Science A Exam ass strength weakness begin review test
Familiarize type question level difficulty actual Computer Science A Exam early test preparation process
Use diagnostic exam identify content area need focus test preparation effort
The purpose diagnostic exam give feel actual AP Computer Science A Exam like identify content area need review
This diagnostic exam length real exam
Since one purpose diagnostic exam give preview expect AP Computer Science A Exam take exam earlier rather later
However attempting diagnostic exam without studied Java yet may feel overwhelmed confused
If starting book September may want read sampling question diagnostic exam save test later know Java
Taking diagnostic exam begin review help identify content already know content need revisit alter test prep plan accordingly
Take diagnostic exam step begin review save practice exam end book covered material ready test ability
When take diagnostic exam try reproduce actual testing environment closely possible
Find quiet place interrupted
Do listen music watch movie taking exam
You able real exam
Set timer stop working minute section
Note far gotten learn pace take extra time complete question find area weakness
Use answer sheet provided fill correct oval pencil
Although computer science exam AP exam test
Part I exam contains question
On actual exam minute complete question
For diagnostic exam give minute complete question
Note penalty guessing exam sure answer eliminate obviously wrong answer choice guess
You find helpful strategy use answering question Step
Part II exam consists question
On AP Computer Science A Exam minute complete four question containing multiple part
On diagnostic exam give minute complete two question
Strategies use approach question efficiently effectively found Step
Read strategy tried diagnostic exam become familiar type question exam
Following exam find answer test question also complete explanation answer
Don read explanation question missed also need understand explanation question got right sure
In fact good idea work explanation question
Working explanation one effective review tool book
If missed lot question diagnostic exam starting learning program Java stress
Step book explains concept appear AP Computer Science A Exam
Read Concepts Step practice question concept read explanation understand correct answer correct
Then well prepared AP Computer Science A Exam
On hand well question diagnostic exam understand explanation question may able skip concept Step
Look summary key idea begin concept Step
If reasonably sure understand concept already may want skip concept review question Rapid Review move next concept
A good test prep plan focus area need review
Now let get started

In Mathematics complex number number composed real component imaginary component
Complex number expressed form real number imaginary number mean
In complex expression considered considered
You add subtract multiply divide complex number
Addition complex number involves adding part part two separate sum expressing answer new complex number
Here example addition complex number
Multiplication complex number involves using distributive property like multiplying polynomial
The first term always real number middle two term combined last term
Remember simplifying multiplying last term real number added first term
Combine like term
Write complex number format
Here additional example multiplication complex number
Write complete ComplexNumber class including An outline class including method declaration follows
The High School Coin Collection Club need new software help organize coin collection
Each coin collection represented object Coin class
The Coin class maintains three piece information coin country origin year minted type coin
Because coin denomination vary country country club decided assign coin type coin lowest denomination next lowest
For American coin coinType assigned like The Coin Club currently keep track coin maintaining ArrayList Coin object country
The coin ArrayList order year oldest newest
If two coin minted year coin appear random order respect coin year
The Coin Club acquired new collection box various size store coin
The box rectangular contain many small compartment grid row column
The club store coin different country different box
The CoinCollectionTools class assist coin club organizing maintaining collection
The CoinCollectionTools class constructor initializes instance variable coinBox array Coin object dimension specified parameter
It instantiates Coin object array default Coin object country equal country name passed parameter year equal coinType equal
Complete CoinCollectionTools class constructor
b The Coin Club intends fill collection box list coin starting upper left corner moving column order Coin object placed compartment
The fillCoinBox method take parameter ArrayList Coin object order year minted return chart showing position box filled order
You may assume coinBox initialized intended regardless wrote part
Complete method fillCoinBox
c Sometimes Coin Club would prefer see list coin organized coin type
The fillCoinTypeList method us value coinBox create return ArrayList Coin object filled first Coin object type type type
You may assume country coin type
Note number coin specific type may
Since original coinBox filled order Coin object retrieved coinBox order
This maintain ordering year within coin type
Remember CoinCollectionTools class constructor filled coinBox default Coin object coinType entry coinBox null
You may assume coinBox initialized filled intended regardless wrote part b
Complete method fillCoinTypeList

Please keep mind multiple way write solution question general refined statement problem pretty much everyone
Look algorithm coded solution determine accomplishes task
assessed per problem using local variable without first declaring returning value void method constructor accessing array ArrayList incorrectly overwriting information passed parameter including unnecessary code cause side effect like compile error console output Write ComplexNumber class represent complex number allow addition multiplication two ComplexNumber object
Write ComplexNumber class includes Instantiates private instance variable initializes passed parameter constructor Implements add method Accesses component parameter ComplexNumber Adds component parameter component object Instantiates return new ComplexNumber object containing correct sum Implements multiply method Multiplies real component real component multiplies imaginary component imaginary component Multiplies real component imaginary component imaginary component real component Adds four result find real imaginary component product Instantiates return new ComplexNumber object containing correct product Correctly implement accessors instance variable Complete CoinCollectionTools class constructor
Instantiate instance variable coinBox new array size specified parameter
Traverse array filling every cell Coin object instantiated country country parameter year coinType
Inner loop traverse column array
declaring different array named coinBox exists within constructor
The instance variable coinBox instantiated
If read whole problem starting code might noticed two part work order
You write order also
Since filling every cell information make difference
Complete fillCoinBox method
The parameter myCoins ArrayList Coin object order year minted
Assign coinBox grid order
You may thought using keep track column row
Here another way
This solution base loop grid rather ArrayList
Complete fillCoinTypeList method
Given coinBox created part filled part b create list contains Coins order coin type
If Coins retrieved coinBox order already order year
There many way write method
Maybe bit different sample solution sure work
Here sample driver program
Running let see code work help debug
Copy CoinCollectionToolsDriver IDE along complete Coin CoinCollectionTools class including solution
You also need add import statement first line CoinCollectionTools class import

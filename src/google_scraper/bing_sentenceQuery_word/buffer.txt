In region physical memory storage used temporarily store moved one place another
Typically data stored buffer retrieved microphone sent output device speaker
However buffer may used moving data within computer
This comparable buffer telecommunication
Buffers implemented fixed memory location using virtual data buffer software pointing location physical memory
In case data stored data buffer stored
A majority buffer implemented typically use faster store temporary data due much faster access time compared
Buffers typically used difference rate data received rate processed case rate variable example printer
A buffer often adjusts timing implementing algorithm memory simultaneously writing data queue one rate reading another rate
Buffers often used conjunction sending receiving data playing sound speaker
A line amusement park share many similarity
People ride coaster come unknown often variable pace roller coaster able load people burst coaster arrives loaded
The act temporary space wishing ride wait ride available
Buffers usually used first first method outputting data order arrived
Buffers increase application performance allowing operation file read writes complete quickly instead blocking waiting hardware interrupt access physical disk subsystem instead operating system immediately return successful result API call allowing application continue processing kernel completes disk operation background
Further benefit achieved application reading writing small block data correspond block size disk subsystem allowing buffer used aggregate many smaller read write operation block size efficient disk subsystem case read sometimes completely avoid physically access disk
A buffer used telecommunication compensates difference rate flow event transferring data one device another
Buffers used many purpose including A often also act buffer vice versa
However cache operate premise data read multiple time written data soon read good chance multiple read writes combine form single larger block
Their sole purpose reduce access underlying slower storage
A cache also usually designed invisible
A Disk Cache File Cache keep statistic data contained within commits data within period mode
A buffer none
A buffer primarily used input output sometimes storage data either en route medium data may modified manner written read sequential manner
An early mention print buffer Outscriber devised image processing pioneer Russel Kirsch One important problem design automatic digital computer getting calculated result machine rapidly enough avoid delaying progress calculation
In many problem computer applied amount output data relatively big big serious inefficiency would result forcing computer wait data typed existing printing device
This difficulty solved SEAC providing magnetic recording device output unit
These device able receive information machine rate time fast electric typewriter operated
Thus better efficiency achieved recording output data transcription made later magnetic recording device printing device without tying main computer

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A buffer data area shared hardware device program process operate different speed different set priority
The buffer allows device process operate without held

This much efficient accessing file disk time make change file
Note change initially buffer disk lost fails editing session
For reason good idea save file periodically
Most word processor automatically save file regular interval

Buffers typically created Random Access Memory RAM rather fetching data RAM faster retrieving platter technology used conventional hard drive
Some hardware device come RAM case printer
Printers designed small workload generally smaller buffer work horse model greater amount RAM
When clicking button print job computer sends data printer RAM freeing system RAM handle task
This allows print job run background referred
A printer buffer print job first served basis capable maintaining cue especially important networked environment
Another example streaming online multimedia content
Without use buffer user would either wait entire file load local machine playing sit playback break jump created millisecond longer delay data stream
Here work Files data music video transported across Internet small discreet data packet
These packet arrive independently recombined reordered recreate original data stream without interruption
If data packet missing video playback jump next packet line
To avoid second worth stream stored buffer playback begin stay ahead display paving way smooth sailing
Some people might deduce good idea configure area memory large ensure smooth playback
The problem bigger buffer le system RAM available task
In case graphic card share memory system RAM creating temporary storage large actually degrade playback might run short memory required display streaming content
This cause playback appear though viewed heat wave become jumpy break intermittently hang
Since optimum buffer size determined mostly connection speed system RAM playback problem often improved fully corrected adjusting area memory either slightly smaller slightly larger
The correction serve best also depends reliability speed source streaming content
A smaller buffer work quite well fast source offering quicker playback additional RAM graphic rendering
A slower source might require slightly larger one else equal
Users might need experiment find right size
Adding RAM system share memory graphic card referred also improve allowing larger buffer without compromising playback quality
Adding system RAM also help graphic card nominal amount RAM
Users usually change buffer size multimedia content software used listening watching streaming material
Typically slider control allows user increase decrease amount memory set aside
Word processor spreadsheet program nearly productivity package use buffer keep track change within document project reversion undo command possible
This memory also responsible saving temporary copy material progress case crash power outage document retrieved even officially saved
KoiwiGal Yeah especially since many place getting super fast internet
The faster internet le buffer need least streaming file
Most standard desktop package provide enough RAM I would make sure getting ripped come laptop particularly smaller one
If going use word processor big deal want decent graphic thing game need make sure spec modern standard
It easy check good level RAM forth looking around online computer forum price comparison site lot article describing exactly look new gadget
Well RAM expensive though depend getting got computer
Sometimes cheaper get better computer rather worrying upgrading
This particularly true since computer geek wo shy customizing computer place sell component really discount much
But package often discounted tempt someone getting
And say article depends want
Unless really creating art gaming need RAM world prepare decent buffer
I always thought important try get RAM especially laptop something ca really modified buy
With desktop computer generally buy RAM install problem even computer technician
When installing part computer actually pretty easy figure
You even need know component work need get component know need plug place go
One editor review suggestion make change warranted

A buffer contains data stored short amount time typically computer memory
The purpose buffer hold data right used
For example download audio video file Internet may load first buffer begin play
While clip play back computer continually downloads rest clip store buffer
Because clip played buffer directly Internet le chance audio video stall skip network congestion
Buffering used improve several area computer performance well
Most use buffer enable efficient access data disk
Video card send image buffer displayed screen known screen buffer
Computer program use buffer store data running
If buffer computer would run lot le efficiently would waiting around lot

Abstract Buffer Overflows one main reason problem computer system
Statistics report shown number attack past year increasing drastically buffer overflow also rated occurring attack
This paper basically provides various prevention technique Buffer Overflow attack like Canaries DEP ASLR deployed working well certain extent
It job compiler check error vulnerability code
In C compiler efficient detect logical error
The simplest form buffer overflow attack would follows char char strcpy The line code compiled without error C compiler syntactical error
But logically copying string char buffer hold char
This might small typing error programmer side result attack overwrite data might stored memory location next space allocated
This Buffer Overflow
Its type explained section
Buffer Overflow Attack defined Kramer occurs program process try force data buffer actually intended hold
The simplest example explain program layman term let u assume jug one capacity litre another litre
If try empty water jug hold litre spill litre water
This attack many consequence system like incorrect result security breach even system crash
Posey explains different type Buffer Overflow attack
There basically two kind buffer overflow attack
attack
attack
In attack attacker flood memory space actually reserved program
This attack exactly easy feel hence number attack respect heap rare
In attack attacker take advantage stack part memory reserved program store data address
The attacker partially crash stack force program execution start return address malicious program address actually written attacker
Statistics National Vulnerability Database show occurrence Buffer overflow attack
It range
The graph declining last year expert say possibility may rise
Some host based mechanism prevent Buffer Overflow Attacks mentioned Detection Elimination Kuperman say detection elimination vulnerable code necessary someone take advantage code
In technique way software search specific type code
This known Source Code Auditing
Vernon WhitePaper mentioned technique way done
Kuperman also mentioned group OpenBSD Group group audit source code free cost BSD based Operating System
The time taken analysis large expertise volunteer determine efficiency
Complier Modifications A technique avoid buffer overflow attack modify way data stored memory
StackGuard type complier used add gap memory gap known Canaries
It work following way whenever function get return call read canary stack check modification
If find canary modified understands attack
Kuperman
Another Complier ProPolice us pointer address memory location
ProPolice also enhancement concept StackGuard
Frantzen Shuey article mentioned StackGhost
StackGhost unique technique developed Sun Microsystems
It detects change return pointer without actually affecting program
It effect throughput also negligible
This made attacker much difficult buffer overflow
Array Bounds Checking Cowan et al explained time operation need performed array boundary checking
If boundary reached wo allow writing array thus avoiding buffer overflow
Similarly write code check size buffer writing
If destination buffer bigger copied ok allow
This technique although might work costly implement delay actual process
Stack Fritsch explains marking stack help stopping Buffer Overflow
But turn also stop genuine program executing directly stack
Sanders also mentioned technique
The article mentioned Microsoft included security feature new service pack Windows XP Win XP
This known DEP Data Execution Prevention
DEP type Hardware Software
In Hardware DEP part memory marked processor
But bit tricky processor supported Hardware DEP
Software DEP hand watch exception thrown program check whether actually belong program
Address Space Layout Randomization Wagle mentioned earlier attacker used insert large number nop instruction work around memory location
ASLR randomly allocates memory location code data thus making difficult attacker find instruction
Proof Carrying Code PCC Necula say PCC technique check property program code also check security policy determines whether allow execute
SmashGuard Kuperman explained technique us modification normal call ret instruction
Whenever call instruction encountered along actual entry return address stack another entry data stack within processor
Then encounter ret instruction match return address
If match go ahead execution else match found terminates program
Also change made data
This technique work well Brute Force Attack
Split Stack Kuperman explained Split Stack Secure Address Return Stack SAS proposed technique prevent buffer overflow attack
In technique two software stack used one control information another data information
Hence even attacker gain access data stack affect control stack
Although might need read write stack worth time
Write Correct Code Cowan et al writes best way avoid kind attack write good correct code
It human tendency write forget code code checked someone else well
The mentioned prevention technique available many technique available prevention Buffer Overflow Attacks various attack
Fritsch another article explained way bypass ASLR protection
He explains exists flaw random number generation ASLR
He explains difficult predict randomization address
Writing program try brute force memory location till find correct one break ASLR protection
Symantec Architect Whitehouse mentioned problem ASLR Windows Vista
Research Bojinov show help implementing ASLR Android phone
He introduced retouching similar design prelinking
Also crash stack analysis introduced us crash report local device prevent attack

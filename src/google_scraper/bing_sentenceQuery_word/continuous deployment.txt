Continuous deployment require lot effort beyond needed continuous integration
Since every change corresponds release le far le time resource available manual testing
They need almost entirely replaced automated test case difficult well require extensive development automated tool
CI encourages
But CD becomes absolutely essential mistake much damaging
Since deployment far frequent much le allowable downtime disruption deployment
It requires better automated architecture management deployment strategy
Continuous deployment popular clearly great benefit offset cost
Specifically I curious benefit unique continuous would obtained continuous integration alone
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
common web service
Amazon Facebook Github Google deploying time
Some operator deploy handful even dozen update day service
I even sure could easily count number deployment event massive shop like Amazon Google per day aggregate across entire estate
Why way
Users fix update improvement new feature hand early often
The patch upgrade cycle integrated everyday use spaced major release
Internal manager product owner individual line business marketing campaign etc
see project decoupled project organization therefore ready presented customer immediately ready dependent numerous variable release train
There le dump lot new feature fix etc
one shot phenomenon
Both user support team learn hate release day periodic bug new breakage unknown new etc
manifest
Continuous deployment spread release moment many small chunk
That may drawback pain evenly spread
For agility
Agile technique kind require feedback loop user
If main stakeholder ask What think idea
How would Amazon
Hold world largest focus group
No publish go
They get feedback based thing go based detailed analytics rather direct customer feedback
organization seem especially likely become eager active publisher feedback loop
For multivariate equivalent
It hard manage complex business thousand million product product option product possibility
They need data driven
While related previous point feedback loop continuous delivery make room necessary continuously testing multiple option laboratory customer behavior
Without ability constantly deliver measure change would much le opportunity test different hypothesis option thus much le opportunity gather valuable business analytics
Fighting nightmare version drift
Those running service apps get pretty good managing version drift situation may multiple logical version app simultaneously use
But even good running dozen two different version want different version configuration extant
The hassle support cost become great
Constantly deploying new code retiring old version keep number version
Build best practice organizational fitness
Just like introduce automated testing technique simple change
You dab
You commit idea testing testing everything
You get good disciplined make sure right tool environment culture become efficient effective operation
Web property virtue massive customer base constant need new content new service deployed huge number update get really good always updating thing
That lead shop like Netflix make continuous cycle part people process technical feature development operation culture
While continuous deployment popular apps nothing ever perfectly continuous
There always internal service capacity move organizational readiness infrastructure change delay prerequisite various release
Even service many update continuously delivered technical marketing training support purpose big change still convenient present promote train deploy bundle
Some change change nature interface app
It wise look work one way one minute work look different next page reload AJAX call
Some feature element make sense context feature available
Finally many big change require different backend service assembled different data schema
These situation always deploying continuously make sense
Limiting number major version play help user consume operator effectively deliver service
So even aggressive case continuous occasional bump

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What continuous mean continuous deployment continuous delivery continuous integration
What opposed
Does continuous make deployment delivery integration thing without continuous
Traditionally Continuous Integration Continuous Build Continuous Deployment Continuous Testing system split module module developed independent team interact much
The term integration refers event independently developed module assembled together complete system
That also term integration testing come
This usually

entire system developed sometimes complete isolation without
Then end module put together integrated built tested deployed
This mean basically first time entire system running directly delivery date
Except course time run
And go hunt problem complex system complex interaction complex module
And integration painful event seen something painful expensive
The idea Continuous Integration turn head instead pushing integration end making painful event every time change module
That way get better instead per year several time day thus much practice becomes much simpler integrate every change spot integration problem early know problem
So idea Continuous XYZ come instead pushing XYZ end late actually change anything early often possible
In order facilitate continuity usually process automated large degree gave rise idea Continuous Build Servers Continuous Integration Servers etc
Note idea Pair Programming could see Continuous Code Review making frequent small commits etc
CI frequently integrating change main codebase
In order CI probably want CI server running automated test codebase commit verifying successful integration
Developers pushing codebase keep commits small change frequently
deploy software production given time manual effort maybe pressing button
Typically achieved mean deployment pipeline test automation
deliver software given time
If set feature ready release business decide feature release time individual basis
It necessitates decoupling
The distinction deployment delivery lie within whether code active production
mean code made production server
It may may active
For instance may feature toggle control delivery software already deployed
If know feature toggle may think runtime
mean code made production also active thus providing business value
In context continuous opposed discrete
Where continuous would describe uninterrupted flow event
water streaming tap discrete would describe isolated sequence event
drop water dripping tap
In term software development As opposed fixed interval possibly necessitated technical limitation regulation simply lack knowledge able thing continuously best suit purpose business need
Continuous Integration software development practice member team integrate work frequently usually person integrates least daily leading multiple integration per day The mean process able perform integration new code build deployment sistematically frequently usually
Unlike guy said I would say thing making overall process smooth
When person department work component without excessive meeting distracting others whole development becomes faster
The release frequency derivative effect goal
And three term pretty much thing need ask hey dude state master branch
broken
I merge
instead care state work buddy finish component make CI system know example creating merge request
The automation take care rest like starting automated testing component others
Is branch merging automated decides merge return ticket back improvement another question
When step compiling software product CI pipeline called
When product website sort running application CD called
By posting answer agree

Agility essential component keeping speed technology change
However come caveat
You IT process agile term development methodology deployment change request complicated unnecessarily lengthy attempt agility might causing frustration innovation
This I believe DevOps come play particular I see ultimate goal DevOps
People traditional view production may also misunderstanding continuous deployment mean le testing
But I would disagree
It actually automated testing regression testing streamlined testing result efficient process byproduct happier employee
In traditional deployment may three four level developer must go order change request get approved update get moved staging area finally change window arrives update deployed production
As customer waiting fix new feature long delay frustrating developer dealing unhappy customer process unsatisfying time consuming
Compare continuous deployment much condensed procedure leverage automation programmer empowered make change test deploy infused agile process
The obvious immediate benefit time customer satisfaction
But benefit well
For instance continuous deployment lower overall risk
We human continuous deployment model make mistake solution around corner
That case traditional model change request take week month resolve go complex chain approval
A perk continuous deployment I believe instill pride empowerment career programmer
The work operation enriched far proactive providing better experience customer
The development team elevated quality experienced production environment
By creating accountability reducing amount resource required achieve value everyone involved higher stake outcome
And better employee experience also make happier fulfilled job
Let look hypothetical example traditional deployment comparison
When change request must go several layer iteration approval creates backlog last release currently deployed production
This demoralizing design development side see customer keep problem already solved fix deployed
To make matter worse often lack communication level time change get addressed done improperly thereby introducing pain risk whole effort
By leveraging DevOps continuous deployment ease frustration production process IT create culture innovation collaboration everyone feel empowered embrace change

People tend use term continuous delivery continuous deployment interchangeably thing long shot
In case people talking continuous delivery
They rarely ever want continuous deployment although least one circumstance might use
That I want talk
But let get definition way first
Continuous delivery set principle practice reduce cost time risk delivering incremental change user
Continuous delivery reduces waste make release boring say vice president Chef author chief scientist ThoughtWorks offer definition continuous delivery Continuous Delivery software development discipline build software way software released production time You achieve continuous delivery continuously integrating software done development team building executables running automated test executables detect problem Y ou push executables increasingly environment ensure software work production
You stop
Until business request change
The value continuous delivery lie fact code ready deploy time QA automatically test every build environment pass code ready deploy
Implementing continuous delivery effectively make team efficient
In contrast continuous deployment mean every change go pipeline test pas automatically go production
With approach multiple production deployment single day depending fast team committing change
Remember continuous delivery mean deploy frequently pace change set business demand
I recommend reading Fowler entire blog post subject go depth DevOps culture In world continuous deployment release approval change approval board code move automatically developer production
But enterprise world case continuous deployment
For long time I believed answer
I believe least one hot fix
Consider team continuous delivery pipeline us automated continuous testing rigorously ass change
After change ready release wait business ready implement pull deploying
But incident occurs team quickly isolates fix us continuous deployment path
This reserved change urgently needed rapidly restore service correct serious problem production
Still fully tested continuous delivery approach would ensure fastest way fix production problem
From audit compliance perspective certainly might concern surrounding segregation duty record keeping
But process well documented clearly defined controlled audited many concern addressed
Continuous deployment serve second path production final step process fully automated install change correct production problem quickly possible
All routine change still go continuous delivery flow queuing pending decision release
But emergency team fully automated path production
They skipping step ensuring fix quickly tested implemented
This keep environment sync highest possible quality
There may example enterprise want adopt continuous deployment well continuous delivery

Dec unique visitor Software Development Conference A note reader As per request developed set feature allow reduce noise losing sight anything important
choosing topic interested
Related Vendor Content Related Sponsor Fastly edge cloud platform power secure fast reliable online experience world popular digital business
Facebook seen number developer increase factor period code base size increased factor
However instead slowing developer productivity remained constant measured line per developer
Facebook attribute much success practice
Continuous deployment involves automatically testing incremental software change frequently deploying production environment
With developer change reach customer day even hour
Such ultrafast change fundamentally shifted much software engineering landscape impact organization culture skill practice
To study fundamental shift researcher facilitated Continuous Deployment Summit Facebook campus July
The summit aimed share best practice challenge transitioning continuous deployment
It attended one representative Cisco Facebook Google IBM LexisNexis Microsoft Mozilla Netflix Red Hat SAS
These company represent spectrum pioneer mature implementation company architectural baggage necessitating multiyear transition continuous deployment
Deployments product range time daily twice yearly
However company strive leverage faster deployment deliver product customer ever faster
To use advanced analytics translate deluge available telemetry data improved product
Here discus summit focusing top adage emerged
These adage represent working set approach belief guide current practice establish tangible target empirical validation research community
Before summit team nine company completed practice
The respondent indicated often company used common practice
Table defines practice term
Although respondent could indicate partial use practice none
They either used practice time use sure
Figure summarizes company practice
The frequent practice automated unit testing staging branching
The company also often used code review manual signoff otherwise highly automated deployment process
We observed resurgence code review often handled lightweight distributed tool engineer motivated others view code rapidly deployed defect become public
In addition company used change ownership engineer call deal implication defect rather company separate field support group bear brunt defect
So engineer motivated deploy software
The respondent also reported benefit realized practice
The prevalent benefit improved speed feature delivery quality customer satisfaction
Also employee happier quicker customer feedback reduced stress
Although making defect public rapid deployment might increase stress tradeoff stress missing release deadline diminishes next release train soon leaf station
In contrast keeping strict infrequent deployment deadline harm quality
With continuous deployment management felt decision rapid feedback
Teams also believed achieved higher productivity better overall collaboration
In addition respondent reported continuous deployment challenge
Architecture safety consistency suffer development emphasizes delivery speed
With frequent deployment ability test multiple software configuration often limited leaving common feature accessibility untested
Teams might resist change development process especially traditional role must blended one team
Products monolithic architecture technical debt automated test might slower increase deployment frequency potentially taking year reach continuous deployment
Finally product requiring high level safety regulation might able fully adopt continuous deployment
Although none following adage applied company participant agreed concept
Jez Humble argues key running lean enterprise take experimental approach product development
In view feature likely persist long without data justifying existence
Previously feature choice carefully considered traded
Those chosen designed built delivered
Evidence rarely supported decision
With continuous deployment developer treat every planned feature experiment allowing deployed feature die
For example enough people hover new element new experiment might move element new location screen
If experiment show lack interest new feature deleted
Summit participant reported using several supporting practice
Generally company collect statistic every aspect software
They record performance stability metric time database column access exception error code response time API method call rate
For company collect information software architecture must designed
Instead keeping localized copy performance error log server company stream metric centralized data store
Finally support data analytics several company employ large staff data scientist reaching much third engineering staff
These company create use rich set data exploration tool including custom data query language
However several challenge exist
For example company quickly outgrew infrastructure storing data
Netflix initially collected million metric related streaming service soon ballooned billion metric
Not could data store longer keep company also carefully consider data essential experimentation
Additionally engineering query extract relevant information feature complex
One participant remarked You need PhD write data analysis query
Significant investment telemetry analytics needed
Investing effort separately costly
The participant discussed situation collected enormous amount data redo experiment one essential data point missing
Nevertheless every feature warrant full experimentation especially feature related storage
Additionally developer must carefully consider privacy implication data collection
As company move forward face challenge establish culture feature experimentation
How enable team consistently collect targeted information throughout feature life cycle without introducing much overhead process
The cost change code production surprisingly cheap
This contrast starkly prediction fix deployed software would become exponentially expensive
In Barry Boehm showed cost change increase tenfold development phase
For example fixing change coding cost fixing testing cost fixing production cost
With continuous deployment time development defect discovery production typically short order hour day
For example developer push new feature production two day work
The next day user report defect
The fix efficient developer finished remember
With continuous deployment development phase happen day person person exponential cost increase happen
So curve flattens
Thus change cost fix development also cost production
Google found scope change review troubleshooting small make culprit easier quicker
Also change deployed production environment development team becomes aware release process challenge quickly feedback
At Facebook developer must confirm chat system standby change wo go live one two daily production rollouts
So developer outgoing change react bug found minute going live
Hardly summit participant discussed cost change indicating effect minimal compared cost concern
With traditional release deployment model code undergoes round quality assurance flush defect
If release cycle three six month newly found defect might addressed user another three six month
Even shorter maintenance cycle still order magnitude longer daily deployment
Continuous deployment let developer speedily deploy new feature defect fix
Continuous deployment guarantee defect found immediately
If found later cost change
However defect found long time likely feature
Deploying code production necessarily mean feature available customer right away
Sometimes new feature might deployed evaluated production several month publicly released
For example Instagram Facebook company engineer might want build new feature threading message picture comment
By deploying code production engineer evaluate test feature live environment running code keeping result invisible user enabling new feature user interface
This let engineer slowly deploy stabilize small chunk directly production without impacting user experience
After stabilization engineer turn feature release
Summit participant described several technique reason slowing release
Instagram often us dark launch deploy stabilize feature six month officially releasing
Microsoft often deploys large architectural change using combination dark launch
With feature flag feature deployed disabled ready release developer turn feature configuration server
This practice let Microsoft avoid dealing integration issue maintaining feature branch
Deploying change early often frequently production reduces overall deployment friction
However approach pose many challenge
Dynamic configuration let developer quickly react problem disabling feature developer easily cause outage inadvertently entering invalid configuration state
Many summit participant reported although code change went rigorous testing analysis sufficient tooling necessarily available test evaluate configuration change rigor
Cleaning removing unneeded feature flag highly variable practice often contributed technical debt
For summit company creating duplicate production environment expensive complicated
They forced testing production even strictly desired
Many technique control speed customer see new change
A company release software slowly still deploying every day
Companies must spend extra engineering effort ensure strategy testing production negatively affect user experience
Survival today market mean investing tooling automation
Practices seen best practice measure maturity backbone process relies rapid deployment
Automated system testing used way run large test suite verify enterprise application regressed release
Now test necessary developer get quick feedback release automated accept fail patch
This tooling let small team manage large infrastructure
Companies top spectrum Instagram Netflix say tooling pay massive dividend
Facebook found small team focused tooling release automation empower much larger team developer
Instagram us automation enforce process
Tooling investment allows capturing common workflow task repeatable runnable operation developer automated system perform
Capturing process tool allows process tested versioned vetted like production code
Instagram faced challenge partial automation process risk developer unaware implicit step needed deployment
For example developer might forget manually obtain operation lock service another tool running deployment command
Practitioners seeing stay competitive survive best practice automated unit testing must
Providing superior product coupled speed enhancement deployed
This change requires company invest strategically automation scope scale change time
Developers power freedom deploy change behest
With great power come great responsibility
If code break production whose responsibility developer operation team
Traditional software method encourage responsibility silo
Developers throw code wall quality assurance QA team throw another wall operation team
Several summit participant discussed developer code stop understand requirement user story production environment
By owning feature code change cradle grave inception deployment burden developer
This burden mean thing break developer one get support call must fix issue matter time day
Because developer change cradle grave traditional team structure must change
Netflix dedicated operation team
Although functional role still exist QA operation embedded development team creating hundred loosely coupled highly aligned team
Instead dedicated function example QA operation development team representative cross section necessary role
Instagram found value team member focus area part team ultimately responsible life feature
Both Instagram Red Hat employed support rotation team member spends time handling customer support result shared pain
Giving team autonomy come example autonomous team integrate reliably
Netflix achieves integration microservices architecture requires team build APIs maintain ensure stable change change
Google enforces team service communication common API type defined data type service must use
With defined communication standard team free build need accomplish task whatever way efficient
From organizational standpoint team migrate new view world
LexisNexis seen traditional organization structure different team report different part organization different goal make integrating team much harder
Furthermore area requiring change make tackling team ownership aspect manual test resource constraint difficult
The developer role becoming le horizontal vertical increasing responsibility also empowering developer understand change impact
practitioner finding scale treating configuration like code lead significant number production issue
Traditionally configuration considered runtime matter managed operation team system administrator
Changes made server live often fashion lead server drift
For example engineer experimenting optimizing query speed database change configuration one database box
This change must replicated four database server
When multiple server intended represent application even one undergo configuration drift lead unknown breakage
Modern configuration management tool Ansible Puppet Chef Salt allow configuration management scripted orchestrated across server asset
The new normal organization treat managing configuration managing feature code
For example Netflix every commit build process creates Debian package completely specifying needed dependency installs new Amazon Web Services virtualmachine image
The summit participant Facebook Netflix noted despite tooling configuration change still cause error
Netflix change daily system tracking reviewing
This lead Netflix participant put company often shooting foot
Red Hat team found large code base large configuration suite become unruly
The lesson company bottom spectrum consider configuration management right start new project transitioning project architectural baggage model
In word configuration management core competency treated like code
Treating configuration like code implies using best practice related coupling cohesion continuous integration scale
As company transition continuous deployment experimenting way comfort customer regarding new pace delivery
In today consumer world product device receive constant stream update customer often choice accept
New generation customer might fact expect
If mobile device training u accept constant change even car television automatically updating business software
The number customer willing wait year two update rapidly dwindle
Still customer company ready change
One prominent example challenge involves Microsoft experience Windows
Microsoft shifted large infrequent update OS regular incremental improvement
The effort migrate user Windows also notably example prefetching installation file frequently prompting user upgrade restricting ability opt update
These change might appeal savvier customer burden enterprise customer might unwilling unable accept frequent change owing customer internal integration testing regulatory concern
IBM Mozilla include important stakeholder unit integration test development
This reduces risk failed deployment stakeholder premise help feel comfortable accepting new release
Cisco exploring using rapid deployment model coinvention customer
Often biggest source customer discomfort disrupted productivity customer upgrade version
For example IBM used take month migrate system new version customer site
The primary challenge coordinating code database change instance
Eventually IBM shortened process one hour
Similarly SAS biggest deployment barrier deployment imposed long period downtime customer support many version datasets deployed system
When moving speedily company must consider whether moving faster user desire
Still best comfort company provide ability deliver change moment notice whenever customer ready
Continuous deployment requires continuous reflection delivery process
Almost every summit participant story bringing entire operation accidental mistake configuration change
For example malformed JSON JavaScript Object Notation setting brought entire discovery component Netflix architecture
To support reflection production failure company employ
In retrospective team member discus cause consequence unexpected operation outage deployment failure
They also discus potential process change
Several participant described experience retrospective
At Netflix developer report outage issue issue tracker rate severity
By tracking outage developer perform uncover trend systematic issue deployment process
More severe outage discussed weekly retrospective attended multiple stakeholder across team
Some participant mentioned despite retrospective usefulness dreadful
Developers find hard hear coding mistake impact user trouble factoring emotion
Mentioning victory help maintain team morale ease raw emotion
In certain circumstance make sense leave responsible party outside room possible
Still despite potential unease postmortem several company observed considerable drop error starting
Retrospectives also shift cultural view
At Facebook inception company instilled developer culture Move fast break thing
However certain point message taken far new moderating creed emerged Slow fix
Some company reflected benefit particular practice sought data verifying benefit
For example extensively studying code review Microsoft far found significant defect reduction
Instead primary benefit involve knowledge sharing improved onboarding process new employee learn necessary skill behavior
As company continue adopt continuous deployment need exists calibrate practice exercised culture defined also constantly question benefit effectiveness practice culture first place
An important aspect retrospective maintain blameless culture difficult developer also expected fully responsible deployed change cradle grave
Most summit participant indicated privacy software security responsibility specific group responsibility developer involved implementing deployable software
Continuous deployment might increase risk privacy security expert ca review every rapidly deployed change sprint often plan security concern
As mentioned waterfall spiral development developer throw code wall tester deal defect
With agile methodology tester invited table participate partner beginning iteration
Together developer tester throw tested product wall operation team deploy product
With continuous deployment operation team also invited table participating throughout iteration dealing operation implication feature development
However people security privacy silo often invited table
Since researcher discussing establish collaboration security team development IT team
This collaboration usually called
We propose going explicitly inviting privacy security PrivSec folk involved throughout development DevPrivSecOps
The aim increase security knowledge developer tester operation staff increase partnership privacy security expert
Companies separate process oversight change higher security risk privacy implication
At Facebook code change considered privacy implication might go push process longer daily one
Additionally small team creates access layer data control force adherence privacy regulatory concern
Google instituted control secure deployment authorizing user check code deployment strict access control checksumming binary
Google also strict division production network company network
The production network consists server workstation reduces possibility tampering deployed code
Your competitor continuously add value product
Do
All summit participant indicated urgency rapidly delivering new functionality remain competitive
A global survey CA Technologies indicated IT executive percent adopted DevOps planned adopt next five year
DevOps continuous deployment similar practice people informally equate two approach
According Puppet Labs survey involving respondent IT organization adopted DevOps experienced time fewer failure deployed time frequently organization adopted Dev Ops
The respondent indicated widespread adoption DevOps worldwide organization size
The top five domain using DevOps technology web software banking finance education telecommunication
The prevalence growth DevOps possible performance indicator support business benefit customer collaboration across department improved software quality performance faster maintenance
Software engineering educator must also take notice
In word Brian Stevens former executive vice president chief technology officer Red Hat The legacy model software engineering going survive transition
Software engineering education often lag behind new reality continuous deployment focus legacy model
Core undergraduate software engineering course must also teach fundamental skill Additionally educator must make undergraduate aware reality deploying live environment related concern data migration deployment strategy deployment pipeline telemetry coding pattern
Ready come continuous deployment
Will ready deliver

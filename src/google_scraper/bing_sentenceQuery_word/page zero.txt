way initial element assigned rather index typical everyday circumstance
Under numbering initial element sometimes termed element rather element corresponding number
In case object value originally belong given sequence could naturally placed initial element may termed zeroth element
There wide agreement regarding correctness using zero ordinal regarding use term creates ambiguity subsequent element sequence lacking context
Numbering sequence starting quite common mathematics notation particular though programming language mathematics usually index
In index usually start modern programming language computer programmer might use situation others might use forth
In mathematical context numbering used without confusion ordinal form well established meaning obvious candidate come instance function function obtained zero time
Such usage corresponds naming element properly belonging sequence preceding zeroth derivative really derivative
However precedes also original function precede
creator language precursor designed array initiating natural position start accessing array content language since value used address access position memory
Canadian system analyst Mike Hoye asked Richards reason choosing convention
BCPL first compiled language introduced indirection optimization provided array used compile time
The optimization nevertheless important batch process system could interrupted time calculate president racing yacht
later wrote pertinent note analyzing possible design array index enclosing chained inequality combining sharp standard inequality four possibility demonstrating conviction array best represented index range start zero alluding real number
Dijkstra criterion preferring convention detail represents empty sequence natural way
closed interval
interval natural length equal upper minus lower bound give possible value natural
This usage follows design choice embedded many influential including
In three sequence type C array Java array list Lisp list vector indexed beginning zero subscript
Particularly C array closely tied arithmetic make simpler implementation subscript refers offset starting position array first element offset zero
Referencing memory address offset represented directly virtually computer architecture design detail C make compilation easier cost human factor
In context using zeroth ordinal strictly correct widespread habit profession
Other programming language array subscript starting one meant correspondence usual
Some recent language adopted convention reason
Zero lowest unsigned integer value one fundamental type programming hardware design
In computer science thus often used base case many kind numerical
Proofs sort mathematical reasoning computer science often begin zero
For reason computer science unusual number zero rather one
Hackers computer scientist often like call first chapter publication Chapter especially introductory nature
One classic instance First Edition
In recent year trait also observed among many many construction defined numbered
If array used represent cycle convenient obtain index result zero
With numbering range expressed opposed closed interval
Empty range often occur algorithm tricky express closed interval without resorting obtuse convention like
Because property indexing potentially reduces
On hand repeat count calculated advance making use counting inclusive le intuitive
Some author prefer indexing corresponds closely entity indexed context
Another property convention use implemented modern computer
Usually map integer modulo one number
Because many formula algorithm calculating hash table index elegantly expressed code using modulo operation array index start zero
Pointer operation also expressed elegantly index due underlying logic mentioned
To illustrate suppose first element array index desired element
To compute address desired element index number count desired address computed expression size element
In contrast index number count expression becomes This simpler expression efficient compute
Note however language wishing index array could adopt convention every array address represented rather using address first array element language would use address imaginary element located immediately first actual element
The indexing expression index would following Hence efficiency benefit run time indexing inherent artifact decision represent array address first element rather address imaginary element preceding array
However address imaginary element located immediately first actual element array could well address item memory related array
This situation lead confusion terminology
In indexing scheme first element element number zero likewise twelfth element element number eleven
Therefore analogy ordinal number quantity object numbered appears highest index object referred th element
For reason first element often referred element avoid confusion
In many sequence number indexed nonnegative integer example
The formulated first second third law considered fundamental thus name
In biology organism said zero order intentionality show intention anything
This would include situation organism genetically predetermined phenotype result fitness benefit intend express gene
In similar sense computer may considered perspective zero order intentional entity intend express code program run
In biological medical experiment initial measurement made experimental time passed said day experiment
In genomics system used genome coordinate
Patient zero initial investigation
The exist widely used predecessor
Under system year followed
However year zero coincides Julian year BC coincides Gregorian year BC well
In many country building considered floor number rather Floor naming convention usually found United States America
This make consistent set underground floor marked negative number
While ordinal rarely used outside community closely connected mathematics physic computer science instance classical music
The composer regarded early unworthy including canon work wrote nicht score circle crossbar intending mean invalid
But posthumously work came known even though actually written
There even earlier Bruckner sometimes called
The Russian composer also wrote Symphony No

In university including Oxford Cambridge week occasionally noughth week refers week first week lecture term
In Australia university refer O Week serf pun
As parallel introductory week university education generally called nollning zeroing
The start basic training Wednesday first week eight considered begin following Sunday
The four day Sunday often referred Zero Week
international standard use denote beginning day
In train station

The around called
It built ring road around Brussels capital city deemed deserving basic number
Zero sometimes used especially scheme even number one side street odd number
A case point landmark whose address Garden Street
In Formula One defending world champion compete following season number assigned driver one driver world champion team carry number number
This happen Damon Hill carrying number season defending champion Nigel Mansell quit defending champion Alain Prost quit
A chronological prequel series may numbered
The number certain class rolling stock zero example
In realm fiction eventually added Zeroth Law essentially making four law

A contiguous block described single entry
It smallest unit data memory management virtual memory
Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation
Starting processor support MiB page called MiB page using addition standard KiB page newer processor newer processor later processor use GiB page
support many eight different page size KiB MiB architecture similar feature
Larger page despite available processor used contemporary common use except application application typically found large server operating system
Commonly use requires elevated privilege cooperation application making large allocation usually setting flag ask operating system huge page manual administrator configuration operating system commonly sometimes design page disk
However support multiple page size
Each individual process provide hint operating system automatically use largest page size possible given region address space
supported huge page several architecture since series via filesystem without hugetlbfs since
newer support huge page name page
support large page internally expose application
beginning version support large page
FreeBSD feature superpages
Note recently Linux application needed modified order use huge page
The kernel introduced support transparent use huge page
On Linux kernel supporting transparent huge page well FreeBSD Solaris application take advantage huge page automatically without need modification

This lesson introduce concept Computer Science explain Computer Scientist
It also give student opportunity assume role computer scientist
By end activity student reminder learned
You may tempted skip teaching young child vocabulary word associated lesson follow presenting fun playful light far productive waiting advanced opportunity

By The information age causing fundamental change aspect life I believe individual organization nation position future benefit enormously
In particular major opportunity right starting career computer science research
My professional career started I graduated Stanford electrical engineering
I hired assistant professor Princeton electrical engineering department
There computer science department
Fortunately Ed McCluskey asked teach course computer science
There book I ask content course
He gave four paper told I covered would fine
What I realize teaching course made one world first computer scientist
Whenever someone looking senior computer scientist I probably short list
That probably President George
Bush appointed National Science Board oversees National Science Foundation
Imagine I high energy particle physic
I would still waiting today senior faculty ahead retire I could good opportunity
When I tell story student today respond saying I lucky started career computer science beginning
The message I giving starting today starting time fundamental change position future great career
In past year computer science concerned making computer useful developing programming language compiler operating system database
Today focused computer used
We need develop science base support new direction course update curriculum student trained relevant aspect
Some topic future The field become much application oriented
The theory support new direction include This post based talk I gave Heidelberg Laureates Form September
In talk I discussed science base topic sparse vector digitization medical record community social network large graph high dimensional data dimension reduction
One example science base high dimension fact volume sphere high dimension go zero dimension increase
If consider data generated unit variance Gaussian centered origin probability mass within sphere radius one centered origin even though probability distribution maximum value
When one integrates probability distribution unit radius sphere integral zero since sphere volume
In fact probability mass one go distance equal square root dimension since radius sphere sphere nonzero volume
The gist example intuition fail u high dimension always generalize result low dimension high dimension

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

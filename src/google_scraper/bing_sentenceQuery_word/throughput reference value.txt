Throughput one misunderstood performance testing concept new tester sometimes struggle
So throughput
Basically Throughput amount transaction produced time test
It also expressed amount capacity website application handle
Also starting performance test common throughput goal application need able handle specific number request per hr
For example Let imagine gas station attendant fill car gas tank using gas pump
Let also say always take gas attendant one minute fill car matter big low car gas tank
Let call gas station Joe Gas envision three gas pump
Naturally three gas pump three car follows Joe attendant fill three car per minute
So fill performance report Joe gas station would show Joe throughput three car per minute
This Joe dilemma matter many car need gas maximum number handled specific time frame always
This maximum throughput fixed upper bound constraint
As vehicle enter gas pump line required wait thus creating queue
It concept applies testing web application
If web app receives request per second handle transaction per second request end waiting queue
When presenting performance test result throughput performance often expressed
I use HP come throughput monitor performance testing
But tool like similar meter
In typical test scenario user begin ramping making request throughput created increase well
Once user logged processing steady state throughput even since load user make stay relatively constant
If wanted find environment throughput upper bound would continue increasing number user
Eventually certain amount user added throughput start even may even drop
If throughput enters state however usually due kind bottleneck application
Below LoadRunner throughput chart result test I recently ran
Notice logged work throughput stay fairly consistent
This expected
Now notice throughput look like test perform well last example
All user log start working user logged making request would expect throughput flatline
But fact see plummet
This good
As I mentioned earlier throughput behavior like example usually bottleneck
By overlaying throughput chart HP Diagnostics Transaction Time Spent Element chart see bottleneck appears database layer In particular test request processed web server back end work queued due database issue
As additional request sent back end queue kept growing user response time increased
To learn HP Diagnostics check I configured LoadRunner able get metric video To recap Throughput key concept good performance tester understand one top metric used measure well application performing
I also written post concept performance test engineer know For detail info performance testing make sure grab copy
Also make sure check interview biggest name performance testing discover even performance testing awesomeness
No Comment In blog post Joe Colantonio explains detail clearly concept throughput performance testing one top metric used measure well application performing

I recently purchased router throughput listed
After receiving router configuring I speed test
Across different speed test site I getting speed well
Based manufacturer data sheet I expect high speed
Can someone explain throughput mean
This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason There two main issue consider determining router throughput
That sound rather obvious
A router receives packet process sends packet way proceeds next packet
A router performance throughput measured many packet process packet per second pps
This mean router throughput bandwidth fixed number varies packet size
A router process packet per second bandwidth troughput Mbps packet Kbps packet
To compensate effect router spec sheet generally list troughput bandwidth using packet balanced mix small medium large packet
A router throughput significantly reduced router packet simply route
If router firewalling NAT quality service IPSec processing packet take significantly CPU power
This mean le packet per second throughput lower bandwidth
In general manufacturer try make specsheet using fair common use scenario
If speedtest us different scenario result also different
As aside also make hard compare specsheets competing vendor know base measurement scenario

Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

Throughput refers much data transferred one location another given amount time
It used measure performance well Internet network connection
For example hard drive maximum transfer rate twice throughput drive transfer data Mbps
Similarly Mbps wireless connection roughly time much throughput Mbps connection
However actual data transfer speed may limited factor Internet connection speed network traffic
Therefore good remember maximum throughput device network may significantly higher actual throughput achieved everyday use

In general voting membership board supreme governing body institution member sometimes chosen board
Other name include
It may also called executive board often simply referred board
Typical duty board director include The legal responsibility board board member vary nature organization jurisdiction
For responsibility typically much rigorous complex type
Typically board chooses one member usually called chair chairperson hold whatever title specified
However membership organization member elect president organization president becomes chair board unless bylaw say otherwise
The director organization person member board
Several specific term categorize director presence absence relationship organization
An inside director director also employee officer chief executive major someone similarly connected organization
Inside director represent interest entity often special knowledge inner working financial market position
Typical inside director An inside director employed manager executive organization sometimes referred executive director confused title sometimes used CEO position organization
Executive director often specified area responsibility organization finance marketing human resource production
An outside director member board otherwise employed engaged organization represent stakeholder
A typical example director firm different industry
Outside director employee company affiliated way
Outside director bring outside experience perspective board
For example company serf domestic market presence CEOs global multinational corporation outside director help provide insight export import opportunity international trade option
One argument outside director keep watchful eye inside director way organization run
Outside director unlikely tolerate insider dealing insider director outside director benefit company organization
Outside director often useful handling dispute inside director shareholder board
They thought advantageous objective present little risk conflict interest
On hand might lack familiarity specific issue connected organization governance might know industry sector organization operating
Individual director often serve one board
This practice result relatively small number individual significant influence large number important entity
This situation important corporate social economic legal consequence subject significant research
The process running board sometimes called includes selection board member setting clear board objective dissemination document board member collaborative creation meeting creation assigned assessment board process standardized assessment board member owner CEOs
The science process slow develop due secretive nature way company run board however standardization beginning develop
Some pushing standardization USA Consulting
A board director conduct meeting according rule procedure contained governing document
These procedure may allow board conduct business mean
They may also specify determined
Most organization adopted guide supplement rule
In book rule conducting board meeting may le formal dozen board member present
An example informality required clear discussed
Historically nonprofit board uncommonly large board member modern trend smaller board small six seven people
Studies suggest seven people additional person reduces effectiveness
The role responsibility board director vary depending nature type business entity law applying entity see
For example nature business entity may one traded public market public company traded public market private limited closely held company owned family member family business exempt income tax profit entity
There numerous type business entity available throughout world corporation limited liability company cooperative business trust partnership private limited company public limited company
Much written board director relates board director business entity actively traded public market
More recently however material becoming available board private closely held business including family business
A organization one whose board rather accountable base member election power membership extremely limited
In society made member certain profession one advocating certain cause board director may responsibility running organization meeting membership especially membership meet infrequently
The amount power authority delegated board depend bylaw rule particular organization
Some organization place matter exclusively board control others general membership retains full power board make recommendation
The setup board director vary widely across organization may include provision applicable corporation shareholder member organization
A difference may membership elect officer organization president secretary officer become member board addition director retain duty board
The director may also classified officer situation
There may also member board person member due another position hold
These member right board member
Members board may removed term complete
Details removed usually provided bylaw
If bylaw contain detail section disciplinary procedure may used
In director elected represent legally obligated fiduciary represent owner
In capacity establish policy make decision issue whether much distributed employee
Theoretically control company divided two body board director
In practice amount power exercised board varies type company
In small private company director shareholder normally people thus real division power
In large board tends exercise supervisory role individual responsibility management tends delegated downward individual professional executive finance director marketing director deal particular area company affair
Another feature board director large public company board tends power
Many shareholder grant proxy director vote share general meeting accept recommendation board rather try get involved management since shareholder power well interest information small
Larger institutional investor also grant board proxy
The large number shareholder also make hard organize
However move recently try increase among institutional investor individual small shareholding
A contrasting view large public company upper management board wield practical power board delegate nearly power top executive employee adopting recommendation almost without fail
As practical matter executive even choose director shareholder normally following management recommendation voting
In case serving board unto
For major corporation board member usually professional leader field
In case outside director often senior leader organization
Nevertheless board member often receive remuneration amounting hundred thousand dollar per year since often sit board several company
Inside director usually paid sitting board duty instead considered part larger job description
Outside director usually paid service
These remuneration vary corporation usually consist yearly monthly salary additional compensation meeting attended stock option various benefit
travel hotel meal expense board meeting
example pay director annual retainer additional annual retainer director also chairperson committee fee meeting attended person fee meeting attended via telephone addition stock option retirement benefit
In European country two separate board executive board business elected shareholder employee supervising executive board
In country CEO chief executive managing director presides executive board chairman presides supervisory board two role always held different people
This ensures distinction executive board supervisory board allows clear line authority
The aim prevent much power concentrated hand one person
There strong parallel structure government tends separate political management
In United States board director elected shareholder often equivalent supervisory board executive board may often known executive committee operating committee executive council composed CEO direct report officer head
The development separate board director company occurred incrementally indefinitely legal history
Until end century seems generally assumed general meeting shareholder supreme organ company board director merely acted agent company subject control shareholder general meeting
However made clear decision Ch division power board shareholder general meaning depended construction power management vested board general meeting could interfere lawful exercise
The article held constitute contract member agreed director director alone shall manage
The new approach secure immediate approval endorsed AC since received general acceptance
Under English law successive version reinforced norm unless director acting contrary law provision Articles power conducting management affair company vested
The modern doctrine expressed KB follows A company entity distinct alike shareholder director
Some power may according article exercised director certain power may reserved shareholder general meeting
If power management vested director alone exercise power
The way general body shareholder control exercise power article director altering article opportunity arises article refusing director whose action disapprove
They usurp power article vested director director usurp power vested article general body shareholder
It remarked development law somewhat surprising time relevant provision seemed contradict approach rather endorse
In legal system appointment removal director voted upon shareholder general meeting
For publicly traded company director available vote largely selected either board whole
Although required nominating committee consist independent director condition listing nomination committee historically received input management selection even CEO position board
Shareholder nomination occur general meeting prohibitively expensive process mailing ballot separately May SEC proposed new rule allowing shareholder meeting certain criterion add nominee proxy statement
In practice publicly traded company manager purportedly accountable board director historically played major role selecting nominating director voted shareholder case gray outsider director independent director conflict interest nominated elected
Directors may also leave office resignation death
In legal system director may also removed resolution remaining director country may cause others power unrestricted
Some jurisdiction also permit board director appoint director either fill vacancy arises resignation death addition existing director
In practice quite difficult remove director resolution general meeting
In many legal system director right receive special notice resolution remove company must often supply copy proposal director usually entitled heard meeting
The director may require company circulate representation wish make
Furthermore director contract service usually entitle compensation removed may often include generous also act deterrent removal
A recent study examines corporate shareholder voted director election United States
It found director received fewer vote shareholder company performed poorly excess CEO compensation poor shareholder protection
Also director received fewer vote regularly attend board meeting received negative recommendation proxy advisory firm
The study also show company often improve corporate governance removing classified board reducing excessive CEO pay director receive low shareholder support
Board accountability shareholder recurring issue
In noted several director overseen company failed found new position director
The SEC sometimes imposes ban D O bar serving board part fraud case one upheld
The exercise board director power usually occurs board meeting
Most legal system require sufficient notice given director meeting must present business may conducted
Usually meeting held without notice given still valid director attend held failure give notice may negate resolution passed meeting persuasive oratory minority director might persuaded majority change mind vote otherwise
In country power board vested board whole individual director
However instance individual director may still bind company act virtue see also
Because director exercise control management organization organization theory run benefit law imposes strict duty director relation exercise duty
The duty imposed director duty similar law imposes similar position trust
The duty apply director separately power apply board jointly
Also duty owed company entity
This mean director never stand fiduciary relationship individual shareholder may well duty certain circumstance
Directors must exercise power proper purpose
While many instance improper purpose readily evident director looking feather nest divert investment opportunity relative breach usually involve breach director duty act good faith
Greater difficulty arise director acting good faith serving purpose regarded law proper
The seminal authority relation amount proper purpose decision December
The case concerned power director company disenfranchise voting right attached share failure properly comply notice served shareholder
Prior case leading authority AC
The case concerned power director issue new
It alleged director issued large number new share purely deprive particular shareholder voting majority
An argument power issue share could properly exercised raise new capital rejected narrow held would proper exercise director power issue share larger company ensure financial stability company part agreement exploit mineral right owned company
If mere fact incidental result even desired consequence shareholder lost majority takeover bid defeated would make share issue improper
But sole purpose destroy voting majority block takeover bid would improper purpose
Not jurisdiction recognised proper purpose duty separate good faith duty however
Directors without consent company fetter relation exercise power bind vote particular way future board meeting
This even improper motive purpose personal advantage director
This mean however board agree company entering contract bind company certain course even certain action course require board approval
The company remains bound director retain discretion vote taking future action although may involve breach company board previously approved
As fiduciary director may put position interest duty conflict duty owe company
The law take view good faith must done must manifestly seen done zealously patrol conduct director regard allow director escape liability asserting decision fact well founded
Traditionally law divided conflict duty interest three
By definition director enters transaction company conflict director interest well transaction duty company ensure company get much transaction
This rule strictly enforced even conflict duty purely hypothetical director forced disgorge personal gain arising
In Macq HL stated judgment However many jurisdiction member company permitted ratify transaction would otherwise fall foul principle
It also largely accepted jurisdiction principle overridden company constitution
In many country also statutory duty declare interest relation transaction director fined failing make disclosure
Directors must without informed consent company use profit company asset information
This prohibition much le flexible prohibition transaction company attempt circumvent using provision article met limited success
In All ER House Lords upholding regarded wholly unmeritorious claim shareholder held And accordingly director required disgorge profit made shareholder received windfall
The decision followed several subsequent case regarded settled law
Directors compete directly company without conflict interest arising
Similarly act director competing company duty company would conflict
Traditionally level care skill demonstrated director framed largely reference director
In Ch expressed purely subjective term court held However decision based firmly older notion see prevailed time mode corporate decision making effective control residing shareholder elected put incompetent decision maker recourse complain
However modern approach since developed BCLC court held rule related skill diligence
With respect diligence required This dual subjective objective test one deliberately pitched higher level
More recently suggested test skill diligence assessed objectively subjectively United Kingdom statutory provision relating director duty new codified basis
In jurisdiction law provides variety remedy event breach director duty Historically director duty owed almost exclusively company member board expected exercise power company
However recently attempt soften position provide scope director act good corporate citizen
For example United Kingdom requires director company promote success company benefit member whole set following six factor regarding director duty promote success This represents considerable departure traditional notion director duty owed company
Previously United Kingdom protection stakeholder considerably limited see example permitted director take account interest employee could enforced shareholder employee
The change therefore subject criticism
The introduced new standard accountability board company company listed
Under Act director risk large fine prison sentence case accounting crime
direct responsibility director
The vast majority company covered Act hired internal auditor ensure company adheres required standard internal control
The internal auditor required law report directly audit board consisting director half outside director one financial expert
The law requires company listed major stock exchange NYSE NASDAQ majority independent otherwise employed firm business relationship
According Corporate Library study average size publicly traded company board member board range member
According Investopedia analyst think ideal size seven
State law may specify minimum number director maximum number director qualification director
whether board member must individual may business entity
While board may several committee compensation committee audit critical must made least three inside director
Other common committee board nominating governance
Directors company received median pay
Directorship job
A recent National Association Corporate Directors study found director averaging hour week board work
Surveys indicate pay board member American
nonprofit organization require board member personally contribute organization recommends
This percentage increased recent year
According John Gillespie former investment banker book critical board Far much time activity rather real monitoring executive providing strategic advice behalf shareholder
At time scholar found individual director large effect major corporate initiative merger acquisition investment
The issue subject much criticism recent year
Governments corporation responded measure legislation mandating gender quota system address disproportionality gender representation corporate board
A study French corporate elite found certain social class also disproportionately represented board upper especially class tending dominate

Rapid application development RAD suite software development methodology technique used expedite software application development
RAD us predefined prototyping technique tool produce software application
It encompasses graphical user interface GUI development environment allowing end user easily drag drop required software application component
Software RAD technique employ software engineering CASE
RAD popular software development methodology employing various tool technique quickly produce software application
RAD essence prototyping creating predefined component structure method quickly develop software model
RAD working software prototype lack functionality
They used primarily demonstration requirement gathering help end user envision entire solution stack
RAD contains customizeable data process organizational model
Thus employ approach developing complete solution

general term used refer alternative conventional software development well name approach rapid development
In general RAD approach software development put le emphasis planning emphasis process
In contrast waterfall model call rigorously defined specification established prior entering development phase RAD approach emphasize adaptability necessity adjusting requirement response knowledge gained project progress
Prototypes often used addition sometimes even place design specification
RAD especially well suited although limited developing software driven user interface requirement
often called rapid application development tool
Other approach rapid development include
Rapid application development response process developed
One problem method based traditional engineering model used design build thing like bridge building
Software inherently different kind artifact
Software radically change entire process used solve problem
As result knowledge gained development process feed back requirement design solution
The waterfall solution try rigidly define requirement plan implement process discouraged change either
The new RAD approach hand recognized software development knowledge intensive process sought develop flexible process could take advantage knowledge gained life project use knowledge reinvent solution
The first RAD alternative developed Barry Boehm known spiral model
Boehm subsequent RAD approach emphasized developing prototype well instead rigorous design specification
Prototypes several advantage traditional specification Starting idea others developed rapid application development approach finally formalized publishing book
This resulted confusion term RAD even among IT professional
It important distinguish RAD general alternative waterfall model RAD specific method created Martin
The Martin method tailored toward knowledge intensive UI intensive business system
These idea developed improved upon RAD pioneer like James Kerr Richard Hunter together wrote seminal book subject Inside RAD followed journey RAD project manager drove refined RAD Methodology actual RAD project
These practitioner like helped RAD gain popularity alternative traditional system project life cycle approach
The RAD approach also matured period peak interest
The idea business process radically rethink core business process sale customer support new capability Information Technology mind
RAD often essential part larger business engineering program
The rapid prototyping approach RAD key tool help user analyst think box innovative way technology might radically reinvent core business process
The James Martin approach RAD divide process four distinct phase In modern Information Technology environment many system built using degree Rapid Application Development necessarily James Martin approach
In addition Martin method often used RAD development
The advantage RAD include The disadvantage RAD include

Rapid Application Development Definition RAD A general term describes kind system development us modern tool technique develop system quicker better result normal

A programming system enables quickly build working
In general RAD system provide number tool help build would normally take large development effort
Two popular RAD system
Historically RAD system tended emphasize reducing development time sometimes expense generating efficient
Nowadays though many RAD system produce extremely fast code
Conversely many traditional programming environment come number visual tool aid development
Therefore line RAD system development environment become blurred

Relative address mean specified indicating distance another address called
For example relative address might B base address distance called
There two type addressing
In absolute addressing specify actual address called location
Relative absolute addressing used variety circumstance
In use either identify location
Relative addressing always byte usually need worry address unless programmer
In use either mode designate particular
Programs like Microsoft Excel us relative addressing default
This mean copy formula increment letter formula default option
Absolute Addressing happens lock formula cell change pasted another cell
In Excel relative absolute addressing frequently called relative absolute

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

A general form specifies unique location
A path point file system location following directory tree hierarchy expressed path component separated delimiting character represent directory
The delimiting character commonly character colon though may use different
Paths used extensively represent relationship common modern operating system essential construction URLs
Resources represented either
Multics first introduced hierarchical file system directory separated
Around Unix introduced slash character directory separator
In first version Microsoft DOS released
support file directory
Also major portion utility command packaged came IBM command line syntax used slash character prefix
For example run command wide list format option
This use slash still found command interface Windows
By contrast Unix us dash character command line switch prefix
When directory support added version kept switch prefix character backwards compatibility
Microsoft chose backslash character directory separator look similar slash character
An path point location file system regardless current
To must include
By contrast path start given working directory avoiding need provide full absolute path
A considered relative path based current working directory
If working directory file result file addressed name
note also used reference root current user library current working directory respectively
When filesystems filename extension mounted
character changed example
note prefix may number boot volume AppleShare home directory Japanese Korean version Windows may often display character character instead directory separator
In case code backslash drawn character
Very early version replaced backslash glyph display make possible display program understood character square bracket replaced well see
Although even first version Windows supported character set Yen sign modern version Windows support Won sign much software continue display backslashes found ASCII file way preserve backwards compatibility
derivative UNIX us UNIX path internally
However preserve compatibility software familiarity user many portion GUI switch typed user internally switch back displaying filename entered user also changed inverse translation happen
The Microsoft Windows short specifies common syntax describe location network resource shared file directory printer
The UNC syntax Windows system generic form Microsoft often refers
Some Microsoft Windows interface also allow require UNC syntax share access rather URL
The UNC syntax extended optional component denote use SSL port number WebDAV URL becomes When viewed remotely SharedFolder may name different program server see opening
Instead SharedFolder name consists arbitrary name assigned folder defining sharing
Some Microsoft Windows interface also accept Long UNC Microsoft Windows us following type path In version Windows prior Windows XP APIs accept Long UNC could accept character
The allows path name character long
Since UNCs start two backslashes backslash also used string escaping result extreme case escaped string regular expression matching UNC begin backslashes string regular expression require escaping
This simplified using C Python regular expression literal Perl
Most system use similar syntax
allows treating path beginning two slash manner though case system must treat multiple slash single slash
Many application system example use resource definition like service name The following worked example discus behavior would appear terminal terminal application window Attached current working directory cwd One want change current working directory At moment desired represented short absolute path directory Given relative path directory wanted following may typed change current working directory bobapples Two dot point upwards indicate one dot represents current directory
Both component complex relative path alone first component relative path represents
Using refer file current working directory sometimes usefully distinguish resource found default directory mean example view specific version instead one installed system
Contrary popular belief accepts slash thus Unix example work
But many application Windows interpret slash purpose treat invalid character thus require enter backslash notably shell often called terminal typically run terminal window
Note many shell available Windows allow slash
In addition indicate single root instead root current disk
Indicating file disk current one requires prefixing drive letter colon
No ambiguity ensues colon valid character filename thus one file called A current directory
UNC name path starting support slash
The following example show path backslashes used match common syntax This path point file name located directory turn located root directory drive
This path refers file called located parent directory current directory drive
This path denotes file called located directory turn located directory located current directory current drive since example give
This rather simple path point file named located current directory since path lack current drive since drive specification present
This path refers first
This example us path containing slash directory separator
The command redirects content file command
A path containing forward slash often need surrounded double quote disambiguate
CD drive letter Files work root drive letter directory
This appears treat forward slash
For example work Also root folder would treated If relative path directory name specified forward slash get following error For setting environment variable sometimes necessary provide path contain space instance defined C cause script halt encounter space path name
To get name Windows assigns directory substitution environment variable use directory listing command option one level target directory
For instance following get eight character name directory directly root

relative address A memory address represents distance starting point base address first byte program table
The absolute address derived adding base address

In case branch Instructions use addressing
But I really clear said book MIPS address calculating branch target actually relative address following instruction opposed current instruction
Anybody please explain
Thanks
This question came site computer enthusiast power user
Branch instruction MIPS offset value provide offset byte
This offset added Next PC value rather PC branch
Why NPC used rather PC branch obvious
This may related use Stanford MIPS project assembler performed limited instruction reordering filling delayed branch slot previous instruction
With design offset forward branch branch positive offset commonly used implement conditionally branching clause would never changed conversion offset backward branch branch negative offset commonly used loop would changed delay slot filled extra instruction
This might simplify compiler development
An alternative speculation would slightly simplified initial implementation branch evaluated second pipeline stage current PC NPC relative branch instruction
A third speculation considered conceptually cleaner given use delayed branch slot
The offset becomes relative instruction branch activated
As comment say probably easier fit add displacement target increment PC sub step instruction execution one done early
This wo make much difference reach forward somewhat greater backwards might affect corner case
In case I met assembler
implemented long branch equal By posting answer agree

In within object indicating distance displacement beginning object given element point presumably within object
The concept distance valid element object size typically given
For example character containing fourth element containing character offset three start
In programming usually denotes number address location added order get specific
In original meaning offset basic address unit usually used specify offset size
In context offset sometimes called
In instruction offset embedded within certain instruction provided range byte
For example within unconditional branch instruction xxx hexadecimal offset provided byte offset base register branch
An odd offset would cause unless base register also contained odd address since instruction aligned boundary execute without program hardware
The previous example describes indirect way address memory location format segment offset
For example assume want refer memory location
One way accomplished first defining segment beginning address defining offset
Further also allowed shift hexadecimal segment reach final absolute memory address
One thing note reach final absolute address many way

They seem explicitly specify real memory location
What difference physical absolute address

deal A address used bus circuitry hence transferring data RAM
Its counterpart
computer virtual memory virtual address used application translated physical address actually accessing RAM
The application see virtual address
This mean memory reference application code refer virtual address
actually term used referring one used application
Thus computer offer virtual memory address virtual address application code going refer virtual address
Other addressing mode use virtual address well
Of course like I wrote earlier virtual address eventually mapped physical address accessing RAM
Here address different counterpart addressing mode one address An Intel jump instruction may specify jump displacement relative next instruction
Something like Jump N byte next instruction Or may used absolute address like Jump Nth byte memory In case address referred virtual address get mapped physical address way transparent application By posting answer agree

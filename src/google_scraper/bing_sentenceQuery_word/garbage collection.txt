The attempt reclaim memory occupied longer use
Garbage collection invented around simplify manual memory management
Garbage collection often portrayed opposite requires programmer specify object deallocate return memory system
However many system use combination approach including technique
Like memory management technique garbage collection may take significant proportion total processing time program result significant influence performance
With good implementation enough memory depending application garbage collection faster manual memory management opposite also true often case past GC algorithm
Resources memory database device descriptor typically handled garbage collection
Methods used manage resource particularly may suffice manage memory well leaving need GC
Some GC system allow resource associated region memory collected cause resource reclaimed called
Finalization may introduce complication limiting usability intolerable latency disuse reclaim especially limited resource lack control performs work reclaiming
The basic principle garbage collection find data object program accessed future reclaim resource used object
Many require garbage collection either part example effectively practical implementation example formal language like said
Other language designed use manual memory management implementation available example
Some language like allow garbage collection application using separate collected manually managed object others like allow user manually delete object also entirely disable garbage collection speed required
While integrating garbage collection language enables much wider choice method GC system exist including require recompilation
GC sometimes distinguished
The garbage collector almost always closely integrated
Garbage collection free programmer manually dealing memory deallocation
As result certain category eliminated substantially reduced Some bug addressed garbage collection security implication
Typically garbage collection certain disadvantage including consuming additional resource performance impact possible stall program execution incompatibility manual resource management
Garbage collection consumes computing resource deciding memory free even though programmer may already known information
The penalty convenience annotating object lifetime manually source code lead decreased uneven performance
A paper came conclusion GC need five time memory compensate overhead perform fast explicit memory management
Interaction memory hierarchy effect make overhead intolerable circumstance hard predict detect routine testing
The impact performance also given Apple reason adopting garbage collection despite desired feature
The moment garbage actually collected unpredictable resulting stall pause memory scattered throughout session
Unpredictable stall unacceptable interactive program
Incremental concurrent garbage collector address problem varying
The modern GC implementation try minimize blocking stall much work possible background
separate thread example marking unreachable garbage instance application process continues run
In spite advancement example still difficult maintain large heap million object resident object get promoted older generation without incurring noticeable delay sometimes second
GC incompatible based management resource
As result need explicit manual resource management resource becomes transitive composition
That GC system resource object requires manual resource management object used part another object composed object also become object requires manual resource management
common type garbage collection much garbage collection often refers tracing garbage collection rather method
The overall strategy consists determining object garbage collected tracing object chain reference certain root object considering rest garbage collecting
However large number algorithm used implementation widely varying complexity performance characteristic
Reference counting garbage collection object count number reference
Garbage identified reference count zero
An object reference count incremented reference created decremented reference destroyed
When count reach zero object memory reclaimed
As manual memory management unlike tracing garbage collection reference counting guarantee object destroyed soon last reference destroyed usually access memory either CPU cache object freed directly pointed thus tends significant negative side effect CPU cache virtual memory operation
There number disadvantage reference counting generally solved mitigated sophisticated algorithm used convert thus reducing amount work needed done garbage collector
This done using analysis determine whether object allocated within function accessible outside
escape function thread
In case object may allocated directly thread stack released function return reducing potential garbage collection overhead
Generally speaking likely garbage collection standard feature
In language built garbage collection added library C
Most garbage collection built
especially notable first first language introduce garbage collection
Other dynamic language version use reference counting also tend use GC
language usually provide integrated garbage collection
Notable exception
Historically language intended beginner often used garbage collection data type string list burden programmer manual memory management
On early microcomputer limited memory slow processor BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random inexplicable pause midst program operation
Some BASIC interpreter Apple II family repeatedly scanned string descriptor string highest address order compact toward high memory resulting performance could introduce pause execution program
A replacement garbage collector Applesoft BASIC published January page identified group string every pas heap cut collection time dramatically
released provided windowing garbage collector BASIC reduced collection fraction second
While traditionally garbage collection release introduced garbage collection using developed runtime collector
However release garbage collection deprecated favor ARC introduced
Furthermore since May Apple even forbids usage garbage collection new OS X application
For garbage collection never introduced due problem application responsivity performance instead iOS us ARC
Garbage collection rarely used system perceived need tight control use limited resource
However garbage collector compatible limited environment developed
The Microsoft embedded software platform like larger cousin include garbage collection
form allowing memory reused reclaimed based invariant known compilation
This form garbage collection studied saw greater usage introduction ARC Apple ecosystem iOS OS X
Incremental concurrent garbage collector developed algorithm algorithm
In Baker algorithm allocation done either half single region memory
When becomes half full garbage collection performed move live object half remaining object implicitly deallocated
The running program check object reference correct half move across background task finding object
scheme based empirical observation object die young
In generational garbage collection two allocation region generation kept kept separate based object age
New object created young generation regularly collected generation full object still referenced older region copied next oldest generation
Occasionally full scan performed
Some include hardware support garbage collection
Most implementation garbage collector
Such garbage collector meet constraint used operating system

In includes region memory computer system system resource used future computation system program running
As computer system finite amount memory frequently necessary garbage return memory pool underlying memory reused
Garbage generally classified two type object data never accessed running program combination program input refers object data within program memory space unreachable program
Objects data garbage said
Casually stated syntactic garbage data reached semantic garbage data reached
More precisely syntactic garbage data unreachable due reference graph path determined many algorithm discussed requires analyzing data code
Semantic garbage data accessed either unreachable hence also syntactic garbage reachable accessed latter requires analysis code general
Syntactic garbage usually strict subset semantic garbage entirely possible object hold reference another object without latter object used
In following simple stack implementation Java element popped stack become semantic garbage outside reference This still reference object object never accessed reference since private class method return reference element already popped decremented element never accessed class
However requires analysis code class undecidable general
If later call stack previous size overwriting last reference object become syntactic garbage since unreachable eligible garbage collection
An example automatic collection syntactic garbage garbage collection produced using In session object created location memory displayed reference object way ever use object point reference
This becomes apparent try access original reference As impossible refer object become useless object garbage
Since Python us garbage collection automatically deallocates memory used object may used Note instance resides memory location place previous object instance located
Since instance destroyed freeing memory used contain interpreter creates object memory location making good use available resource
Garbage consumes heap memory thus one wish collect minimize memory use allow faster memory allocation prevent error reducing heap fragmentation memory use
However collecting garbage take time done manually requires coding overhead
Further collecting garbage destroys object thus cause call executing potentially arbitrary code arbitrary point program execution
Incorrect garbage collection deallocating memory garbage primarily due error manual garbage collection rather error garbage collector result violation often security hole due use
Syntactic garbage collected automatically garbage collector extensively studied developed
Semantic garbage automatically collected general thus cause even language
Detecting eliminating semantic garbage typically done using specialized debugging tool called allows one see object live reachable enabling one remove unintended reference
The problem managing deallocation garbage one computer science

Garbage collection automatic memory management feature many modern programming language language framework
Languages use garbage collection often interpreted run within like
In case environment run code also responsible garbage collection
In older programming language allocating freeing memory done manually programmer
Memory data ca stored within primitive data type including object buffer string usually reserved heap
When program longer need data programmer free chunk data API call
Because process manually controlled human error introduce bug code
occur programmer forgets free memory program longer need
Other time programmer may try access chunk memory already freed leading dangling pointer cause serious bug even crash
Programs automatic garbage collector GC try eliminate bug automatically detecting piece data longer needed
A GC two goal unused memory freed memory freed unless program use anymore
Although language allow memory manually freed well many

submitted I heard topic called garbage collection relation different language YouTube video Jonathan Blow month ago never cared look
Is

Do recycling well
Post comment
The comment cover basic idea I tack idea worth keeping mind looking broader scope GC
The first issue whether heap managed native
Some thing like Boehm GC made embedded existing C program conservative collection work largely limited beyond since really know program ca thing like move object etc
Managed heap like Java example give much control GC see collector freely move object around come exotic object layout enhance locality object size
Recently work done area collection concurrent collection especially hardware assistance incremental collection aggressive related object
As cost memory access increase produce substantial performance benefit could statically determined human
I worked area several year interesting becomes possible look beyond free unused memory concern commonly associated GC
It tends
many language specifically require implementation collect garbage automatically
It absolutely need though instance GC library like boehm use conjunction I think principle
implementation could ignore call free instead collect garbage whenever feel like although would somewhat redundant user already explicitly specified free likely best point time actually
GCs recycling instance java VM allocate certain amount
big array memory initially started expanded runtime necessary allocate memory space program running requires
When object collected piece data array simply flagged unused may something else later part may
Occasionally something called compactification may happen avoid memory becoming fragmented
Also I think pretty much functional language require implementation provide GC least I never seen functional language allowed user explicit memory management malloc free inherently I think obvious whether would possible fit well fabric functional language GC various advantage disadvantage advantage user think resource ownership least memory resource user may still memory leak occur easily
On downside required run algorithm alongside program analyzes heap constantly figure object needed anymore free
This take CPU cycle make program le deterministic lose control memory freed job
different emphasize throughput emphasize
Some may even require completely stop program amount time analyze garbage
When performing sort operation create lot object
maybe parsing XML somesuch tree node GC may drastically impact performance compared solution memory precisely possible beforehand
That
many game rely GC instead memory need use specialized allocator strategy like linear allocator
Another slightly subtle issue may arise relying much many language rely GC provide good primitive managing resource ownership people rely GC managing resource designed handle handle optimally
One example many people embed lua program small
luas look size object figure collect
However almost everyone create object bulk substance either thing maybe even somewhere else entirely instance GPU memory case graphical object texture GC see maybe single pointer thus consider particularly important collect
That mean may end object lumping around main memory even video RAM think worth free timely manner
I aware real solution kind issue one aware careful
In language
rust modern
et al may give better primitive handle case like ownership et al user may issue
So summary GCs various advantage disadvantage le appropriate depending circumstance language used
It entirely accurate user think memory allocation GC language
For instance list implemented array reference start end index allow constant time indexing time would persistent memory leak filled emptied without nulling reference list gced
If list memory intensive element like say image quickly run memory
Memory management much easier Java similar still necessary
The advantage worry reference
The principle GC collect code access value
Whether use nilling specific strategy ensure hang onto unneeded garbage language specific eg
functional language use immutable data structure tend strong scoping rule practice letting value escape scope usually suffices ensure collected explicitly shadowing binding assigning STM value nil rare
Rather manually freeing memory language garbage collection automatically free memory unused object data
Most high level language lower level C notable one
It cause momentary lag collection happens inopportune time

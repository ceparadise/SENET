The data principle engineering concerned human performance behaviour training system design development system biological medical research
Because broad scope engineering draw upon part social physiological science anatomy anthropometry applied physiology psychology sociology toxicology well part engineering
Two general characterize approach engineer practical design work
The first engineer must solve problem human machine system rigorous scientific method rely logic common sense
In past typical engineer tended either ignore complex unpredictable nature deal summarily educated guess
engineer tried show appropriate technique possible identify mismatch usually possible find workable solution mismatch use method developed behavioral science
The second important approach typically design decision made without great deal trial error
There thousand engineer thousand thousand engineer world designing novel machine machine system environment much faster behavioral scientist accumulate data human respond
More problem therefore created ready answer specialist almost invariably forced resort trying thing various degree rigour find solution
Thus engineering aim substituting guesswork specific technique usually rather theoretical
engineer regard human element system model usual way representing relationship
The simplest model unit consists individual operator working single machine
In machine system human operator first sense referred machine display signal tell something condition functioning machine
A display may position pointer dial light flashing control panel readout sound warning buzzer spoken command issuing loudspeaker
Having sensed display operator interprets perhaps performs computation reach decision
In worker may use number human ability including ability remember compare current perception past experience coordinate perception strategy formed past perception past experience solve novel problem
Psychologists commonly refer activity higher mental function engineer generally refer
Having reached decision human operator normally take action
This action usually exercised kind pushbutton lever crank pedal switch handle
The action upon one control exerts influence machine output turn change display cycle continuously repeated
A system exist isolation exists sort
Since nature environment influence operator performance engineer must concerned environmental factor temperature humidity noise illumination acceleration vibration noxious gas contaminant
Driving automobile familiar example simple system
In driving operator receives input outside vehicle sound visual cue traffic obstruction signal display inside vehicle speedometer fuel indicator temperature gauge
The driver continually evaluates information decides course action translates decision action upon vehicle accelerator steering wheel brake
Finally driver influenced environmental factor noise fume temperature
The simple model provides convenient way organizing major concern human engineering selection design machine display control layout design workplace design maintainability work environment
No matter important may match individual operator machine challenging complex human problem arise design large system human operator system
Examples large system modern jet airliner automated post office industrial plant nuclear submarine space vehicle launch recovery system
In design system engineer study addition consideration previously mentioned three factor personnel training operating procedure
Systems generally designed particular kind operator
A space vehicle example designed highly select handful astronaut
Automobiles hand designed accommodate wide spectrum people
In large system specification personnel requirement part system design
Personnel trained given appropriate information skill required operate maintain system
System design includes development training technique program often extends design training device training aid
Instructions operating procedure rule set forth duty operator system specify system function
Tailoring operating rule requirement system people contributes greatly safe orderly efficient operation
The basis consideration information human user design tool machine job work always present
One oldest efficient human scythe show remarkable degree engineering undoubtedly reflecting modification made many century adroitly curved handle blade peg grasp left hand
All sharp contrast conventional snow shovel modern generally poor design blamed many wintertime back strain
The need formal approach human problem created machine became vastly complex ever
jet aircraft computer radar nuclear submarine communication satellite space product past decade
The fantastic growth number complexity machine created entirely new problem use human operator way system
Moreover solution new problem found wisdom society
For example long ago one way predicting certainty astronaut could would function weightless environment
engineering therefore child time born mechanized civilization
Applications engineering made simple device highway sign telephone set hand tool stove host modern sophisticated complex system automated factory warehouse robot space vehicle
The experience gained devising system contributed realization even relatively simple device raise unexpectedly important question human conventional engineering practice frequently answer
The modern telephone handset provides good example relatively simple device required great deal engineering
The layout key four row three button example selected extensive test variety arrangement circular two vertical row five button two horizontal row five diagonal pattern arrangement numeral letter key order left right top bottom chosen superior arrangement used many desk calculator number increase bottom top
The design decision simply matter logic test showed people actually made fewer error took le time arrangement calculator arrangement
Other consideration design keyset size style numeral letter maximum legibility optimum size spacing key proper characteristic key provide feedback feel button depressed
Similar factor considered designing shape handset
The location separation angle earpiece mouthpiece determined assembly would fit comfortably around greatest number different human face weight handset designed neither light heavy
In recent year careful design conventional telephone set become apparent contrast new arrival telephone marketplace generally inferior design quality
The designing much complicated device space suit present intricate problem
A space suit complete miniature world environment must supply everything needed astronaut life well comfort
The suit must provide pressurized interior without astronaut blood would boil vacuum space
The consequent pressure differential inside outside suit great inflated suit becomes distended rigid unyielding capsule
Special joint designed give astronaut much free movement possible
The best engineering able provide much flexibility movement desirable compensate lack attention directed toward design tool device astronaut must use
In addition overcoming pressurization movement problem space suit must provide oxygen system removing excess product respiration water vapour protection extreme heat cold radiation protection eye environment atmosphere absorb sun ray facility speech communication facility temporary storage body waste
This imposing list human requirement entire developed deal indeed provision simulated environment procedure testing evaluating space suit
Not engineering design commercially successful
An example typewriter keyboard
Several layout demonstrably superior point view proposed beginning far back
Despite test result show alternative layout easier learn create le operator fatigue permit faster typing traditional layout persists carried design million personal computer
In case inertia resistance change obstacle efficient ergonomic design design
The telephone space suit typewriter keyboard three thousand example might selected show engineering consciously applied solve technological problem
The principle method also applied variety social problem individualized nonlethal antiriot equipment law enforcement agency antiterrorist architecture public building people mover airport urban transportation department
The modern concern man relationship total environment implies definition engineering increasing supply problem ergonomic engineer future
encouraged development engineering ergonomics discipline attempt design equipment
For example new engineer try accommodate human physiology designing equipment operated comfortable work level minimum strain control easy reach see human resource management engineering particular design tool device used effectively without placing excessive demand people mental capacity engineering

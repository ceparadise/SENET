Our track record prof steady federal funding support lead success Thank Chairman Rockefeller Ranking Member Thune Committee privilege addressing today
My name Mariette DiChristina I editor chief chronicled power basic research since founding started first branch patent agency Thomas Edison among researcher visited office
Albert Einstein wrote Nobel laureate many winner National Medals Science Technology
It reach million print million month online including leader business policy educator student science enthusiast
Science engine prosperity
Economists said third half economic growth resulted basic research since World War II
The car train got u today smart phone energy light chamber clothes wear food eat All developed improved research
But application existed researcher study basic concept provided sound study necessarily knowing would lead
I know Einstein thinking GPS smart phone formulated theory relativity hundred year ago
But knowing spacetime work help make measurement orbiting GPS satellite accurate
And Elizabeth Blackburn curious end chromosome started studying DNA pond scum
The NIH started funding work
In fellow NIH grantee Carol Greider Jack Szostak Nobel work understanding end called telomere know play important role human cancer disease aging
Examples like Elizabeth Blackburn show providing steady sufficient support basic research national priority
We need take long view R D nation future need nurture child entire career succeed increasingly competitive global marketplace
Research take time
Typical funding grant average five year long
It take time run experiment gather data analyze properly confirm finding
And track record prof steady federal funding support lead success
federal funding key nearly percent almost top innovation identified R D Magazine
Our nation ability handle today pressing issue providing energy security curing illness living sustainably finite world require innovation arise basic research
It also provides good return
In particularly strong example Human Genome Project paid back job growth dollar invested
In general return publicly funded R D percent
Basic research inspiring
The Zooniverse Web site instance let anybody catalog heavenly object NASA image
It million volunteer citizen scientist
Thousands volunteer catalogued whale call year lab work
The Maker movement phenomenon Office Science Technology Policy holding Maker Faire event
Unfortunately since R D spending overall flattened even declined real dollar according report Congressional Budget Office R D Productivity Growth
Because length time needed research also sequester cut affect progress year come forestalled canceled work disproportionately affect discourage younger researcher
Meanwhile country China nipping heel
Earlier year China rate GDP investment surpassed member state European Union could exceed little half decade according Global R D Forecast Battelle R D Magazine
Japan Denmark Finland Germany Israel Sweden already spend greater percentage GDP research according World Bank
A strong STEM education pipeline also critical
Over past year STEM job grew fast say Department Commerce leading technology company often challenged fill necessary opening
For one view I turned member next generation
I told older daughter Selina plan double major computer science graphic design I speaking topic
I asked would say science
That easy mom said
It foundation And
Science system exploring innovation
It fuel nation economic growth
It form path young people competitive global marketplace
And fire imagination
That research deserves steady commitment investment
Thank kind attention

The External Specialization involves nine credit hour level
Absolutely CS course allowed
The three course must related
Frequently three course department OR IE Optimization I OR IE Optimization II OR IE Discrete Models
However great strength Cornell multitude interdisciplinary thread cut across departmental boundary
Thus Psychology Concepts Categories Word Meanings Philosophy Philosophy Language Linguistics Representation Structure Vision Language define acceptable Specialization
Not field created equal may challenge finding level course field others
Careful planning creative course selection especially important find field limited offering level
A student specializing Fine Arts example might find two level course offered department qualified take
That student must find third course perhaps one another field fill specialization
Another common example found field neurobiology much junior level work numbered level
Regardless departmental variance level course counted toward External Specialization
Finally mention course used External Specialization technical nature explicit connection CS
It arena wherein tap great intellectual resource University
The major elective course course approved CS major advisor
This elective requirement met multiple course totalling credit one course credit hour
Phys Ed course numbered ROTC course qualify academic credit used toward degree requirement CS
Six credit coursework academic program Cornell
mean justified selection advisor advisor approved selection
It make good sense use elective introductory course may required prerequisite technical elective course course used satisfy Specialization
Phys Ed course numbered ROTC course qualify academic credit used toward degree requirement CS
Up credit advisor approved elective may allowed ROTC course
Fifteen credit hour course outside CS
The course used category used fulfill degree requirement
Note It make good sense use Arts elective qualify course category
For example Psych Psychology Visual Communications Psych prerequisite

In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

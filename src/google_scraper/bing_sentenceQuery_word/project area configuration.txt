A computer networking project making Ethernet cable used connecting local area network LANs school project high school college student
With project student form group three four receive material instructor make Ethernet cable correctly
Materials needed project include cable modular plug crimping tool
Students untwist cable arrange color proper order crimp wire insert modular plug
After making cable instructor test Ethernet cable testing device student test cable connecting computer already set local area network
Network design project allow student use creativity working computer network
With project instructor hand list scenario require design computer network
Scenarios could include business office need setup LAN bank branch office need Internet connection wide area network WAN city want implement metropolitan area network MAN resident
Students design network make presentation design explaining hardware
server VPN router workstation connection method
Ethernet etc software needed set manage computer network
Students use free network diagram program SmartDraw Gliffy Edraw Soft make graphical representation network
A computer networking project student take involves network security
In type project instructor hand scenario group student computer network
Students review network design look internal external hole security leaf network vulnerable intruder outsider
The group student use presentation network diagram software tool map explain additional step need taken improve security internal external network
Solutions improving network security may include adding firewall device implementing configuring network management software changing network infrastructure connection method

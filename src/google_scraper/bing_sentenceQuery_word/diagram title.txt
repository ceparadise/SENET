A symbolic according technique
Diagrams used since ancient time became prevalent
Sometimes technique us visualization onto surface
The word sometimes used diagram
The term diagram commonly used sense general specific meaning In science term used way
For example Anderson stated generally diagram pictorial yet abstract representation information example diagram whereas photograph video
On hand Lowe defined diagram specifically abstract graphic portrayal subject matter represent
In specific sense diagram chart contrast technical illustration map showing abstract rather representation information
The essence diagram seen Or Hall word diagram simplified figure caricature way intended convey essential meaning
These simplified figure often based set rule
The basic shape according White characterized term elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity validity
Elegance basically determined whether diagram simplest fitting solution problem
There least following type diagram type diagram Many type diagram commonly generated using diagramming software
Thousands diagram technique exist
Some example follow
Diagrams may also classified according use purpose example explanatory diagram

Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph
In note look
They include

A graphical representation
A circuit diagram us simple image component show component interconnection circuit using standardized symbolic representation
The presentation interconnection circuit component schematic diagram necessarily correspond physical arrangement finished device
Unlike circuit diagram show actual
A drawing meant depict physical arrangement wire component connect called
Circuit diagram used design construction layout maintenance electrical electronic equipment
In circuit diagram useful visualizing expression using
Circuit diagram picture symbol differed country country changed time large extent internationally standardized
Simple component often symbol intended represent feature physical construction device
For example symbol resistor shown date back day component made long piece wire wrapped manner produce inductance would made
These wirewound resistor used application smaller resistor cast mixture fabricated insulating tube chip coated metal film
The internationally standardized symbol resistor therefore simplified oblong sometimes value written inside instead symbol
A le common symbol simply series peak one side line representing conductor rather shown
The linkage lead simple crossing line
With arrival computerized drafting connection two intersecting wire shown crossing wire dot blob indicate connection
At time crossover simplified crossing without dot
However danger confusing wire connected connected manner dot drawn small accidentally omitted
dot could disappear several pass copy machine
As modern practice representing wire connection draw straight wire draw wire staggered along dot connection see diagram form two separate brook confusion clearly crossover
For crossing wire insulated one another small symbol commonly used show one wire jumping wire similar jumper wire used
A common hybrid style drawing combine crossover dot connection wire jump symbol insulated crossing
In manner dot small see accidentally disappeared still clearly differentiated jump
On circuit diagram component labelled descriptor matching list part
For example first first first first
Often value type designation component given diagram beside part detailed specification would go part list
Detailed rule reference designation provided International standard
It usual although universal convention schematic drawing organized page left right top bottom sequence flow main signal power path
For example schematic radio receiver might start antenna input left page end loudspeaker right
Positive power supply connection stage would shown towards top page ground negative supply return path towards bottom
Schematic drawing intended maintenance may principal signal path highlighted assist understanding signal flow circuit
More complex device schematic must rely symbol show flow signal different sheet drawing
Detailed rule preparation circuit diagram document type used electrotechnology provided international standard
line diagram also called diagram use another common standardized convention organizing schematic drawing vertical power supply rail left another right component strung like rung ladder
Once schematic made converted layout fabricated onto printed circuit board PCB
start process
The result known rat nest
The rat nest jumble wire line destination node
These wire routed either manually automatically use electronics design automation EDA tool
The EDA tool arrange rearrange placement component find path track connect various node
This result final artwork
A generalized design flow may follows

A prototype generally used evaluate new design enhance precision system analyst user
Prototyping serf provide specification real working system rather theoretical one
In design workflow model creating prototype process sometimes called step idea
The word derives πρωτότυπον primitive form neutral πρωτότυπος original primitive πρῶτος first τύπος impression
Prototypes explore different aspect intended design In general creation prototype differ creation final product fundamental way Engineers prototype specialist attempt minimize impact difference intended role prototype
For example visual prototype able use material final product attempt substitute material property closely simulate intended final material
Engineers prototyping specialist seek understand limitation prototype exactly simulate characteristic intended design
It important realize definition prototype represent compromise final production design
Due difference material process design fidelity possible prototype may fail perform acceptably whereas production design may sound
A idea prototype may actually perform acceptably whereas production design may flawed since prototyping material process may occasionally outperform production counterpart
In general expected individual prototype cost substantially greater final production cost due inefficiency material process
Prototypes also used revise design purpose reducing cost optimization refinement
It possible use prototype testing reduce risk design may perform intended however prototype generally eliminate risk
There pragmatic practical limitation ability prototype match intended final performance product allowance engineering judgement often required moving forward production design
Building full design often expensive especially repeated several full design figuring problem solve building another full design
As alternative technique used initial prototype implement part complete design
This allows designer manufacturer rapidly inexpensively test part design likely problem solve problem build full design

tool like exist document electronic prototype especially one move toward physical production
Prototyping platform also simplify task programming interacting
The developer choose deploy invention using prototyping platform replace microcontroller chip circuitry relevant product
A technician quickly build prototype make addition modification using technique volume production much faster usually cheaper custom produce kind prototype board
The proliferation PCB fabrication assembly company enabled concept rapid prototyping applied electronic circuit design
It possible even smallest passive component largest package board fabricated assembled even tested matter day
In many function confused software prototyping
This term rather term notion
In form new object produced cloning existing object called prototype
The term may also refer
Additionally term may refer design pattern
Prototype software often referred alpha grade meaning first version run
Often function implemented primary focus alpha functional base code feature may added
Once alpha grade software required feature integrated becomes beta software testing entire software adjust program respond correctly situation unforeseen development
Often end user may able provide complete set application objective detailed input processing output requirement initial stage
After user evaluation another prototype built based feedback user cycle return customer evaluation
The cycle start listening user followed building revising letting user test back
There new generation tool called help quickly simulate application development
us gradually add one feature time initial prototype

As basic rapid prototype machine cost larger precise machine cost much
In science practice object used standard base measurement physical quantity
Sometimes standard object called
In prototype remaining current use solid cylinder kept International Bureau Weights Measures suburb mass exactly one
Copies prototype fashioned issued many nation represent national standard kilogram periodically compared Paris prototype
Until defined prototype bar two scratch mark definition spaced apart one meter meter redefined distance covered thus speed light meter per second
It widely believed kilogram prototype standard replaced
There two likely replacement
One definition kilogram define another likely either defined numerical value thus obviating need prototype removing possibility prototype thus standard definition kilogram changing slightly year loss gain atom

The prototype pattern used type object create determined prototypical instance cloned produce new object
This pattern used To implement pattern declare abstract base class specifies pure virtual method
Any class need polymorphic constructor capability derives abstract base class implement operation
The client instead writing code invokes new operator class name call method prototype call factory method parameter designating particular concrete derived class desired invokes method mechanism provided another design pattern
Sometimes creational pattern overlap case either Prototype Abstract Factory would appropriate
At time complement Abstract Factory might store set Prototypes clone return product object GoF
Abstract Factory Builder Prototype use Singleton implementation
GoF
Abstract Factory class often implemented Factory Methods creation inheritance implemented using Prototype creation delegation
GoF Often design start using Factory Method le complicated customizable subclass proliferate evolve toward Abstract Factory Prototype Builder flexible complex designer discovers flexibility needed
GoF Prototype require subclassing require initialize operation
Factory Method requires subclassing require initialization
GoF Designs make heavy use Composite Decorator pattern often benefit Prototype well
GoF The rule thumb could would need clone want create another Object Object cloning
mean attribute newly created Object Object cloning
If could class using instead would get Object attribute initial value
For example designing system performing bank account transaction would want make copy Object hold account information perform transaction replace original Object modified one
In case would want use clone instead new
It specifies kind object create using prototypical instance
Prototypes new product often built prior full production example prototype passive participate copying
The mitotic division cell resulting two identical cell example prototype play active role copying thus demonstrates Prototype pattern
When cell split two cell identical genotype result
In word cell clone

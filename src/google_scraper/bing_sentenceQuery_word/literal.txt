In contrast literal symbol take one class fixed value constant constrained change
Literals often used initialize variable example following integer literal three letter string cat string literal In literal given type generally token type grammar rule like integer literal
Some literal specific like boolean literal true
In language like object also represented literal
Methods object specified object literal using
The brace notation also used array literal typical object literal In well derivative object method written using object literal like These object literal similar language like

What word literal mean used context literal string literal value
What difference literal value value
A literal notation value within source code Contrast value memory
Examples Some thing literal A literal value directly source
For example Some literal special syntax know type literal What set apart variable resource compiler treat constant perform certain optimization code used certain wo change
A literal assignment explicit value EDIT As pointed assignment nothing definition literal I using assignment example literal also passed method etc
In programming value written exactly meant interpreted
In contrast variable name represent different value execution program
And constant name represents value throughout program
But literal name value
A literal number character string
For example expression x x variable literal
A literal include value source code opposed referencing variable constant
For example If literal represents quantity like physical constant better give name instead writing literal everywhere need
That way reading source code know number usually important value could change anyways
Generally numeric literal I use besides initialize constant like sometimes I skipping every item loop
If number important actual usually better name
A literal value value value could also stored variable
In statement string variable str string literal
After statement executed value
Be aware many language variable literal value necessarily even type
For example The literal value floating point type
The value coerced compiler fit int variable
For another example first line code type string literal actually library type
To maintain backwards compatibility C string literal char array
Quick example int This set character refers integer value
This set character refers integer value
A literal put code
So string literal This opposed building string taking parameter
Generally someone us word literal mean value decipherable code text shown many example post
Another common usage value converted immediate value assembly
These value inserted directly machine instruction rather requiring register load
I heard string literal used casually refer actually refers verbatim string literal
A regular string literal allows escaping certain character prefixed like tab
A verbatim string literal prepended processed verbatim special meaning
A literal source code representation data

Propositional logic good vehicle introduce basic property logic
It provide mean determine validity truth false atomic statement
Instead allows evaluate validity compound statement given validity atomic component
For example consider following Accept fact first two statement noting use exclusive thus could really thought saying I like Pat I like Joe I like
Do statement imply I like Joe true
Try convince I like Joe true consider another line reasoning We see answer case
The two set statement abstracted follows Here concerned logical reasoning statement
Thus instead working pig Pats simply write We begin study first syntax propositional logic describe element language logic written
We describe semantics symbol symbol mean
The syntax propositional logic composed propositional symbol logical connective parenthesis
Rules govern element written together
First treat propositional symbol merely set symbol purpose use letter Roman Greek alphabet refer set symbol Second logical connective Note minimal required set equivalently represented using single connective NOR NAND used lowest level computer hardware
Finally use parenthesis denote expression later make parenthesis optional An string propositional symbol parenthesis logical connective
The expression consider called
The set formula smallest set expression Another way define formula language defined following grammar start symbol The context free grammar unambiguous
The function formula create meaning statement given meaning atomic statement
The semantics formula propositional symbol mapping associating truth assignment truth value
The truth value used instead respectively well abbreviation
The semantics well defined due Fact seen
One way specify semantics logical connective via truth table Can one always find formula implement given semantics
Yes truth table realized formula
The formula found follows
Represent row conjunction true proposition symbol negation false one
Finally write disjunction result
For example Every formula equivalent disjunction conjunction propositional symbol negation propositional symbol
Dual DNF
To get CNF There case DNF resp
CNF exponentially larger original formula
For example equivalent DNF exponential size
Does truth table polynomial size formula implementing
More precisely exist every truth table propositional symbol form size
Answer
Assume exists
The number truth table propositional symbol
The number formula size propositional symbol connective parenthesis
Clearly sufficiently large
TODO exposition explain definition provide context Note



It also possible prove directly
Special case SAT polynomial time
Example A disjunction literal one positive
There two kind possible Horn clause For every set Horn formula checking whether satisfiable
Let subset containing clause type subset containing clause type
Note first satisfiable
To obtain minimum satisfying assignment start literal clause crank rule
It remains check consistency clause
To enough check clause true
Consider set Horn clause The set clause type consists first clause consists last clause
Note also written The minimum satisfying assignment obtained follows Thus minimum satisfying assignment make true
This contradicts state must false
Thus satisfiable
A system mechanism proving new statement given statement
Let set known valid statement propositional formula
In deductive system two component inference rule proof
If proof using inference rule write
Natural deduction collection inference rule
Let denote contradiction falsity
The following inference rule natural deduction Rule allows u prove valid statement form If even know truth value statement set known valid statement
Indeed rule start assuming valid
If conclude valid world valid conclude relation true release assumption valid
We show apply inference rule
Example De Morgan Law negated say By rule prove infer desired result
To prove first direction use rule assume hypothesis
Then We prove second direction
Proof Pierce Law Natural deduction sound
To show natural deduction also complete need introduce propositional resolution
Resolution another procedure checking validity statement
It involves single rule
Some terminology A proof system resolution contains single resolution rule resolvent defined follows
Assume clause The smallest set clause containing closed resolution denoted
If
It possible show resolution rule defined computes clause inferred using natural deduction
Let two clause
Then
In order prove validity statement prove statement unsatisfiable
To prove unsatisfiability formula need define formula The resolution refutation tree formula tree rooted empty clause every leaf clause internal node computed resolvent two corresponding child
Notice clause appear repeated leaf
From claim conclude If exists resolution refutation tree formula unsatisfiable
The formula following resolution refutation tree The order clause selected compute resolvent matter computing resolution refutation tree following example show Consider formula Even though resolution refutation tree may exist order important trying build tree
Below two different resolution refutation tree one successful Propositional resolution sound exists resolution refutation tree given formula must unsatisfiable
For formula
Propositional resolution complete given formula unsatisfiable resolution refutation tree
For formula
By induction number variable
We one variable say
All possible clause
If unsatisfiable clause occur therefore
Suppose hypothesis true formula le variable
Let formula variable
Suppose show satisfiable
Let variable
Then either hold immediately
Assume
We define formula containing clause contain literal removed clause word equivalent formula resulting setting true
Formally First notice thus Also since
By induction hypothesis satisfiable
Then satisfiable extension satisfying assignment equal true
The case analogous
Let set inference rule Natural Deduction
If
The idea behind proof completeness natural deduction follows
Suppose valid unsatisfiable
We show exists resolution refutation applying contradiction rule rule conclude inferred
Sketch Given formula valid perform following step Step easily done repeated application De Morgan law
Step proven using natural deduction
Finally step proven induction number step obtain
Clearly step simulated using natural deduction
It likely algorithm propositional resolution take long worst case recall checking validity formula complete
Linear resolution particular resolution strategy always resolve recent resolvent clause
The resolution refutation tree obtained therefore linear
It possible prove set clause Horn clause exists linear resolution strategy formula
That linear resolution complete set Horn clause
The language PROLOG us resolution set Horn clause
Each clause called
Moreover clause composed single literal called
A clause single negated literal called
The table show comparison different notation
In PROLOG query statement idea negate statement perform resolution set known true statement
If resolution refutation tree found statement implied program
An example linear resolution formula shown

This paper cover history use literal constant programming language beginning programming present day
Literals many programming language discussed including modern language C Java scripting language older language COBOL FORTRAN
Design issue type literal problem literal illustrated
Literals vary across language much programmer would expect
Copyright Dennie Van Tassel
Please send suggestion comment Literals constant value write conventional form whose value obvious
In contrast variable literal hi change value
These also called
I also seen called pure constant I sure terminology agreed
At first glance one may think programming language type literal way
While lot common convention different language interesting difference
Typical integer Typical real Typical scientific Integer Typical Hexadecimal literal Typical character Typical character string Old FORTRAN string Special literal Literals represent possible choice primitive type language
Some choice type literal often integer floating point Booleans character string
Each discussed chapter
Integers commonly described number decimal point exponent
Another description integer literal string decimal digit without decimal point
Thus following valid integer language Integers may may sign must fall within restricted range
Negative value need preceded minus sign
If integer use bit maximum value would since need use one bit negative number
There two integer constant available language Early C allow since integer without sign positive default unary positive sign used
Thus C unary negative operator unary positive operator
But many later C compiler Java allow unneeded positive sign constant
Few language actually forbid unary positive sign
The last constant would evaluate would floating point value C FORTRAN
Their rule floating point constant decimal point OR exponent
Thus would floating point
But integer exponent integer
Negative exponent allowed integer
Thus error constant
There design issue integer
They There yes answer question language different language different answer
Most language one default size integer available
On word size machine integer range
On word size machine integer range
Today integer common
Unfortunately computer integer useful comma mark thousand
But simplification since hexadecimal integer use letter
And may want octal value way indicate desired size integer
Also definition integer previous paragraph true language
For example Ada integer real literal exponent
Thus integer literal could also written But many language exponent would indicate floating point literal
For integer exponent must positive
Ada allows u use underscore improve readability
The underscore often used separate number group three digit like comma used area
Here example In number underscore placed comma would normally underscore placed convenient place
Perl Ruby also allow underscore integer
If one size integer need way indicate precision integer constant
The C family us L l ell integer indicate long integer
Thus used long integer
We use lower case l tell difference L one always use upper case These suffix useful force arithmetic particular precision
Besides long integer unsigned integer C use suffix u U
Thus could write get unsigned integer fifteen
Long unsigned integer indicated terminating UL get unsigned long integer
For regular integer one bit must saved store sign integer
If variable constant unsigned bit used integer
Thus signed integer may unsigned integer stored amount storage go
If language long integer use
For example write want end integer overflow truncation
A good compiler would automatically store integer long integer may want help u
In language long integer restricted large size
Python us L indicate long integer like Python long integer arbitrarily big
arbitrarily long integer These form BASIC two type integer
The two type integer
Early BASIC type number
There distinction integer floating point
But several numeric type
For numeric constant suffix used number indicate type
Here use Integer Long integer Single precision none
Double precision Types BASIC Thus integer
floating point precision float
By default number real floating point precision
If want precision float type
VB broken BASIC parent changed character append numeric literal
Whole number decimal point type number decimal point type
Otherwise use method similar previous dialect BASIC use different code change default type
VB code follows S integer I L integer F floating point R floating point D So three type integer two type floating point
They use decimal fraction dollar cent
Thus integer integer
And floating point literal floating point literal
Finally literal
The range value VB much larger previous language
For example range
C similar type value range
Sometimes want different base radix constant besides base
Base base useful storage address
The C family allows u indicate octal constant preceding number zero
So octal decimal twelve
For octal value range digit
So putting together learned previous section use terminating L make constant Long U make unsigned
Thus unsigned long octal value equivalent decimal value
For hexadecimal value need precede number
Thus hexadecimal decimal
Now range acceptable digit A B E We use upper lower case letter Again use long integer indicator L
Thus long octal seven long hexadecimal seven
We also use terminating U make unsigned
Thus unsigned long hexadecimal value F equivalent decimal value
Ruby octal hexadecimal literal C Ruby added binary number
So Ruby hexadecimal value like octal value like binary value like
FORTRAN little differently
They allow radix number base
They start value letter B binary radix letter O oh octal letter Z hexadecimal
Then number follows string digit enclosed double single quote
The range digit must acceptable desired base
The integer value would base two base eight base
I try hard chauvinistic I sure like C method better case
This FORTRAN solution illustrates problem adding feature existing language
They decide use C solution number starting zero octal value
Millions old FORTRAN program would longer work correctly compiled new FORTRAN compiler since would octal instead decimal
On positive side change thousand old FORTRAN programmer would suddenly employment
language always little C FORTRAN added base us different syntax
An integer expressed base prefixing number base bracketing number within symbol
Thus decimal value expressed various base follows While kind interesting I see much use base obviously someone
In addition C FORTRAN use octal hexadecimal constant allows floating point constant different base
Thus could expressed base another base
Suppose wanted add base Java
Presently language handle decimal octal hexadecimal
The people designed method beginning FORTRAN add existing language
Try figure could add base Java without breaking million old program
number decimal point thus real literal
Real number called float floating point language
Another description number decimal point exponent thus would real literal using definition
Like integer literal positive negative sign precede number comma allowed
Thus real literal If language accepts lower upper case e exponent lower case upper case
It may vary language acceptable may need decimal point
The e stand exponent mean multiply value follows
Thus Scientific notation useful expressing small number large value chance win lottery national debt
There design issue floating point constant
Here There interesting answer question language different language different answer
Early chapter discussed integer literal noted integer literal also exponent
So Ada real literal must decimal point
Another rule real literal must digit side decimal point
Thus
legal real literal acceptable
COBOL similar different restriction floating point literal
In COBOL literal OK OK must changed since period terminates statement followed space
In Pascal legal since need digit decimal point
The C family three type
And allow u indicate type real literal
Real constant stored default
If want stored instead add f F constant like
If want stored use l lower case L L like integer
Thus would last one look lot like three point forty one instead
All suffix useful control amount storage used precision result
For example need constant otherwise arithmetic would done higher type double
For long precision one constant would force arithmetic use long double
This explained section Coercion Arithmetic chapter
In FORTRAN default type single precision like float C
We may type single precision real may want stored double precision real
FORTRAN us suffix D indicate double precision
Thus write indicate double precision real value
This easy way force arithmetic double precision
For example x get u double precision division double precision
FORTRAN IV complex number
Data complex type represented two number parenthesis separated comma
The number left comma real part number right comma represents imaginary part complex number
Thus complex constant assigned complex variable follows Fortran necessary operation function handle complex value
It interesting early computing history complex value handled Ruby us similar syntax complex constant
In Python complex number composed two number real part imaginary part coded adding J j imaginary part
Thus write complex number
A language built complex number necessary arithmetic operator function
When talk single double precision integer need figure doubled
Integers easiest understand since worry exponent decimal point
The smallest integer stored one byte bit one bit sign
Thus room positive negative sign bit give u range
The next size integer may use two byte allow range
Finally next largest integer would
As seen largest smallest number integer type language machine dependent
But fairly true across many language
language integer size The situation get much machine language dependent floating point value
For two part besides sign exponent mantissa
Thus mantissa exponent
The mantissa commonly place smallest float place next largest float finally place largest float
Not language three size
Early language one size
Newer language tend three size especially language used scientific programming
There two way available program get precision integer value
The way covered far common programmer get language hardware give u
For example smaller value place accuracy larger floating point value place accuracy
These default based size word hardware
This loss control mostly accepted without question
But expand variety machine available size machine default change
So FORTRAN mean u programmer select exact precision needed
FORTRAN method similar C mark precision real number FORTRAN method powerful flexible
But first need discus need FORTRAN variation default number precision
FORTRAN around decade available small computer large computer
A real number might seven significant digit number might place many computer
But small computer may range large super computer may twice range
So FORTRAN program written one computer mean needed indicate needed precision program taken new computer
So FORTRAN provides used indicate kind precision needed real integer value
For real number least two default kind number integer value kind number
For real number use kind number indicate single significant digit kind number indicate double significant digit
Some FORTRAN compiler may larger significant digit another kind number
To specify kind constant underscore followed kind number appended constant
Thus single precision kind double precision kind
Notice underscore FORTRAN different meaning Perl
Integer value kind value range kind value range kind maybe kind
Thus integer kind number
If kind value supported compiler generates syntax error compiling program
There great deal FORTRAN
We use operator two colon indicate exact minimum precision needed integer real value
Named constant used kind value
Here couple brief example First need set kind indicator
In two line used indicate integer kind range digit indicates real number least significant digit exponent range
Now use like kind constant
This brief description FORTRAN kind number
If want information need find FORTRAN textbook
These kind number also available variable
Your PhD thesis indicate expand Java language indicate desired precision constant variable
Read previous section FORTRAN kind number
If method break previous program obtain PhD
early BASIC distinguish integer float
These two language number
Do think good approach
Should OPL
Why
We seen several type numeric literal constant
What numeric constant think OPL
Do want allow different integer literal
For example short long integer
Do need one two three type integer
And shall indicate desired type integer
Do want allow different real literal
For example float double long double
Do need one two three type real literal
How shall write different form OPL
What base radix integer allow binary octal hexadecimal others
The C family one way FORTRAN another way third method
And shall write different number OPL
Most language allow comma numeric literal like
Is restriction still necessary
Do think allow comma number OPL
Notice handle
We need want literal true false
These called Booleans depending language
Some language reserved keyword value
Booleans ordinal value usually le
The normal operation
There decision difference Boolean value
Here question All version FORTRAN use logical constant
And FORTRAN called instead Booleans
Since FORTRAN reserved word FORTRAN us period logical literal differentiate variable
If print FORTRAN Boolean variable print either T F need input reading Boolean data program
Pascal ALGOL Java use Boolean literal
The inputting outputting logical value messy language
If want use integer use exactly way literal constant program read integer print integer
It simple logical literal
Some language nice way input output Boolean value
For example FORTRAN print F But want read value true use letter period period word true string start letter period letter anything
So input output inside program potentially different FORTRAN
The C family language use named constant logical value
Instead use zero false one true result relational logical expression
Thus tried print would get zero would get u
Character string next type literal
A character string group character glued together
An example famous Hello world
But thing start easily
In fact little availability type character use early computer
FORTRAN introduced string named Herman invented punched card equipment Bureau Census
Now would use follows HELLO WORLD
The indicates thirteen character follow
These used output format statement
Thus could something like following There character variable way manipulate character string
There design issue character string constant
They Thus sequence symbol enclosed matched single double quote
Character string also called string character constant literal
Each character us one byte storage
One interesting consideration delimit string indicate start end string
Next need know use delimiter inside string
For example use quote enclose string put quote string
Also string extend one line restricted one line
Finally need string operator function search compare construct string
There almost many way concatenate character string language group
Quotations mark apostrophe common delimiter demarcating mark character string
Quotation mark often called double quote apostrophe often called single quote
Some language Java C use quotation mark
Other language Pascal FORTRAN use apostrophe
And still language HTML xxx allow either quotation apostrophe long used particular string
Thus use Hello world
quotation Hello apostrophe use Hello World quotation mark start apostrophe end
I know language allows I watch someone know one
If use quote single double enclose string need way insert quote inside string without upsetting character string
An used void special meaning next character
There two common solution problem
One solution use two character quote indicate one
Another method use escape character protect quote
FORTRAN us apostrophe string us first solution
So FORTRAN want DON T DO IT would something similar modifies DON T DON T processing
COBOL Pascal BASIC use
The repetition enclosed quote sometimes called
unusual since require quote stuffing escape character protect quotation character single character
character literal enclosed within single quote character enclosed including single quote
Thus fine also fine
Most language would require protect enclosed single quote
If think seems quite feasible way language seem way
Java C use escape character
The backslash used escape special meaning next character
Thus could print similar phrase follows Here quote mark inside character string using quotation mark
This use escape character allows u enclose character would normally cause problem inside character string new line
And escape character followed hexadecimal octal value generate character even character
C language UNIX program use last method extensively
Table includes list escape character work C family language UNIX program
C mostly us escape character BEL Backspace BS Form feed FF New line LF Carriage return CR Horizontal tab TAB Vertical tab VT double quote single quote backslash Octal character Hexadecimal character Enter key continuation HTML XML use angle bracket command
Then need way insert angle bracket
XML us character reference start symbol end semicolon
Then necessary
Thus get using either stand es han character reference number
Not get character otherwise would cause problem get character language keyboard
A third partial solution need quote inside character string allow either type quotation
This method used version BASIC SQL COBOL HTML
This allows u following apostrophe inside quotation mark quotation mark inside apostrophe We still problem really need want quote mark inside quoted string one two method used
Such Use quote
From previous discussion see level activity within character string varies language
At lowest level problem using quotation delimiter inside character string
Two method used either
As move along mostly activity inside string find language long short list escape character like table variable interpretation UNIX language friend
These latter character string I label since lot activity happen within character string
Both Perl UNIX shell programming language handle character string important difference language
Strings delimited either matching quotation mark apostrophe
When character string enclosed apostrophe character treated literal
When character string enclosed quotation mark character treated literal exception variable substitution special escape sequence
For example Perl variable interpreted So Perl variable interpreted enclosed double quote interpreted enclosed single quote
Likewise escape sequence processed within quotation mark apostrophe There many named control character character processed decimal octal hexadecimal value
See xxx zzzz
If UNIX method quoting prove inadequate messy Perl provides alternate form quoting follows The string quoted need enclosed matching delimiters
We use forward slash matching character could used The dollar sign special symbol Perl need quoted single quote
Any character used quote
The example used slash character used
Perl added little magic
If opening quote character opening bracket angle square curly round closing quote next matching bracket nest get converted leaving internal alone
This remove possibility dangling bracket problem
And remember saw first dangling bracket book
Besides escape sequence used C UNIX Perl additional escape sequence
Here Perl escape sequence Control character Next character converted lower case
Next character converted upper case
Next character converted lower case found
Next character converted upper case found
These escape sequence come useful character matching Perl used lot
UNIX Perl us indicate command execute
The output assigned variable used output statement
FIND WHAT
This method work variety UNIX shell command
Many language special literal
Examples C COBOL Perl
These special literal discussed Named Constant section Variables chapter
Character string literal use escape sequence useful file address inserting special character line feed tab messy situation
For example would normally something similar point great picture
But need escape backslashes
With C avoid double backslashes follows Verbatim string literal start character followed character string
In verbatim string literal character delimiters interpreted verbatim exception
If need quotation mark verbatim string literal need familiar doubled quotation mark
Most quotation method used requires exception
Python two new type string
First string everything matching group three single double quote included including quote line return
This similar Perl method
This easy way In example quote allowed retained
The backslash character used escape character otherwise special meaning backslash quote character
Either triple double triple single quote used
The second Python string type raw string
These string start r R use different rule processing escape sequence
Backslashes left string
Thus get stored character
Otherwise C family language process escape sequence tab character string
There situation Web address regular expression want escape sequence interpolated
For example get processed since turned new line
Raw string prevent
We change The r apostrophe indicates raw sting
If interested character string handled Python one language look
UNIX PHP Perl document similar Python raw string
The name document come fact document right
We could previous Python example Perl follows A language date literal
The first problem type date recognized date
Visual Basic us sign enclose date follows A date literal used assignment statement much like literal C date variable always assume time even given one value stored would VB provides wide variety function manipulating date adding interval date subtracting two date formatting date output
If interesting operation done date might look VB look application spreadsheet database program see possible
Several language special literal initializing array
These briefly covered covered detail Array Chapter
Perl list literal used array
Examples Perl lot available skip Array chapter interested
FORTRAN also extensive array method
When comparing character string constitutes equality interest
The main question extra blank right side comparison
If compare string hi hi equal
There space first hi blank space second string
In QBASIC two string expression considered equal contain identical sequence character
In COBOL string equal character equal longer field blank space right
Thus COBOL purpose comparison blank space padded right side shorter field
So QBasic character string Hi Hi would COBOL would evaluated
We may able find pattern business programming language ignore extra blank space language
Some language operator repeat string constant
For example following method get city probably type lot
Quick name city identical word
This repetition could used assign value character string follows Perl us x operator repeat string Python Ruby use operator repeat string
If wanted generate string could follows Few language besides language way
But I suspect someone another language I missed
I went literal many language chapter
At simplest level literal similar many language look detail find lot interesting difference
Some language allow underscore number like comma used indicate thousand million
And get character string lot difference
Quoting interpreting character string varies lot especially scripting language
And several way handle long character string special character including newlines
What method think use OPL use string delimiter within character string
Two present method presented doubling quote escape sequence
Perl UNIX shell interesting quoting mechanism
Variables escape sequence evaluating inside double quote single quote
Can use OPL
Would feature interesting language others business scientific system language
Perl UNIX shell interesting way execute system command back quote
Can use OPL
Would feature interesting language others business language scientific language system language
Are value ordered
If
Python triple quote character string
This character string start three quote single double anything inside character string including new line quote
Look compare method Perl
Do think method would good additional OPL
Each language different way indicate octal hexadecimal constant
Develop chart language indicating language
What method recommend OPL

Send comment suggestion I especially interested error omission I chapter History Programming Languages
Notice integer value negative exponent evaluate integer
For example changed integer becomes zero
Hint
Search Web word oddity

In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order
See alternative string ordering preserve
A number additional operation string commonly occur formal theory
These given article
Strings admit following interpretation node graph The natural topology set string string discrete topology natural topology set infinite string viewing set infinite string set finite string
This construction used construction yield topology
string representation topology found normalizing according
A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero
See also
String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function

The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated

Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent

New graduate student engineering computer science come variety background
Those entering graduate school immediately achieving undergraduate degree may experience finding kind book paper needed undergraduate liberal art class may little exposure literature need graduate program
Students returning school year workplace may know standard trade resource used engineering work may comfortable conference paper journal article
Over time graduate student achieve degree fluency literature need research
Engineering librarian decrease time fluency building knowledge past student cited research sharing knowledge student
At time increase credibility engineering faculty administration position informed collection development
As liaison librarian Aerospace Engineering Mechanics AEM Electrical Computer Engineering ECE Computer Science Engineering CS I began project mean determining new graduate student needed know literature field order provide effective instruction user service
I analyzed citation bibliography dissertation thesis three department published period
The result show difference type discipline age material used graduate student researcher department
The University Minnesota public research university enrolled student
The University College Science Engineering includes academic department enrolled undergraduate graduate student
Table list number faculty member undergraduate graduate student department included study
A small percentage student seek individual librarian consultation program liaison librarian must find creative way become familiar different type research occurring department kind literature researcher student level need
By reviewing bibliography dissertation thesis completed recent past author sought answer research question Citation analysis process gathering citation set source document separating component part aggregating part highlight trend material type journal title age factor
Many librarian undertake citation analysis local level way evaluating past collection development practice informing future decision regarding collection

They found composite list quite different individual list
While bolstering contention local citation analysis necessary understand practice local researcher finding demonstrates citation analysis study necessarily generalized
The study also revealed institution collection included vast majority citation author institution
The author argue finding may easily indicate researcher local collection indicates quality collection
Even stated objective citation analysis study inform collection development effort often result improvement user service
Kirkwood able demonstrate need fund purchase monographic material civil engineering student also found training experience graduate assistant gained collecting data made effective reference desk
In addition process brought light tool skill new graduate student taught
Knowing type age range literature used researcher discipline key understanding cultural norm discipline

Data element collected source document included title date submitted department advisor author
Data element collected citation included text citation literature type publication year journal conference title applicable
Table show number citation well average department
In order provide rich picture literature use possible citation assigned one literature type
For analysis type aggregated seven summary literature type Literature type determined using UlrichsWeb title found searching Google Scholar article title inspecting article required information
UlrichsWeb OCLC WorldCat provided ISSN publisher Library Congress classification journal
Overall graduate student three department cited article academic journal often anything else shown Table
Books accounted percent citation
This consistent Musser Conkling analysis citation engineering journal In work journal comprised percent citation monograph accounted percent
By contrast although Miller analysis biology thesis showed similar use book percent student study referenced journal article percent time conference paper scant percent
Kayongo Helm noted dissertation writer art humanity Notre Dame cited book percent time percent social science scholar citation book
Although journal article conference paper cited much often book engineering computer science analysis data showed marked difference among three department Figure
Computer scientist likely cite conference paper percent literature type including journal article percent
Unlike academic discipline conference publication computer science considered least par superior journal publication
Aerospace Engineering student likely use report Computer Science Electrical Engineering
Although citation exceptionally high relative literature type percent citing report common Of source document Aerospace Engineering cited least one report
Reports commonly AIAA Papers report
During data gathering phase became apparent computer scientist cited literature discipline student two department
Therefore Library Congress classification journal cited collected analyzed
Figure illustrates relatively large number citation journal outside Science Technology computer science student
Note Computer Science classified Library Congress Science within Mathematics subclass
This account high number citation journal classified Mathematics relative science shown Table
Journals cited Physiology largely Natural bioinformatics molecular biology
Computer Science scholar also drew material discipline outside Science Technology Table
About percent social science journal cited related statistic
As Physiology Natural journal Science classification journal classified Medicine mostly related neuroscience bioinformatics molecular biology
Philosophy Psychology Religion journal fell entirely Psychology subclass including cognitive science
Language Literature title related linguistics
Aerospace Engineering journal cited predominantly Science classification
This surprising since subclass Aeronautics Astronautics TL Technology classification
Journals Science classification fell Mathematics Physics subclass
The highly cited journal area Journal Fluid Mechanics Physics Fluids Experiments Fluids
The University Aerospace Engineering Mechanics department strong Fluid Mechanics research area worth noting citation three journal came seven source document two dissertation accounting Table
As literature type journal classification age profile material used differs department
The average Computer Science Electrical Engineering shown Table similar average age Aerospace Engineering literature substantially older type listed
This imply Aerospace Engineering student cited older literature percent conference paper journal article cited six year four year old respectively
Those age similar percent mark Computer Science Electrical Engineering citation
But aerospace engineering material appear longer shelf life
percent journal article cited year old
Aerospace Engineering student use older literature bear examination particularly relates report
As noted Thompson NASA precursor NACA conducted great deal basic research area surrounding flight space travel
Reports research still valuable field today
Citation count spike year mark year mark
The first includes NACA work wing airfoil section
The second set citation includes research boundary layer heat transfer would particularly important spacecraft launch reentry
Because Master PhD student use cite material outside LC subclass discipline therefore outside scope discipline author examined average age journal subclass dissertation writer discipline compared overall average age journal discipline
The data subclass scattered particularly since many subclass one two associated citation
Table show selection subclass discipline comparison
As assumed outset study graduate student engineering computer science overall cited academic journal article often type literature
However true discipline Computer Science student cited conference paper frequently journal article
Conference paper generally considered grey literature increasingly findable web conference web site sponsoring society database institutional repository
It may Fortnow suggests computer science researcher join rest academy move toward polished journal article standard citation
But time seems likely field electrical engineering increasingly accept conference paper mode sharing new research place le emphasis journal article
More longitudinal research across different type publication needed determine whether trend exists
In light future need journal article conference paper engineering computer science graduate student taught search literature licensed database well Google Scholar society publisher web site
They understand search tool provide efficient path particular literature need find either particular item citation everything topic
All liaison collection responsibility spend selection time book
Selectors engineering computer science aware spend time managing serial collection book study indicates time allocation appropriate
The data study help explain others library system engineering selector need process differ many colleague
In addition highlighting heavy use journal article conference paper across engineering discipline studied data show importance report aerospace engineering student
Many NACA NASA AIAA report commonly used aerospace engineering available online
But many available University Minnesota microfiche form
Liaisons help introduce student culture literature field offering instruction find use paper digitized
The wide range literature cited particularly computer science support Tucci assertion interdisciplinary work may well present librarian excellent opportunity convince faculty member practicing librarian critical knowledge skill help improve efficiency effectiveness research
Clearly librarian working within liaison subject specialist model must make point learning educating colleague wide range discipline outside subject area
Liaisons instructing new graduate student need school use literature every possibly overlapping field gain knowledge
But make student aware difference well database exist librarian available within institution help connect interdisciplinary information need
Because budget cut new material may relevant beyond strict department boundary selector need make faculty aware decision collection particularly journal subscription subject area
The data imply conclude age profile useful literature field may differ age profile literature used within student discipline
For example possible computer scientist working biology research would need older biology review article scholar working full time biology
More study needed determine whether scholar particular field use literature way outside field use
Although analysis discussed portrays certain profile use department studied profile interpreted complete model research discipline either general University Minnesota
Aspects data particularly relates interdisciplinary research may reflect research grant activity lab happened produce higher number dissertation thesis timeframe covered
It important understand area use literature discipline others le important know discipline University Minnesota timeframe
Conducting study deepened knowledge subject area
But importantly study result changed way I orient new graduate student finding literature field
I present finding fall orientation session department new student notably type literature used field diversity subject area used computer science use older report aerospace engineering
The final result provide snapshot help new student understand need know begin information gathering process demonstrate engineering different discipline differ one another
At time citation analysis thesis dissertation one tool understanding literature used field
Some writer source document continue academia produce writing likely draw type literature
But vast majority Master recipient half doctoral engineer computer scientist work private sector
A study Jeffryes Lafferty used survey focus group made University Minnesota undergraduate participated cooperative education program
Their summary type literature student asked use job comfort level finding using literature provides second perspective student taught engineering resource prepare workplace
For example research showed three quarter student primarily Mechanical Engineering department asked find use standard
This literature type obviously important engineering often cited thesis dissertation field studied
This second study provides needed balance study described
Liaisons use study others like build curriculum introduce student level culture field

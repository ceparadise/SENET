Since nobody bothered say yet
Is cry dismay crazy imperial system still misspell arrrrrr
recursively dismayed misspelling arrrrr
Might well I saw something Pirates Caribbean America Metric System something McDonalds
Now American I know America metric system
There thing The metric system American Metric System
The metric system form torture used child child know darn well outside schoolhouse adult refuse speak Metric try looked suspicion birtherism
And supposed unit McDonalds I gon na call right say actually European conspiracy slander good nation probably invade pillage cheese punishment
The one good thing nation drug problem introduced metric weight volume young people especially inner city
I saying pirate pirate
British currency went decimal penny pound
Before penny shilling shilling pound
farthing penny penny thrupenny bit thrupence thrupences sixpence sixpence shilling bob bob florin florin sixpence half crown half crown note note pound penny pound shilling guinea two article one one people evolving
I explain conspiracy right
Sit Dear Child listen wake
They want click
All conspiracy secretly conspiracy
All beginning time end time conspiracy get click
Whatever
As long still know gotten yet
Never click
Never
It like Snow Crash
If United States like rest world McDonald Quarter Pounder might known McDonald Uh much UK metric system required thing law McDonalds Quarter Pounder called Quarter Pounder thats product name
Its weight may given metric alter product name
In France Royal reason thats product name
In UK still buy Club Hammer Rubber Mallet gorilla still gorilla requirement metric change thing
The speech Pulp Fiction cool much based reality
Not sure I seen hammer sold Oz
And gorilla adopted American phrase condescend imperial measure body weight stone
Not sure I seen hammer sold Oz
Here go B Q And Wickes well And gorilla adopted American phrase condescend imperial measure body weight stone
Its still regardless reason
Interesting
I got mine RS sell gram
There seems split engineering trade one
It common phrase
I never heard someone use conversation opposed internet
Britain metric
We still order pint beer road sign speed limit us mile metric
My pant still measured inch people would order construction material inch foot even plan drawn millimeter
I could tell tyre pressure psi would sure Kpa
Apart though definitely metric
The timber yard seem sell metric measurement round
Large board
Look Jewson Gibbs Dandy etc
Technically US us like British Imperial unit derived older English unit exactly
Frankly modern Slashdot I expected see something Russians interfering adoption metric system behest Donald Trump
I thought US afraid metric general population feared one step closer universal health care thrust upon
The metric system use scientific community unfair say used
Some people afraid step
If United States like rest world McDonald Quarter Pounder might known McDonald John Henry hammer would kilogram gorilla room would likely weigh kilo
It would gram patty kilo hammer half ton gorilla
There need precise conversion good easy number marketing people idiom pioneer would
But iambic pentameter become half iambic decameter iambic meter
And instead pounding sand one half kilogram sand gram bunch time
How many liter go Spanish galleon
Getting thrashed within centimeter life sound way close comfort thrashed within meter close enough get point across
And get started kiloseconds
And instead pounding sand one half kilogram sand gram bunch time
Pounding sand NOT refer weight hitting sand mallet compact
When last time checked actual weight patty US Quarter Pounder
The rolling mill produce basic raw material used manufacturing
There two kind long product wire rod wide product sheet plate
All come standard size gauge fraction inch
gauge inch example
All nut bolt etc derived long product SAE
It significant monumental change change tooling f Could done
Sure could
But would cost u serious money corporate office willing pay even engineer scientist floor ready even begging
Engineers scientist fixed
We draw plan metric
Then ship overseas manufacturing
Financing come offshore money parked Ireland Channel Islands
American corporate office increasingly meaningless
They sell paper
Do daft
Switching metric mean retool thing
We n Canada year back
Lumber mill still make sheet plywood SAE tool still sold
My Dad machinist still used thou
Most factory changed equipment replaced
The thing forced change thing like commercial scale gas pump new stuff like car speedometer metric
Things like meat advertised pound sold kilo peo Was like year short period actual piracy Caribbean Atlantic fizzle
Have pirate research Disney movie
You research current news piracy Caribbean year old problem My car get forty rod hogshead way I like
Most electric vehicle manufacturer specify battery capacity kWh
For reason BMW us Ah dumb half information need compare
Maybe point
If course none tell usable capacity
A battery maybe usable typical EV
I first grade California started teaching u metric system
That went couple year returned English Measure Nixon left office
I see Metrics I took trig
Here paragraph Nixon letter Congress An important step could great significance fostering technological innovation enhancing position world trade changing metric system measurement
The Secretary Commerce submitted Congress legislation would allow u begin develop carefully coordinated national plan bring change
The proposed legislation would bring together broadly representative board private citizen would work sector society planning transition
Should change decided would implemented cooperative voluntary basis
Source gained additional support pirate ditty refer piece ten
Well really thankfully physic chemistry course metric subject matter still difficult US unit would make worse least
Interesting article unfortunately slashdotters left corny remark
In seemed serious mention The Metric Conversion Act reminded time
Other day I came across paperback junque collection get ready metric system
I also remember seeing article group Stop We comment still mention The Church Flying Spaghetti Monster revelation And friend
Not pirate cause adoption imperial system USA Poe Law disclaimer yes I kidding
America inching way towards metric system
You made worse skipping yard chain chain furlong metric
furlong mile
I might wrong I thought yard rod rod chain yard acre rod chain
I sure furlong wrong someone used rod yard furlong
Complicated much
Esoteric perhaps least human scale rather one visualise comprehend
Since metric stay regardless scale measurement easier use across multiple scale social history There reason called customary unit
They contrived convenient highly specialized closely related task
For example rod typical length medieval
If laid line rod long got furlong length furrow man single ox could plow without giving animal rest
If lay rectangle furlong four rod acre could plow day
Customary unit far convenient task optimized
But modern need complex calculation relating thing across problem domain make awkward
But error margin
The age ox alone would probably difference could furlong per day
So yes make sense unit comparison like whale weighing something like small car many Libraries Congress USB Stick hold
But actual measurement
Customary unit far convenient task optimized
But modern need complex calculation relating thing across problem domain make awkward
Which US scientist use metric everyone else normal everyday life continues use convenient unit always
The Farenhiet scale another example definition make scale strong mnemonic certain situation set best guess time human body internal temperature
They got within fraction degree
When temperature approach exceed F enough relax getting overheated
You must stay hydrated suffer heat stroke risk death
zero set coldest temperature could easily repeatedly generate lab The melting point pure ice saturated salt sea level pressure etc
This important driving state salt road winter
When temperature degree F go negative salt stop working
Drive VERY carefully end ditch risking death
Given situation deadly AND rare nice easy remember round number flag
Meanwhile boiling freezing point water used often enough get memorized
With C zero boil freeze remember important number heat stroke deadly road condition
Roller coaster fun make life enjoyable
Driving across Kansas
Not much Roller coaster fun make life enjoyable
Driving across Kansas
Not much No doubt
Footlong hotdog could exist metric system
That alone enough reason
We metric Canada still buy foot long hotdog well quarter pounder etc
Just receipt measured sold unit show metric
So buy foot rope actually rung meter rope
Sure long someone foot
Now want hectogram cheese
But American system suck even comparing similar unit
How many fluid ounce cubic inch
Why course
How many pound gallon water weigh

Now let try metric How many cubic centimeter milliliter

How many kg liter water

A pint pound world around
There cubic inch gallon
Now divide yard neatly
A pint pound world around
One pint water weighs pound
There cubic inch gallon
Cool
That handy need gallon exactly cubic inch
But note density water At temperature le
For purpose baking thing people actually routinely pint pound
Nope
There cubic inch gallon
What say
There two different gallon World
How messed
A pint pound world around
You going get surprise ever order beer England
Your pint larger think
It also lukewarm slightly chewy another issue
Oh I think old joke one form go Which weighs pound gold pound feather
The weigh
But American system suck even comparing similar unit
How many fluid ounce cubic inch
Why course
How many pound gallon water weigh

You want know often I want convert fl oz cubic inch
Or find weight gallon water
The answer first never second rarely I Google
We probably better using metric system debatable best whether advantage worth cost required change
The strongest advantage probably standardization country rather ease use
How many cubic centimeter milliliter

How many kg liter water

How boring
Not even remotely interesting
Where good metric joke
How far would go meet
It half bad
The difference celsius kelvin scalar offset
Celsius also convenient feature freezing point water zero
The one bad farenheit
You add AND multiply get something sensible
IMO America easily move liter liquid measurement Americans already familiar liter beverage size
A US liquid quart liter close enough people probably would notice difference everyday use
Celsius get everything wrong
high deal negative number lot often
way high also pointless see water boil
And result temperature care narrow range
I disagree
Celsius plenty precision everyday use difference matter normal people difference
If actually need precision use decimal like would Fahrenheit I sure hell hope use fraction temperature
also make lot sense freezing point Simple measurement fine system fraction thereof
It conversion imperial start really suck
Imperial multiple different unit scheme various thing FlOz based volumetric system two cubic linear measurement imperial foot survey foot based
Fun thing UNC tap required drill size stamped size meric
Imperial pretty simple especially switching mm inch
A gallon lb water course translates fl oz like lb ounce
The problem America use Imperial rather old English measure
At least switch inch back keeping American inch surveying
If really want see US move metric system stop using soft metric
People US think metric system complicated always told convert English Metric measure metric non integral
No lb hammer would kilogram
would kilogram
And Quarter Pounder would Grammer
If want think metric start integer metric measure worry conversion
I remember Jimmy Carter trying move US metric I saw giant sign said inch equal cm
Think Metric
At moment I knew metric dead US
r Jimmy Carter trying move US metric I saw giant sign said inch equal cm
Think Metric
At moment I knew metric dead US
It dead centimetre deprecated unit SI system adopting
The SI base length metre unit derived base multiple division
Hence next unit smaller meter millimetre next unit larger kilometre
I work engineering design office never use centimeter unit dressmaker anything
In field centimetre might dead dead unit SI system
It used time Canada
It perfect unit people visualize cm
It harder visualize mm And people used inch closest unit
And centimetre dead centilitre would dead reasoning
While use Canada use millilitre centilitre sometimes used small volume Europe
I recently bought bottle store home made vinegar made Italy
The sticker said volume cl ml
You see used can pop
It dead centimetre deprecated unit SI system adopting
The SI base length metre unit derived base multiple division
Hence next unit smaller meter millimetre next unit larger kilometre
I work engineering design office never use centimeter unit dressmaker anything
Nonsense
There nothing SI say prefix like centi deci used good match measuring mean use
I live SI country
The customary unit everything use whatever scale prefix make sense
Cans bottle glass measured millilitre pronunced mil short reservoir measured megalitres
Road sign kilometre
Weather report give air pressure hectopascals
The energy content food measured kilojoules
We cope
And beauty metric system Even mm instead cm used kind style guide still use decimal prefix reason converting easy adding slashing decimal
Reagan dead set killing many Carter goal energy conservation metric system much like Trump dead set anything Obama ever
But definition inch mm cm even America switched modern inch back fifty kept old weird inch surveying
As thing like quarter pounder
We metric Canada since mid McDonalds still sell quarter pounder hammer still measured ounce still buy lumber sheet plywood grocery store advertise price pound kg small print though receipt show metric mea If really want see US move metric system make using anything else illegal punishable jail time big fine
Or le drastic start government could stop using customary unit
If highway sign labeled term km people would get used using
Municipal water gas service could charge liter well though I sure many people actually pay attention detail
Or biggest one stop using customary u You done coast coast trip see single speed limit sign
Not single mile next exit sign
No City mile sign
No crossing next mile
No lane end
None
You must unobservant person ever I hope driving
Neither u customary unit
What inch

Ditto cup pound
The time get nice multiple converting foot inch even need nice even number work
Whats one third
Meanwhile using metric measure something scale foot near enough nothing magical foot indeed easily divisible etc
Most importantly math need metric simple integer arithmetic US customary constantly juggle mixed fraction head accomplish anything
You ca even fall back simpler improper fraction ruler planet label
What inch
Versus
Or scaling want shelf apart total distance
Now try thing per shelf
If inch accuracy enough metric measurement rounded multiple
At inch even
Keeps math easy
About claim I heard customary actually advantage specify precision along measurement realistically rarely hear people give measurement And frankly weight volume even uglier mess customary
Not mention endless confusion headache caused fact measure thing weight rather mass rather letting scale conversion far general unit u
Be may hate Metric system freedom divisible
First want use easily converted unit next thing know checking thumb scale reading receipt
It stifle creativity
A hunk meat sold oz pound prime factorization easier divide smaller bit one sold measure unit prime factorization
Well look bright side
A government powerful enough force people use metric powerful enough lot really awful stuff The French Republican Calendar French calendrier franÃais also commonly called French Revolutionary Calendar calendrier franÃais calendar created implemented French Revolution used French government year late What going year
Well started badly indeed And ended Napoleon made First Consul Be happy still free use non metric measurement
It sign US war independence end like French revoluti Australia managed switch metric without kind upheaval
The two necessarily tied together
I consider metric clock day calendar also divided
The first iteration metric right French revolution included day hour minute
The month renamed antique Romanesque hodgepodge March became Germinal month thing grew October became Brumaire foggy month November became Nivôse snowy month
But people wanted integer divisible unit used reminded new month name made sense Paris
In place like Martinique Réunion new name made sense
Nobody say metric system difficult
What say different compelling reason change
There denying changing would enormous price tag nobody ever list single benefit average American would see change
The people claim something hard people ca seem wrap head around anything multiple apparently also suck fraction
And nobody ever say All still answer basic question
OK UK made change
Exactly impoved anyone life result change
Fahrenheit make much sense Celsius weather Fahrenheit scaled better weather temperature
This exactly wrong
Celsius perfect based water standard pressure
If zero normal water freeze
If water boil
It intuitive
This mean say Celsius mean wide range temperature
Oh no
A degree centigrade twice degree Fahrenheit
This end world
The swing Funny height one argument I use FOR metric I live Canada tend use foot inch height I lot European friend look like I stupid I use
perfectly good height centimetre
What weird using two different unit
That um inch
Or foot

It worth mentioning kilogram redefined year version Dombey carrying probably exactly mass modern kilogram artifact stored France
Even object likely become obsolete next year kilogram expected redefined physical artifact instead something related fundamental constant nature
Would really made difference Dombey able deliver kilogram Jefferson
We know sure seems like missed opportunity say Martin
This occasion United States could gone metric
According document NIST website Congress authorized use metric system country supplied state set standard metric weight measure
In United States signed establishing international body maintain metric standard
In weight measure used country defined respect metric standard
So pound officially defined kilogram yard meter
The declared policy United States designate metric system measurement preferred system weight measure United States trade commerce
This act later amended Omnibus Foreign Trade Competitiveness Act Savings Construction Act Department Energy Computing Revitalization Act aimed pushing routine use metric system far without much success
So stuck Quarter Pounders hammer

This guide help track measure impact research data whether
It provides overview key impact measurement concept service tool available measuring impact
After discussing current issue challenge provides tip increasing impact data
This guide interest researcher principal investigator working research administrator working research quality assessment submission librarian others helping track impact data within institution
By Alex Ball DCC Monica Duke DCC Published June Browse guide
A key measure worth research impact put another way difference making within academic community beyond
In recent year funding body placed increasing emphasis monitoring potential actual impact research project fund distinct evaluating intrinsic academic quality value research output judged solely academic
Since NSF judged merit research proposal intellectual merit broader impact
In UK impact plan became part bidding process Research Councils though purpose plan clarified reformulating Pathways Impact
In part proposal researcher asked consider might maximise academic societal economic impact research
At end research lifecycle Research Excellence Framework REF UK included impact explicit element alongside output environment
Submissions form case study social economic cultural benefit impact arising research activity
Furthermore Higher Education Funding Council England HEFCE one agency responsible REF undertook review role metric research assessment considered might used ass quality academic research broader impact
There many reason underlying emphasis impact
For one provides tangible evidence benefit weigh cost research
For another provides engaging way comparing peer research programme across globe albeit lens proxy indicator undertaking strategic benchmarking
It however ideal making comparison across discipline one pattern impact operating different timescale
In order accommodate difference far possible funders tend take account wide variety way research influential
This mean going beyond traditional bibliometric analysis academic output consider wider societal need met research effort
Research impact influencing practice policy generating wealth driving industrial innovation tackling pressing societal question problem meeting need particular community
It therefore interest researcher institution track impact research
An obvious place start impact research output including datasets
Admittedly prospect using quantitative measure assessing impact without controversy
Social political concern include encroachment academic freedom creativity effect researcher working culture measurement
The limitation measured must also recognised awareness needed specific type impact recorded may comprehensive especially given broad consideration impact could
The output tool tracking impact must also carefully considered
As discussed due immaturity area measurement may comparable
A note caution must sounded using derived data decision making knowledge strength weakness different metric must taken account
Researchers however start use metric indicator impact follow potential lead could become basis demonstrating impact case study
Furthermore monitoring usage shared datasets researcher get know form data preparation data publication work best adjust practice accordingly
By tracking reusing data researcher may uncover opportunity collaboration among peer may identify community even though original intended audience
public interest data
Institutions benefit data usage monitoring come As example latter point October Engineering Physical Sciences Research Council EPSRC set clarification expectation research organisation fund
It explained organisation expected log request access data hold recommended also likewise data researcher deposited elsewhere Expectation III
Not log valuable indicator impact along measure interest inform decision data retention
In particular EPSRC stated expect dataset retained interest shown period year Expectation VII
These consideration important wider movement improve quality transparency increase efficiency widen opportunity academic research data sharing
Narrative account data sharing used advocate cultural change
Meanwhile data metric may used incentivise data sharing within framework professional advancement reward recognizes data fundamental research output
Impact figurative sense effect influence one agent event resource another
It distinct related concept many people know entity widely resource distributed
When considering proposed metric therefore important consider exactly measured strength evidence provides impact entity one interested
For example citation count often used measure influence paper subsequent literature discipline
They true measure paper may cited reason acknowledging influence
part refutation acknowledge unused line enquiry serve useful proxy measure
In aggregrate citation count used proxy measure impact entity author funding body weaker level confidence
The example measure researcher impact productivity derived citation count paper
Researchers index exactly published paper cited time
This way aggregating citation count mean researcher produce highly cited paper quantity order score highly large quantity poorly cited paper influential paper enough
Another measure derived citation count Journal Impact Factor JIF gauge impact journal given year
It defined mean number citation received paper published journal preceding two year paper published journal year question
The official JIFs calculated Thomson Reuters paper indexed Web Knowledge published product
Despite measure impact journal constituent paper often used proxy measure prestige journal thereby controversially impact author whose paper published journal
There compelling argument using JIF simplistic manner
It longer case prohibitively time consuming apply metric article author individual basis
Furthermore measuring impact entity indirect mean happens JIF provides incomplete picture
This one reason funding body far reluctant use metric directly preferring narrative case study explore full range possible impact
For example show type impact recognised BBSRC
Specifically impact researcher includes The variety impact recognised UK Biotechnology Biological Sciences Research Council No one metric hope represent fairly possibility worth exploring variety metric used
As noted risk concern reading much given statistic metric provide accessible way uncovering evidence might suitable use impact case study
Traditionally attempted measure impact journal research published proxy impact research
However method becoming increasingly problematic research created disseminated digitally form beyond traditional journal article
Andy Wesolek The mature emerging model measuring impact data one analogous publication citation literature
Going beyond mere data sharing data simply made available
file website data publication implies data entered framework checking quality ensuring fit reuse making searchable discoverable guaranteeing accessibility
The resulting dataset given stable bibliographic information reliably cited scholarly output
Such citation counted usual manner provide evidence impact dataset subject limitation described
The analogy taken datasets meaningfully make reference well receive citation
One suggested formal mechanism package data within research object rich metadata
If idea gain traction derived data product could cite source data referencing data product research object providing complementary citing network alongside publication
While direct citation datasets far widespread may considered aspirational end goal discipline taking transitional approach citation made instead
This paper describes dataset collection without drawing scientific conclusion
Such paper may published special section regular journal dedicated
Citations data paper may interpreted citation underlying dataset purpose assembling evidence impact
In many discipline however dominant approach traditional one citing first paper make use data relying paper indicate data shared
It usually possible least without significant manual effort identify whether citation paper count towards impact argumentation conclusion paper underlying dataset
In discipline therefore citation count little help indicator data impact alternative indicator must found
Many datasets given persistent unique identifier assist unambiguous referencing many scheme use resolvable
In word bridge service map identifier one Internet location
One scheme Digital Object Identifier DOI DataCite main Registration Agency research datasets
Among service provides DataCite Statistics show monthly basis number time top ten DOIs prefix resolved URL
Account holder access resolution data DOIs manage
These statistic give indication often reference dataset followed
Web server log interaction client analysing log possible count approximately many time webpage opened browser
Some site additionally embed page JavaScript code notifies analysis application time page viewed
Either way statistic used infer level interest page
When datasets made available online best practice provide corresponding webpage displaying catalogue record dataset
At minimum one would expect page display dataset title statement responsibility short description download link instruction gain access
The number time dataset catalogue page viewed give indication level interest dataset level awareness existence
Web server log also used count number time data file downloaded
This indicates stronger level interest data inferred count catalogue page view since implies desire look actual data statistic alone reveal use downloaded data might put
At time writing number repository data archive make download statistic openly available quite small one VectorBase several others known collect use internally
For example UK Data Service Discover catalogue put search result order least downloaded
Perhaps alternative metric closest reference journal article measure topicality dataset social medium platform
If people moved share discus dataset friend colleague wider world likelihood affected way meaning worth looking closer evidence impact
Twitter social networking tool enables user send short message known tweet follower
As limited character tweet lend immediate reaction brief sentiment
A tweet referring piece research might contain link say research output project website blog post discus accompanied comment
Detecting tweet relate dataset tricky possible search strategy look mention dataset identifier link catalogue page
Once tweet found accurate picture impact dataset useful consider whether tone tweet positive negative neutral analysing traditional citation
It also informative track ensuing conversation reply forward retweets indicate far others agree sentiment original tweet
It noted cultural dimension tweeting example community considered professional activity academic
Applying altmetrics data could even useful paper data well cited much interest used Eleanor Beal via Twitter Social bookmarking bibliographic service used quite widely Twitter much le noisy source evidence interest scholarly output
Services Mendeley CiteULike BibSonomy Delicious allow user record online resource reference recommend others
While functionality offered service differs one typically discover many user bookmarked particular link resource
Some notably Digg Reddit also provide information many user resource may give impression whether resource positive impact
Several blogging platform use system linkbacks track conversation blog
When new post written Blog A old post Blog B Blog A sends notification Blog Blog B use information incorporate extract new post comment old one
If data repository archive set receive linkbacks use monitor particular datasets mentioned among publishing platform supporting protocol
One proposed innovation field scholarly communication use peer review method quality control
While yet establish practice several place review may found Faculty integral part publication service reviewing literature PubPeer
While emphasis date reviewing journal paper move apply principle datasets well
The data paper submitted data journal example given brief internal review published companion title anyone able submit review
Only paper satisfactorily passed public review phase proceed publication main journal
While peer review concerned quality rather impact text nature review may reveal evidence reuse
There suggestion data archive might invite downloaded reused data leave feedback dataset landing page
Not would provide scalable source peer review insight make data reusable would also provide confirmation researcher attempted use data case successful reuse data made impact

project used crowdsourcing analyse classify tweet link scholarly paper

The project carried December January website longer available code used available GitHub
Many tool available measuring impact data early stage development
There wide variance measure difference measure
For tool aggregating large number source unclear whether attempt made deduplicate result
merging citation counted Scopus Web Science
The result different tool therefore directly comparable depending rate development tool measure may even comparable time
Which measure truly valuable noisy still matter debate
Put another way yet clear reliable measure true impact merely indicator attention received
It arguable example proportion tweet resource represent real engagement proportion simply passing interesting title
Among available measure traditional citation count highly regarded even proponent altmetrics recognise cultural change work required funders put level trust alternative recognise output datasets valuable journal article
Until consensus reached appropriate suite metric unlikely relied upon heavily apportioning reward researcher
Even though currently available metric may stable enough judge relative impact still used basis evidence impact absolute sense
Altmetrics data right building picture fuzzy though may impact richer broader nuanced anything ever seen
Right today altmetrics mean difference story story pretty important difference
Jason Priem As discussed distinction made
While two related many reason resource might impactful high low quality
David Colquhoun example point paper whose title abstract speak popular concern
diet health body part may widely mentioned social medium regardless quality
Indeed many academic voice objection use metric alternative traditional object emphasis shifting away quality towards impact
While researcher great deal control quality output level impact receive especially judged set metric depends many factor outside influence
Nobody really know exactly mean scoring attention quality
At stage collecting data seeing
Euan Adie Altmetric Gaming metric described behaviour meant unfairly manipulate metric generally one An example traditional bibliometrics citation ring group author agree cite extensively regardless actual mutual impact paper
If tweet considered evidence impact setting hundred fake Twitter account tweet one work would example gaming system
On hand tweeting one work would considered unethical neither would repository setting account automatically tweet new deposit
The consensus still emerging line lie two extreme acceptable promotion cheating even acceptable practice need recognised factored calculation
Given time take write paper bring publication often substantial lag resource published receiving first citation
This especially true Arts Humanities publication cycle tend much longer Sciences
With social medium delay reaction almost instant
There argument therefore altmetrics suited measuring immediate impact traditional citation reliable measuring impact
This easier argument make journal paper monograph data reason outlined datasets may receive representative number citation
It noted taking view impact long timescales change landscape significant effect
Due growth usage service like Twitter Facebook impact resource measured raw tweet post naturally seem le back time one go simply fewer user
Similarly data citation become commonplace might consider significantly high citation count today may seem raw number relatively low future
Over long timescales change understanding also play part work ignored many year becoming highly influential
In circumstance impact metric may give underestimate importance work due catch impact accrued work published time
Although complete seamless infrastructure service tool monitoring measurement impact data yet available measure taken using existing facility element infrastructure
The measure impact discussed guide rely resource stable location cited quoted statistic might collected
The effective straightforward way achieving stability deposit data appropriate custodial environment preserved visible foreseeable future
When choosing repository impact mind many different issue consider For guidance choosing repository please see DCC checklist Where Keep Data Key For dataset significant impact must discoverable understandable reusable
All three require data creator provide additional information dataset
information help others find dataset
The basic element discovery metadata one would find typical reference title creator date publisher location identifier
More advanced element include abstract subject keywords geospatial coverage temporal coverage
Precisely element needed depends discipline archive involved good starting point DataCite Metadata Schema designed discovery metadata standard
information would help given set user understand data
For tabular data might include information data point collected unit used
For coded data would include code book
Such information also count information reuser would need extract new knowledge data combine datasets
The thorough useful set metadata provide though support
In experimental context mean information needed experiment confirm result
In observational context mean information needed derive final result raw data collect new data may legitimately compared contrasted original
Again appropriate level metadata provide highly
Disciplinary norm guidance appropriate schema sometimes available repository organisation often define minimum requirement deposit
The DCC provides information metadata standard defined various discipline
More specific advice provided example BioSharing Global Earth Observation System Systems GEOSS Standards Interoperability Registry SIR Marine Metadata Interoperability MMI project Content Standard References
Though still early stage ORCID Open Researcher Contributor Identifer gaining traction way identifying researcher across many different system
By claiming ORCID ID associating output wherever possible prepare future service able read profile search us ID online
Another key factor impact accessibility
If researcher prevented discouraged accessing data due paywalls restriction data impact work
Some restriction necessary example arising legal ethical requirement however restriction needed data made open access
Regardless whether access restriction applied data may desirable require user registration prior access
Whilst registration impose extra step therefore potential barrier data access used tracking monitoring pattern data use
It also make easier enforce restriction use pertain data maximum impact restriction minimum necessary comply legal ethical obligation
If researcher concerned legal implication reusing data inhibit impact work
By applying licence waiver data creator provide unambiguous statement us permitted allaying concern
For information licensing data please see DCC guide How License Research Depositing dataset well used repository indexed popular discovery service great first step ensuring visible
To take thing direct way draw attention potential reusers dataset
The first obvious one cite dataset publication draw
For information please see DCC guide How Cite Datasets Link Another possibility publish data paper describes dataset particularly valuable discipline data citation rarely published worth considering context
Less formal reference also effective
Including reference dataset within service ResearchGate Mendeley help make visible fellow user search engine
Similarly mentioning dataset blog post Twitter Facebook help bring greater attention compelling story surrounding help propagate message normal sharing mechanism
In case important include dataset identifier make much easier impact measurement tool track interest dataset spread social medium

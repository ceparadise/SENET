I bit confused identifier
In textbook say We use identifier name variable many thing Java
I really sure mean
Is like assigning variable variable
What
So far I getting impression Is identifier
When say Using identifier name variable identifier like thing used categorize variable
Please provide example
You think identifier variable name
I would get worked
For example In example identifier refers variable name
If variable function Then would still identifier would identify function
Just Reena identify person An identifier name variable
So variable identifier actual text way referring variable
It possible learn later multiple identifier variable kinda like real life person multiple name
Do worry much right keep trying focusing important stuff like loop conditionals class etc
Identifier name variable variable storage location point memory location data read modified I agree GNU C definition say token C keywords identifier operator constant separator
The go Java
identifier defined keyword
Operators excluded list valid identifier symbol
Constants value name refers constant identifier
Basically group valid identifier symbol identifier long list keywords
In Java valid identifier symbol Unicode letter digit dollar underscore
Digits first symbol
Dollars underscore though valid used exception separator constant identifier like
Identifier like name user define function Here name function gcd identifier
And variable us assigining value may vary executaion In two expression first declare variable second assign value
Here b variable
In Java identifier name given program element program element could package type class interface enum annotation field enum constant annotation type element method local parameter
Essentially identifier identifies program element
For example following code If I understand correctly seems example context variable name Identifiers Variable definition int myVariable technically speaking variable assigned value
myVariable Identifier name create store variable I typically work generic idea referring Identifiers variable wanted get technical make distinction name create store variable name value stored name value
Identifiers word clarifying variable variable space within ram store data
Example declare variable word identifier variable declared enter integer data Keywords reserved word Python
We use keyword variable name function name identifier
They used define syntax structure Python language
In Python keywords case sensitive
You always get list keywords current version typing following prompt
Identifier name given entity like class function variable etc
Python
It help differentiating one entity another
Identifiers combination letter lowercase z uppercase A Z digit underscore
Names like myClass valid example
An identifier start digit
invalid perfectly fine
Keywords used identifier
We use special symbol like etc
identifier
File line SyntaxError invalid syntax Identifier length
Python language
This mean Variable variable
Always name identifier make sense
While c valid
Writing count would make sense would easier figure even look code long gap
Multiple word separated using underscore
We also use style writing capitalize every first letter word except initial word without space
For example camelCaseExample I would say fact place RAM save value
A name give region
Of course identifier name variable
A function pack code parameter also name
A type value domain also name
A class type function member
For example value
Even integer
What want manage integer
You need storage region save integer name refer storage region need define kind value want save region name refer specify type
So write something like If Java parser see sentence following structure know creating storage region
The first part specifies type value region intended mean specify writting type identifier type type abstract notion example abstract notion something integer
The second part name want give region use later refering storage region using name simpler using mean example memory direction whatever left language manage
In simple word variable something occupy space memory identifier name location
Identifiers name given thing Java
This includes variable method class etc
So technically variable identifier
see Regarding confusion I really sure mean
Is like assigning variable variable
What
correct way saying Assigning name variable name would like variable

Identifier Definition An identifier simply name program name variable within program used identify relevant
Typically identifier must start letter must space
Search Identifier UK US Search Identifier rest Computing Students

An identifies label either unique object unique object object class may idea physical countable object class thereof physical noncountable substance class thereof
The abbreviation often refers identity identification process identifying identifier identification
An identifier may word number letter symbol combination
The word number letter symbol may follow wherein letter digit word symbol represent idea longer name may simply arbitrary
When identifier follows encoding system often referred
Identifiers follow encoding scheme often said arbitrarily assigned greater meaning
Sometimes identifier called code even actually arbitrary whether speaker belief deeper meaning simply speaking casually imprecisely
The identifier refers one particular object universe
A identifier needed identify part design
Thus Model T identifies automobile Ford comprises whereas Model T Serial Number identifies one specific member one particular Model T car owned one specific person
The concept equal term thus denotatively always synonymous often connotatively distinguished name sense traditional naming
For example employee number identifier specific human normal connotation may consider Jamie Zawinski name identifier whereas considers Netscape employee number identifier name
This indistinction rather one
In label sign token uniquely identifies object within
The suffix also used naming
ID code may inherently carry along
For example know food package front identifier data also metadata tell packaged September UTC manufactured Licensed Vendor Number Peoria IL USA plant Building package line shift inspected Inspector Number
Arbitrary identifier might lack metadata
For example food package say ID may tell anything except date manufacturer name production sequence rank inspector number
In case arbitrary identifier sequential serial number leak information

Opaque designed avoid leaking even small amount really
In name
Identifiers used extensively virtually
Identifying entity make possible refer essential kind symbolic processing
In identifier also called name language entity
Some kind entity identifier might denote include
Which character sequence constitute identifier depends language
A common rule sequence underscore also allowed condition begin digit simplify lexing avoiding confusing allowed definition used earlier version Python many language
Later version language along many modern language support almost character identifier
However common restriction permit whitespace character language operator simplifies tokenization making
For example forbidding identifier due use binary operation mean tokenized allowed would identifier addition
Whitespace identifier particularly problematic space allowed identifier clause legal identifier tokenizing requires phrasal context condition clause
Some language allow space identifier however ALGOL variant example following valid statement could entered keywords represented boldface concretely via
In ALGOL possible keywords syntactically differentiated risk collision ambiguity space eliminated phase source processed via lexing could
In language character sequence lexical form identifier known example frequently keyword clause lexically form namely sequence letter
This overlap handled various way may forbidden identifier simplifies tokenization parsing case may allowed distinguished way via stropping keyword sequence may allowed identifier sense determined context requires lexer
may also reserved word forbidden identifier particularly case word may become keyword future
In language distinction clear
The scope accessibility within program identifier either local global
A global identifier declared outside function available throughout program
A local identifier declared within specific function available within function
For implementation programming language using identifier often entity
That compiled program contains reference memory address offset rather textual identifier token memory address offset assigned compiler identifier
In language support interactive evaluation source code using interpreter incremental compiler identifier also runtime entity sometimes even freely manipulated evaluated
In called
Compilers interpreter usually assign semantic meaning identifier based actual character sequence used
However exception
For example In language Go identifier uniqueness based spelling visibility
In identifier one possible
It unique within document
Many resource may carry multiple identifier
Typical example The inverse also possible multiple resource represented identifier discussed
Many system originate within small
Over year bleed larger namespaces people interact way formerly trade scientific collaboration military alliance general cultural interconnection assimilation
When dissemination happens limitation original naming convention formerly latent moot become painfully apparent often necessitating
Such limitation generally accompany shift away original context broader one
Typically system show implicit context context formerly assumed narrow lack capacity low number possible IDs reflecting outmoded narrow context lack feature defined reserved future need lack specificity disambiguating capability related context shift longstanding uniqueness encounter novel nonuniqueness
Within computer science problem called
The story origination expansion system provides good case example context
The capitalization variation seen reveals instance problem occurring proper noun distinction complication must dealt
A universe every object UID would need namespaces say would constitute one gigantic namespace human mind could never keep track semantically interrelate many UIDs

An identifier C name program element
It namespace class method variable interface
Identifiers symbol used uniquely identify program element code
They also used refer type constant macro parameter
An identifier name indicate meaning usage element referred
C programming language compiled implementation identifier entity
During run time identifier referred reference memory address offset compiler assigned textual identifier token
Like identifier C
Microsoft recommends use Camel Pascal notation along semantics naming identifier instead Hungarian notation used prior programming
For example employeeSalary might represent Camel notation wherein first letter word capitalized except first word
Camel notation used name private member field parameter
EmployeeSalary identifier Pascal notation word identifier begin letter
It usually used type name nonprivate member type
The rule followed using identifier include An identifier prefixed called verbatim identifier
Although prefixing allows use keywords help interfacing programming language recommended practice

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
many part
These may include
Each part given name called
Every part must unique identifier
If programmer want create function procedure program part one must also given different identifier
Identifiers made unique two way Identifiers may case meaning throughout whole program meaning everywhere
Or identifier may case meaning within small part program may defined different meaning different place
Identifiers may also case meaning throughout single module file
This allows u use name different place refer different thing
These name actually different identifier even though casual reader might think
We safely divide programming project smaller component programmer writing one component may choose name local component without worrying name chosen programmer writing component

A collection related structured activity produce specific service product serve particular goal particular customer customer
It may often visualized sequence activity interleaving decision point process matrix sequence activity relevance rule based data process
There three type business process citation Mark von Rosing A business process begin mission objective end achievement business objective
organization break barrier structural department try avoid
A complex business process may decomposed several attribute also contribute achieving goal
The analysis business process typically includes mapping process level
Business process designed add value customer include unnecessary activity
The outcome well designed business process increased effectiveness value customer increased efficiency le use resource
Business Processes modeled large number method technique
For instance technique used drawing business process
An important early description process economist famous example factory
Inspired article Smith described production pin following way One man draw wire another straight third cut fourth point fifth grind top receiving head make head requires two three distinct operation put particular business whiten pin another important business making pin manner divided eighteen distinct operation manufacturies performed distinct hand though others man sometime perform two three Smith also first recognized output could increased use
Previously society production dominated one man would perform activity required production process Smith described work divided set simple task would performed specialized worker
The result labor division Smith example resulted productivity increasing percent sic
number worker made time many pin producing introduction labor division
It worth noting Smith advocate labor division price
The appropriate level task division defined experimental design production process
In contrast Smith view limited functional domain comprised activity direct sequence manufacturing process today process concept includes important characteristic
Following idea division labor adopted widely integration task functional process considered alternative option much later
American engineer greatly influenced improved quality early twentieth century
His focused standardization process systematic training clearly defining role management employee
His method widely adopted United States Russia part Europe led development time motion study visual task optimization technique
In latter part twentieth century management guru focused much work simplification decentralization process led concept
In early US corporation subsequently company world started adopt concept BPR attempt competitiveness lost previous decade
Davenport defines business process structured measured set activity designed produce specific output particular customer market
It implies strong emphasis work done within organization contrast product focus emphasis
A process thus specific ordering work activity across time space beginning end clearly defined input output structure action

Taking process approach implies adopting customer point view
Processes structure organization necessary produce value This definition contains certain characteristic process must posse
These characteristic achieved focus business logic process work done instead taking product perspective done
Following Davenport definition process conclude process must clearly defined boundary input output consists smaller part activity ordered time space must receiver process customer transformation taking place within process must add customer value
Hammer Champy definition considered subset Davenport
They define process collection activity take one kind input creates output value As note Hammer Champy transformation oriented perception put le emphasis structural component process boundary order activity time space
Rummler Brache use definition clearly encompasses focus organization external customer stating business process series step designed produce product service
Most process spanning white space box organization chart
Some process result product service received organization external customer
We call primary process
Other process produce product invisible external customer essential effective management business
We call support The definition distinguishes two type process primary support process depending whether process directly involved creation customer value concerned organization internal activity
In sense Rummler Brache definition follows Porter model also build division primary secondary activity
According Rummler Brache typical characteristic successful organization absence secondary activity primary value flow created customer oriented primary process
The characteristic process spanning white space organization chart indicates process embedded form organizational structure
Also process
range several business function
Johansson et al

define process set linked activity take input transform create output
Ideally transformation occurs process add value input create output useful effective recipient either upstream This definition also emphasizes constitution link activity transformation take place within process
Johansson et al
also include upstream part value chain possible recipient process output
Summarizing four definition compile following list characteristic business process Frequently identifying person responsible continuous improvement process considered prerequisite
Sometimes process owner person performing process
movement information material one activity worksite another
Workflow includes procedure people tool involved step business process
A single workflow may either sequential step contingent upon completion previous one parallel multiple step occurring simultaneously
Multiple combination single workflow may connected achieve resulting overall process
BPR originally conceptualized Hammer Davenport mean improve organizational effectiveness productivity
It consisted starting blank slate completely recreating major business process well use information technology significant performance improvement
The term unfortunately became associated corporate downsizing
also termed BPM cover study identify change monitor business process ensure run smoothly improved time
It continuous evaluation existing process identification way improve upon resulting cycle overall organizational improvement
definition knowledge employee system use perform function maintaining format accessed others
The Gartner Group definition state Knowledge management discipline promotes integrated approach identifying capturing evaluating retrieving sharing enterprise information asset
These asset may include database document policy procedure previously expertise experience individual worker
TQM emerged early organization sought improve quality product service
It followed first introduced Motorola
Six Sigma consists statistical method improve business process thus reduce defect output
The lean approach quality management introduced Toyota Motor Company focused customer need reduction wastage
Advances information technology year changed business process within business enterprise
In operating system limited functionality workflow management system use tailor made specific organization
The saw development approach data storage retrieval technology improved
Data modeling rather process modeling starting point building information system
Business process adapt information technology process modeling neglected
The shift towards process oriented management occurred
Enterprise resource planning software workflow management component SAP Baan Oracle emerged
The world created need automate business process across organization turn raised need standardized protocol web service composition language understood across industry
The BPMN BMM widely used standard business modeling
The Business Modeling Integration Domain Task Force BMI DTF consortium vendor user company continues work together develop standard specification promote collaboration integration people system process information within across enterprise
The recent trend BPM influenced emergence prevalence mobile technology development analytical technique
Cloud based technology allow company purchase resource quickly required independent location
Social medium website smart phone newest channel organization reach support customer
The abundance customer data collected channel well call center interaction email voice call customer survey led huge growth data analytics turn utilized performance management improving way company service customer
Business process comprise set sequential task alternative path depending certain condition applicable performed achieve given objective produce given output
Each process one needed input
The input output may received sent business process internal external stakeholder
Business process designed operated one business functional unit emphasize importance rather individual unit
In general various task business process performed one two way Typically process task manual task may sequenced many way
In word data information handled process may pas manual computer task given order
The improvement area equally applicable policy process
There cascading effect improvement made higher level made lower level
For instance recommendation replace given policy better one made proper justification accepted principle business process owner corresponding change consequent process procedure follow naturally order enable implementation policy Internal control built manual administrative process step computer system procedure
It advisable build many system control possible since automatic always exercised since built design business system software
For instance error message preventing entry received raw material quantity exceeding purchase order quantity greater permissible tolerance percentage always displayed prevent system user entering quantity
However various reason practicality need flexible whatever may signify lack business domain knowledge experience difficulty software cost software incapability computerised system provide control internal control otherwise considered necessary often built business system software
In scenario manual administrative process control outside computer system clearly documented enforced regularly exercised
For instance entering data create new record material system database item master table internal control system provide item description field allow user leave description blank word configure item description mandatory field
The system obviously alert user description wrongly spelled inappropriate nonsensical etc
In absence internal control item creation process must include suitable administrative control detailed checking responsible officer field entered new item comparing taken system item data entry sheet ensuring correction item description similar field system control possible promptly carried
Last least introduction effective manual administrative control usually requires overriding periodic check higher authority ensure control exercised first place
Business process must include accurate ensure effective action
An example availability status report supplier delivery described section effectiveness
There numerous example every possible business process
Another example production process analysis line occurring shop floor
This process include systematic periodical analysis rejection reason present result suitable information report pinpoint major reason trend reason management take control rejection keep within acceptable limit
Such process analysis summarisation line rejection event clearly superior process merely inquires individual rejection occurs
Business operative realise process improvement often occurs introduction appropriate transaction operational highlight exception report provided consciously used periodical
With understanding would hopefully come willingness invest time resource business process improvement introduction useful relevant reporting system
The number subordinate supervisor manages within structural
Introducing business process concept considerable impact structural element organization thus also span control
Large organization organized market need organized smaller unit defined according different principle
organization design strategy related theoretical cornerstone business process concept

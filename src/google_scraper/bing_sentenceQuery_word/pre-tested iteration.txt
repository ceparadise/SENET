When designing algorithm may step need repeating
This known iteration displayed pseudocode flowchart
An plan set instruction solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm These building block help describe solution form ready
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Iteration programming mean repeating step
This often called loop
Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step This make designing algorithm quicker simpler need include lot unnecessary step

When designing program may instruction need repeating
This known iteration implemented programming using FOR WHILE statement
An plan set designed solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm Algorithms used help design perform particular task
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Algorithms consist step carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step The algorithm repeat step cereal milk eaten
This make designing algorithm quicker simpler include lot unnecessary step
Once algorithm designed perfected must translated code computer read
We create program algorithm
Algorithms consist step
Programs consist statement
A statement single instruction word single step
Iteration implemented programming using statement
In programming iteration often referred looping program iterates loop earlier step

The noun sens computer science single execution set instruction repeated computer science executing set instruction given number time specified result obtained saying repeated performance computer science single execution set instruction repeated Nouns denoting natural process iteration solution took hundred iteration sustained phenomenon one marked gradual change series state branch engineering science study aid computer computable process structure computer science executing set instruction given number time specified result obtained Nouns denoting natural process iteration solution obtained iteration sustained phenomenon one marked gradual change series state branch engineering science study aid computer computable process structure Doing saying repeated performance Nouns denoting act action act performing ITEMIZE ITERATE ITERATIVE ITERATIVE ASPECT ITHACA ITHAKI ITHUNN ITINERANT ITINERARY

Iteration context computer programming process wherein set instruction structure repeated sequence specified number time condition met
When first set instruction executed called iteration
When sequence instruction executed repeated manner called loop
Iteration repetition process computer program usually done help loop
An example iteration programming language follows Consider database table containing student record
Each record contains following field If one want copy student record database print best way retrieve record iterate loop record
It executed using loop statement shown int first name last name table In example iterator starting first student record last student record

The past week I learning iterators
I still understand main difference iterating link list traversing one
I know traversing mean go visiting every element link list iterating basically thing different iterate everything standard library
mean walking element data structure
Historically computer science special form recursion additional stack space needed word
This form computationally exactly equivalent colloquially know namely finite loop loop fixed lower upper bound
Now make iteration especially well suited compared general recursion traversing linear data structure
Note work container
general graph need remember already visited node
using defined recursively term adjacent node rather via concept iterators
It context term used applied container
In summary every traversal iteration every iteration data structure traversal
However worth noting many people make distinction use term interchangeably
In particular usage Gerald Sussman fame
But seemingly data structure tree linearised purpose iteration applying thus traversed stack
Note I made definition fit mental model I going
Iteration discrete traversal may may
So traverse range allowable volume analog volume knob speaker iterate
But iteration type traversal
So every iteration traversal every traversal iteration
AFAIK synonymous
What make think difference
I feel traverse sometimes used indicate internal structure exploited
You traverse tree going parentnodes childnodes traverse list following next pointer
An array hand iterate
You element work one one
I would call agent action
Actually often confuses people refer something something related numerical method converging towards mathematical point via iteration
On hand even I use word interchangeably
You container concept
At minimum order something need know least whether neighbor get
A iterator basically give functionality traverse datastructure visiting every element
I would call synonym
There I know programming
Some datastructures information allows
For example stack able traverse though element access top stack

act repeating process either generate unbounded sequence outcome aim approaching desired goal target result
Each repetition process also called iteration result one iteration used starting point next iteration
In context iteration along related technique standard building block
mathematics may refer process
applying function repeatedly using output one iteration input next
Iteration apparently simple function produce complex behaviour difficult problem example see
Another use iteration mathematics used produce approximate numerical solution certain mathematical problem
example iterative method
Manual calculation number square root common use example
computing technique marking block statement within defined number repetition
That block statement said computer scientist might also refer block statement iteration
The pseudocode example iteration line code bracket loop iterate three time It permissible often necessary use value part program outside bracketed block statement perform desired function
In example line code using value increment
In school iteration used describe process teaching guiding student repeat experiment assessment project accurate result found student mastered technical skill
This idea found old adage Practice make perfect
In particular iterative defined process learning development involves cyclical inquiry enabling multiple opportunity people revisit idea critically reflect implication
Unlike computing math educational iteration predetermined instead task repeated success according external criterion often test achieved
In algorithmic situation recursion iteration employed effect
The primary difference recursion employed solution without prior knowledge many time action repeat successful iteration requires foreknowledge
Some type programming language known designed set block statement explicit repetition loop
Instead programming language exclusively use
Rather call block code repeated number time executing code block instead divide work done number separate piece code block executes individual piece
Each piece work divided repeatedly amount work small possibly point algorithm work quickly
The algorithm revers reassembles piece complete whole
The classic example recursion algorithm
The Merge Sort recursive algorithm first repeatedly divide list consecutive pair pair ordered consecutive pair pair forth element list desired order
The code example recursive algorithm programming language output result pseudocode previous heading
In object ensures iteration executed way range different data structure saving time effort later coding attempt
An abstraction accepts reject data iteration

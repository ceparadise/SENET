Technical debt concept programming reflects extra development work arises code easy implement short run used instead applying best overall solution
Technical debt commonly associated extreme programming especially context refactoring
That implies restructuring existing code refactoring required part development process
Under line thinking refactoring result poorly written code also done based evolving understanding problem best way solve problem
Technical debt may also known design debt
The term coined Ward Cunningham programmer also known developing first debt metaphor equates software development financial debt
Imagine project two potential option
One quick easy require modification future
The better design take time implement
In development releasing code quick easy approach like incurring debt come obligation interest technical debt come form extra work future
Taking time refactor equivalent paying principal
While take time short run also decrease future interest payment
Ward Cunningham describes concept follows The concept mean debt never incurred
Just leverage help company used correctly quick solution mean faster time market software development
In addition technical debt poor code
Bad code bad code technical debt result work good programmer unrealistic project constraint

Bring Order From IT Chaos There three primary type Technical Debt Naïve technical debt common specific best practice followed due unaware best design pattern unfamiliar naming convention documentation guideline even coding guideline following abstraction development method serve one purpose
This happens frequently junior level developer even senior developer miss thing result create technical debt
My recommendation would use guideline book Clean Code Robert Martin Pragmatic Programmer Andrew Hunt David Thomas
This include several Extreme programming principle code review refactoring TDD pair programming name
Unavoidable technical debt happen due upgrade development tool bring newer often better way maintain custom solution
Also scope change requested mid development immediate cost
What adding new feature existing web site better support mobile device
This increase debt due rewriting system support multiple modality unless designed first place
In case like last example unavoidable technical debt really naïve technical debt avoided third type technical debt strategic also avoidable instead decided either intentionally unintentionally accrued
For instance skipping proper quality code practice like code review refactoring order make release certain deadline example strategic debt
Continually placing refactoring task bottom product backlog nowhere another example strategic debt
Strategic debt tackled determining actual financial cost technical debt presenting leadership order get buy

Recently concept technical debt SATD proposed considers debt intentionally introduced form quick temporary fix
Prior work SATD shown source code comment used successfully detect SATD however current classification approach SATD rely manual inspection source code comment
In paper proposed automated approach detect SATD source code comment using text mining
In approach utilize feature selection select useful feature classifier training combine multiple classifier different source project build composite classifier identifies SATD comment target project
We investigate performance approach open source project contain comment
Our experimental result show every target project approach outperforms baseline approach term
The achieved approach range average improves approach proposed Potdar Shihab
When compared text baseline approach approach significantly improves average least
When compared natural language baseline approach also significantly improves
Our proposed approach used project personnel effectively identify SATD minimal manual effort

BY SENIOR CUSTOMER TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT If deal customer data platform transaction system analytical probably run across concept technical Wikipedia defines term Technical debt also known design debt code debt concept programming reflects extra development work arises code easy implement short run used instead applying best overall Whether realize every day make decision impact technical debt
As debt increase eventually must pay replacing redesigning system
But technical debt created equally
I suggest two type technical debt
One type inexcusable
The unavoidable
To understand difference let tell tale two city two city technical debt
And sewage
Trust I get
In first European settler would become City Chicago built farm around mouth Chicago River
In Illinois legislature commissioned plan locate canal lay surrounding town
By town population resident
In population boom sparked arrival first railroad line connecting city state
Along opening canal Great Lakes Mississippi caused Chicago become transportation commerce hub
By population grown
By resident
By population
And Chicago crowned traveler filthiest city You see land elevation Chicago virtually nonexistent
The entire boom town basically elevation Lake Michigan
When rain came street became impassable swamp downhill water run
Worse yet downhill sewage run
What much consideration small town canal suddenly became critical roadblock growth city approaching
Success overrun original design Chicago
What Chicago
They elevated entire city much foot
During engineer raised every building street sidewalk
Hydraulic jack manual jackscrew placed hundred every building lifting filling underneath allowing piping underground infrastructure
What amazing raising city amazing enough lifting process done people carried living working building
In one case entire half block Lake Street raised jackscrew men
The raising Briggs House Chicago
Source In end city one first storm water wastewater system country
By population city fifth largest country
The rest say history
In city Dubai stand tallest building Burj Khalifa
At foot tall represents feat modern architectural engineering encompassing technology handle pressure wind sheer weight building content resident movement people usable floor elevator including two double decker lift
But one thing opened
A sewage system
The Burj Khalifa center Dubai The Burj capable catering people population Chicago
Those resident employee traveler generate ton sewage wastewater day
The world tallest building system moving waste base building thank goodness nothing
In zeal build open world tallest building soon possible lest another building beat city planner prioritized
They built skyscraper
They built wastewater treatment plant
But build system pipe pump would connect two
They decided deal central sewer
At point might thinking But building opened must come That
In perhaps finest example engineering kludge history well engineering hundred truck would stop Dubai skyscraper including Burj Khalifa hour day day week collect wastewater drive wastewater treatment plant
At time line truck hour long waiting dump dirty cargo treatment plant
The city Dubai eventually addressed problem significant cost generated truck system rather large PR problem viral video line truck hit Internet
Even today perception Dubai underdeveloped sewage system lingers
The concept technical debt abstract middle product information system design implementation pressure ship bring system soon possible
Or enhancing existing system adapt new product new customer new expectation
I often use example two city make abstract concept technical debt tangible people designing implementing customer information system
They illustrate difference inexcusable unavoidable technical debt
The Burj Khalifa represents form technical purposely designed system start
Dubai wanted ship first accepted cost truck kludge
But also accepted unforecasted cost negative PR risk permanent operational cost
We think situation ended permanent technical debt recovery project delayed cancelled failed
The City Chicago represents form technical generated success unforeseen technological change
The agricultural community thousand transformed development long distance canal invention railroad
Chicago outgrew design technical debt accumulated addressed
We predict every possible technological market advance designing system try may well wrong
Just process predicting forecasting future often lead decision paralysis
But inexcusable almost always justified underestimating risk cost
If organization sustain cost perhaps risk justified
But usually cheat
We want technical debt created success design
Keep mind technical team describe quicker easier path launch

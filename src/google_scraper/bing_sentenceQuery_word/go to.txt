study computer including design architecture us computation system control
The field includes engineering activity design computer hardware make computer system
It also theoretical mathematical activity design performance study system component mean technique like queueing theory estimation reliability availability system probabilistic technique
Since computer system often large complicated allow designer predict failure success without testing experimentation incorporated development cycle
Computer generally considered separate computer engineering although two overlap extensively area design study computer system
The major subdisciplines computer science traditionally architecture including level hardware design well hardware software component form computer system software program set instruction tell computer carry task subdivided software engineering programming language operating system information system database artificial intelligence computer graphic theory includes computational method one hand data structure
Computer science independent discipline date although electronic object study invented two decade earlier
The root computer science lie primarily related field electrical engineering mathematics
provides basic circuit idea electrical impulse input circuit combined produce arbitrary output
The transistor miniaturization circuit along invention electronic magnetic optical medium storage information resulted advance electrical engineering
source one key concept development idea information represented sequence zero one
In number represented sequence binary digit way number familiar decimal system represented using digit
The relative ease two state high low voltage realized electrical electronic device led naturally bit becoming basic unit data storage transmission
The developed century supplied designing circuit binary input value false true respectively terminology logic yield desired combination output
Theoretical work computability began provided needed extension design whole machine milestone specification theoretical device manipulates string British mathematician model computational power
Another breakthrough concept computer usually credited mathematician
This instruction well data stored fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited calculator approach instruction entered one time
The need user application provided main driving force early day computer science still great extent today
The difficulty writing program led first development allows programmer use instruction ADD symbol variable
Such program translated program known assembler binary encoding used computer
Other piece system software known linking loader combine piece assembled load machine main memory unit ready execution
The concept linking separate piece code important since allowed library program built carry common first step toward increasingly emphasized notion software reuse
Assembly language found sufficiently inconvenient language closer natural language invented easier faster programming along came need compiler program translate language program machine code
As programming language became powerful abstract building efficient compiler create code term execution speed storage became interesting computer science problem
Increasing use computer early provided development consist software automatically handle input output execution job
The historical development operating system summarized topic
Throughout history computer machine utilized two major application computational support scientific engineering discipline data processing business need
The demand better computational technique led resurgence interest numerical method area mathematics traced method devised several century ago physicist hand computation made validate theory
Improved method computation obvious potential revolutionize business conducted pursuit business application new information system developed consisted file record stored
The invention allows rapid access arbitrary record disk led cleverly designed file system also concept development sophisticated database management system commonly use
development optimal algorithm inserting deleting locating data major area theoretical computer science since beginning heavy use structure virtually computer compiler operating system file system
Another goal computer science creation machine capable carrying task typically thought requiring
goal known actually predates first electronic computer although term coined introduced early display data crude image paper plot CRT screen
Expensive hardware limited availability software kept field growing early computer memory required became affordable
A bit map binary representation main memory rectangular array point pixel picture element screen
Because first display used one binary bit per pixel capable displaying one two colour commonly black green black amber
Later computer memory assigned binary bit per pixel obtain colour
together display screen development graphic standard make software le led explosive growth field
Software engineering arose distinct area study late part attempt introduce discipline structure software design development process
For thorough discussion development computing see
Architecture deal design computer component hardware creation operating system software control computer
Although designing building computer often considered province computer engineering practice exists considerable overlap computer science
field computer science
From logical vantage point instructive observation offered Dutch Evert Beth independently slightly different form Finnish philosopher Jaakko Hintikka
Both pointed certain proof method Beth called Curry others computer science become branch mathematics
Thus theoretical computer science object study theorem also proof well calculation program algorithm
Theoretical computer science turn close connection investigation idealized computer ramification theory finite automaton mathematical linguistics

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree

said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers

Freelance Writer Think thing every day posting status update downloading song checking class schedule online Do think would cool design technology make device work better
To invent new one
To help make people life job easier
Then maybe right path
But first let set thing straight
Computer scientist people call printer stop working
And sit dark cubicle day without talking anyone
Whatever think computer science wrong say Dianna Xu Chair Computer Science Department Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania
So
Computer scientist use technology solve problem
They write software make computer new thing accomplish task efficiently
They create application mobile device develop website program software
And find everywhere big tech firm government agency startup nonprofit
It everyday computing say Liz Burd Chancellor Learning Teaching University Newcastle Australia
It building tool enable everyday One biggest thing computer science major learn logically think problem find way solve
Chris Stephenson Executive Director Computer Science Teachers Association add good computer scientist also understand teamwork good communicator
They work people time say including come CS background
No matter brilliant point explain someone product work code Stephenson say
Bobby Schnabel Dean School Informatics Computing chair Association Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee say student go computer science like working computer
Others want solve problem technology

Anokwa nine year old first programmed computer
It father used teaching journalism Indianapolis Anokwa allowed touch anyway entering online competition win faster modem
In high school started business repairing computer classmate parent
In college earned two degree one computer science Butler one electrical engineering
There Anokwa began think people could use computing change world better
After computer everywhere desk pocket inside device use every day
Software powerful say
During graduate school Anokwa spent six month volunteering public health organization Rwanda helped introduce electronic medical record system used nationwide
That experience inspired Anokwa develop Open Data Kit platform replaces paper form smart phone tablet computer
Its tool used world
Election observer use monitor poll Egypt health worker Kenya use track effort combat HIV Brazilians use measure illegal logging rainforest
Anokwa partner eventually started company called Nafundi consults client using tool like Open Data Kit
These day I lot programming Anokwa say
Those skill head
All skill I need I learned first couple year Brown meant study philosophy enrolled Lexington Virginia
But also liked tinkering computer
He took class logic class computer programming
It might seem like two subject anything common Brown liked relied logical thinking
It seems like straightforward correlation say
The summer graduating computer science degree went back hometown Memphis Tennessee got job lifeguarding country club
Through someone met found next job helped company find new employee department
Outside work joined informal group programmer
That met founder website called MyRepresentatives
The site make easy people live Memphis area find represents local state federal government
Brown started working site lead developer
It unpaid valuable position
He working MyRepresentatives month landed paid job Lindsey Software company design program public housing agency work today
The computer programming class Lynch took high school one favorite
I liked knowing logic understanding thing work say
How work solve problem She majored computer science Colchester Vermont learned little bit everything computing programming language mathematical principle behind technology managing website attack problem system
The biggest thing degree gave perfect foundation build career Lynch say
In experience general degree
A technical degree general Now technical analyst Esri software company us sophisticated mapping technology called geographic information system GIS
Lynch even know GIS joined Esri imagine working industry
Among thing company software used map damage Hurricane Sandy left East Coast illustrate federal government sent money different project
Lynch design application company use Esri software
In job help customer work colleague develop test application
She like different thing every day
Every month something change I get cutting edge happening field say

A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level

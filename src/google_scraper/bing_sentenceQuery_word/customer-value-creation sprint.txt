In last post I explained agile software development methodology work completed sprint
Although sprint meeting every week helpful important team member meeting clearly review key information factor contributed successful completion task deterrent successful program completion
This exactly agile sprint retrospective
In blog post going examine agile sprint retrospective important
Sprint retrospective meeting help agile team stay track project development process
It held end current sprint start following sprint
Retrospectives attended team member project manager note taker facilitator
The facilitator act like neutral person facilitate lead meeting team able make important decision end meeting
Derby Larsen According Mahnic Zabkar retrospective main topic discussion size code product backlog item total number product backlog item completed total number product backlog item pending
Unlike Scrum meeting fifteen minute long Sutherland Schwaber claim retrospective four hour long Hossain Babar Paik
Due length meeting participation multiple onshore offshore member often difficult find reliable form communication
Hence meeting sometimes held synchronous format video call time held asynchronous format posting result Wikis
Hossain Babar Paik After sprint retrospective team I realized important
The agile sprint retrospective important help increasing efficiency agile allowing team ensure continuous progress
After team first sprint retrospective concluded manner split task effective planning next phase
The identification hindrance allowed team function effectively following sprint
How retrospective help team increase efficiency
Firstly retrospective help team determine amount work required accomplish goal develop timeline project
Secondly meeting facilitator help team generate discussion help determining done increase functionality team
Such discussion also help determining root cause problem occurred identifying factor contributed successful completion task
Finally retrospective help team celebrate past achievement encouraged future project
Kerth From experience I realized couple important thing retrospective worth noting
When retrospective I noted sometimes team member identify different issue root cause problem
It important team come agreement root cause way team rectify issue
But agreeing something mean team one vote impose idea majority minority
Coming agreement long process involves lot interaction discussing various issue conducting multiple vote
During retrospective happened team concludes everything worked perfectly sprint nothing need changed
Although absolutely fine team consider perfect team able improve identify part improve
When lack discussion like question helped team identify feature improve upon Is client happy way interacted
Did provide update constantly
Was lack coordination team
Did different team member request information client multiple time
Did plan properly
Did correctly set sprint goal
Did overestimate underestimate task
What difficult issue deal time
How avoid issue next time
These question usually stir discussion required retrospective
If one opinion everyone agrees opinion team fail identify obstacle success
Our team able improve every sprint increase efficiency able correctly identify deterrent
As long retrospective held properly keeping point mind I believe help increasing efficiency team great extent
The last thing note Kerth suggests every group different dynamic important design retrospective manner fit team culture dynamic
Hence suggestion I made might work team
So make sure design team retrospective suit unique team
In post tried understand agile sprint retrospective contributes efficiency agile
We realized agile retrospective meeting extremely important retrospect team learn important lesson future
Although retrospective might difficult design retrospective designed properly suit team team able see great result
In next post I going explain agile task list important

All business momentum towards operating innovating
It would easy u continue focusing scaling existing Portfolio Companies business create business
Thus needed forcing function ensure rhythm mandate innovate answer Sprint Week
In High Alpha case concept software company address user pain fill market need identified specific industry
Teams chosen build conviction presenting prototype pitch deck
Pitch deck language venture capital contain business
During sprint create brand identity model product establish strategy informed product roadmap headcount assumption
We run Sprint Week six time tactic changed found three rule hold true Three time per year High Alpha employee tell Portfolio Companies unreachable ask significant others expect late night put message one week
During Sprint singular focus one task
We agreed order make limited time together
And physically emotionally
We gone far architect emotional arc entrepreneur journey week
It easy love concept Monday morning tough feel way Tuesday evening user torn prototype shred
We get option say This good At early stage easy kill idea
What truly hard find nugget truth customer interview build business
So Thursday stand front peer passionately say If I start business space I would like It amazing much accomplished hour got nothing calendar
In corporation typical meeting end That productive let meet next Tuesday continue But Sprint Week limited amount time drive sense urgency accomplish team ever believed could
Adding limited timeframe intense yet friendly competition
Each team receives different business concept yet one get funded end week
While give mark showmanship great story sensational way team attempted prove idea best distributing branded visit contract Sprint Week deck team go great length stand
There abundance discussion value team I attempt repeat
Instead I share choose staff team way
At end Sprint Week Partners ultimately responsible selecting business concept invest
In order balance dynamic process Partner placed different team
They act decider significant decision direct workstreams ultimately gain conviction necessary persuade Investment Committee progress kill concept
Each team staffed one person critical function software business product design business analyst
We believe every member team Design series intentional choice design every aspect business product strategy hiring plan pricing
Every single member team participates regardless function opportunity use skill posse one use day job
Finally seed team expert buyer user business advisor others whose unique insight may help shape business concept
We believe getting critique early often bringing guest one way architect type feedback
Sprint Week become mainstay High Alpha one step innovation process
Before Sprint Week team spends month researching framing problem statement narrowing compete sprint
After Sprint Partners deliberate decide concept launched next studio company
For work accomplished Sprint sole purpose establish necessary conviction launch new software business
The work refining product getting hand customer scaling business still lie ahead u
And embrace new challenge way embraced old one bias toward action

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Mid sprint demo seems popular practice among scrum team I struggle see fit high performing team
Two set question
demo part Scrum framework likely unarticulated process problem
Instead ask What problem trying solve demo
If neither stakeholder Scrum Team readily identify underlying problem I listed quite common issue might lead team applying kind Scrum
demo
The say emphasis mine A Sprint Review held inspect Increment adapt Product Backlog needed
Soliciting feedback increment make sense especially since many vertical slice story may yet done within current Sprint
In addition demo would unable meaningfully demonstrate completion value Sprint Goal
A demo project smell generally indicating organization trying use additional demo comprehensive project control
Some reason company might make mistake include Consider shortening Sprint length one two week enable tighter feedback loop
Shorter iteration provide stakeholder opportunity inspect process iteratively refine product cost higher framework overhead
Consider working closely stakeholder story writing development acceptance testing criterion vertical slice functionality
Remember user story specification placeholder conversation story value consumer
Consider increasing level engagement Product Owner Development Team Sprint Planning
Also consider increasing level engagement stakeholder Scrum Team Backlog Refinement
Perhaps important Stakeholders always participate Sprint Reviews discussion Product Owner content Product Backlog
The Product Owner follow every Sprint Review refinement Product Backlog reflects reaction feedback provided stakeholder
User story adequately specify must benefit story granular enough properly identify value completed story provide often lead building wrong thing
Consider refining decomposing user story better
This closely related building wrong thing
Agile process often work best everyone agrees goal
Consider making creation testable acceptance criterion Cucumber test example part definition done story
Make sure work stakeholder write test start working feature order make sure everyone agrees right thing finished
There certainly reason
Your best bet
What problem trying solve demo
reasonable question immediately improve communication help Scrum Team organization address issue
By posting answer agree

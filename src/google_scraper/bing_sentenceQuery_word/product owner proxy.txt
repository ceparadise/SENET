I learning Scrum currently basic knowledge
I question role Product Owner Scrum process The Product Owner active role daily meeting Scrum
listen get sense going team commitment
The Product Owner remain background meeting speak
If Product Owner grave concern take Scrum Master meeting
If Product Owner present possible get asked clarification story
Even postponed meeting order avoid draw discussion
If actual customer ca present often enough take role Product Owner proxy nominated
The important characteristic proxy Especially second point usually mean proxy must either senior developer someone management circle
I familiar term External Stakeholders Engagement term used Scrum I ca say definitively relates Product Owner first glance aim seems
I going answer question slightly different order asked since I think help build answer
Product Owner person customer
A team member nominated proxy product owner
A Product Owner customer simply representative stakeholder authority make decision priority work Product Backlog
The Product Owner technical position
It business position
The person Product Owner role need understand customer need
After primary function write prioritize Product Backlog Items answer question coordinate stakeholder review incremental delivery ensure meet need user intended environment
One piece guidance Scrum Master Product Owner person see info
Those role odds
The Product Owner responsible driving business need Scrum Master responsible team
Sometimes need business odds need team
What role Product Owner daily Scrum part meeting
There nothing prevents Product Owner attending Daily Scrum meeting
The Daily Scrum opportunity Development Team around day activity Scrum Master coordinate team issue need resolved slow development
There much Product Owner meeting though observe team
The Scrum Master ensures people outside Development Team attend Daily Scrum disrupt Development Team process meeting
The time immediately following Daily Scrum used discussion among Development Team member adjust plan Sprint
People outside Development Team participate activity
Can say Project Manager directly interacts customer nominated proxy Product Owner
There direct mapping traditional Project Manager role Scrum
I would agree customer interaction aspect Project Manager role map Product Owner role
However aspect Project Manager role managing schedule budget Scrum Master function
Other project management function like estimating managing risk internal communication belong entire Development Team
When use term External Stakeholders Engagement referring Product Owner something else
Most likely Product Owner yes
The Product Owner person speaks behalf customer user software developed
The Product Owner need understand need able write user story answer team question user story arise prioritize Product Backlog
The Product Owner expected know everything manage communication outside world
If answer know engage get answer development team
The product owner always proxy customer
They could actual customer representative reason must
In fact good reason product owner customer
The product owner responsible distilling need customer story customer
Being good product owner requires skill typical customer likely
I would argue product owner never developer product owner job right
It easily full time job worst half time job
If nominate developer product owner development activity cut half
The product owner active role active role process overall
There continual dialog development team product owner
It standups specifically dev team communicating within progress toward sprint goal nothing
The daily standup short strictly keeping everyone informed well team toward sprint goal
It time ask clarification though time raise fact clarification necessary
Once standup time team interact product owner
As question external stakeholder people directly involved development product
They developer product owner anyone else interest product developed
A marketing team example might external stakeholder
It responsibility product owner communicate information product team ready benefit provides customer etc
I would argue link product owner customer explicit suggested answer
The product owner ultimately decides top backlog thus implemented product
It would good thing would mapping customer request often one reason many shop screw scrum
The product owner take account long term interest product could mean No
We give something different later helpful
The product perish customer recognize need
But likely become irrelevant product owner thinking passing latest request field
The product owner primarily represent customer represents success product

Our agile Product Owner responsible establishing team
As product grow size add stakeholder mix solution grows need across broader organization
Scaling Product Owner role fundamental problem trying solve talk scaling agile
Once get larger company departmental IT initiative Product Owner becomes responsible deciding build assessing requirement interested balancing often competing deciding go product
The Product Owner might ultimate say longer person influence direction product
Other folk get weigh
To get visual type organization I talking might consider small software shop last post
Their product taken stakeholder list grown include group investor sale marketing team training support organization diverse user community
Lots people opinion direction take spending money make happen
Faced increasing external complexity Product Owner spend time managing expectation customer business
Because Product Owner trying understand manage demand diverse set stakeholder often lose ability work closely team
When happens team loses team start work based best guess important
The Product Owner longer driving development deferred responsibility team
This probably one worst place agile team find
The relationship Product Owner Team broken
We need way repair situation keep team building right software
The stakeholder going continue put demand Product Owner time attention availability going continue risk
Often solution insert Business Analyst Project Manager even senior developer Product Owner
This division labor becomes necessary job gotten big single person perform role
The real Product Owner focus customer stakeholder day day interaction team delegated proxy
As mentioned last post alluded Product Owner proxy keep team moving ultimately degrade accountability Product Owner emerging solution degrade quality information available team
Unless proxy truly empowered make binding decision behalf Product Owner I big fan approach
More often proxy NOT Single Wringable Neck
You hold accountable unless get really decide happens product accountability going break defer real owner every time
Someone team empowered set must without getting DONE get nearly impossible
How many team backlog completed feature waiting Product Owner accept
Believe real problem many team
We need better solution absolute insistence single Product Owner even proxy

Hi Mike Great post I planning using one diagram image LinkedIn group I creating would ok
Best Aaron FOLLOW

All often product manager opt Product Owner
They conspire business product analyst proxy product owner
Of course since book course regarding Product Owner appendage Scrum Team
All write user story play planning poker INVEST
These manifestation Product Owner come developer defining Product Owner
Scrum define use Product Backlog Product Owner
Yet I know someone writing perfect user story using Scrum optimize job product management
They become business analyst requirement engineer
Delegation product owner responsibility continues deep divide development customer
My concept Scrum Master going bridge divide
The Scrum Master would teach business agile fulfilling role Product Owner
The Scrum Master going help PO understand take advantage opportunity optimize value collaborate team
In way I envision Product Owner becoming business analyst responsible requirement engineering
Scrum driven software development community
I think cause u see Product Owner eye
What help u better
We seen eye responsible product thinking development collaborate PO help job better
The people Product Management customer caught
They realized want help u work
They fled leaving behind largely eviscerated Product Owner position Product Analyst
Of course simply reinforces waterfall someone developer person charge product use
The Product Owner Scrum Master
They clear interest habit
Changing individual habit hard
Changing see point view impossible
They first learn new way job agility
I going try remedy problem new product owner course purely focus Product Manager agile
using Scrum iterative incremental technique point agile value driven opportunistic sit around write user story
Ken With due respect really need another course
How updating CSPO course
There CSPO course
There many course created provider taken Mike course changed
They focus user story poker invest kano analysis
So CSPO umbrella set course provides certification attending
Useless
That way harsh
Mike I created initial CSPO course address need needed someone make Product Backlog work
That good
However law unintended consequence undercut connection needed product manager real customer
Working product backlog requirement gathering started losing person want agility
Ken Ken It reality evolution started taking root practice
Your post observation great mention root cause problem
With limited experience observation lead root cause lack real PO organization
In large organization ratio real PO someone actually view vision product v engineer thing around
So form team POs scale demand team
Hence community started falling back onto business analyst architect fill void
I look forward hearing comment Hey rkochath The idea one Chief Product Owner Aea Product Owners one per area scale ratio mentioned
Product Owners need prioritize backlog make sure backlog item clarified
The clarification necessarily done Product Owner
If Product Owner outward focusing well inward focused well continue handed work real product management explicit implicit contract run blame nuisance come
Cheers good posting nice article site give interesting information
Thanks sharing I share concern Ken
I curious
What make think course better PO agile value driven etc going convince business allocate budget full time truly empowered Product Management PO
What software team send Business Analyst PO course
Does really help situation substantially
I think might also help case study demonstrating ROI
That might actually inspire business invest truly empowered
Anyway thought
Excellent thought
That might rally
I concerned turn product manager want agile instead learn user story
Also I engagement organization want agile I want something directs product manager customer toward agility requirement engineering
Ken I think making wild assumption business analyst requirement monkey
This true within UK business analyst mostly work holistically across many business component one IT solution
In applying service system lean thinking soft system methodology
BA UK complete diploma BA British Computer Society trained look beyond IT solve business problem
This training lends neatly critical friend product owner becoming product owner especially PO training I see cover half
Saying I think situation chose BA PO
BAs may go become business architect lead business agility
Additionally many BAs come IT background natural flare big picture
This mean also operate within development team
One last point IT project deliver product
In fact I would say deliver service outcome customer business
Product management might work well company selling product others trying achieve efficiency internal business change turning oil tanker respond new market
They need business analysis product owner
Busness analysis matured since system analyst role
The training offered also matured continuing develop
From I sit Product Owner trying develop BA skill training BAs past year UK BA I speak country
want research paper proxy product owner
proxy product owner good bad ugly
kindly help Sidra summary product owner one role done committee
If one person commit PO role project risk
Due sense someone PO role part time
proxy PO
Instead BA support PO become PO half way house
So Proxy PO role exist bad
At end day scrum tried hard simplify role condense PO Scrum master team
Is really hard get role right
You may find following useful
blog called BA Support Product Owner http also new book published Feb called Agile Business Analysis
The BA poor replacement customer PO part business desire change produce business valuable
Ken Interesting thought Ken
This new Product Owner course interesting see
Great initiative
Having consistent course Scrum role important
One gap already filled PSD
Welcome good introduction role Product Owner crucial probable least implemented one
Leading deficiency touch article
And rightfully remind u Business Involvement crucial build software use sell real user pay management expects return
One classification expert routine expert adaptive expert
The US army starting adaptable leader program trying adopt design thinking leadership
It would interesting see bit recognising PO program
I think important address gap developer business also described hi simple scrum master
working great avionic french company put place agile organization create new information system
propose put place product owner proxy place product owner user become product owner place stakeholder goal involve user new model organization think corrupt Scrum plan
thanks help best regard Frederic You watch consequence
Inspect adapt
Come zuehlke Product Owner course end February Zurich see understand
Ken Does necessarily corrupt
See work
The purpose get customer think agility
Ken I completely agree dangerous PO become glorified requirement manager proxy product management
All often I see POs actual product responsibility prioritise backlog write user story based product definition handed product manager sitting somewhere else marketing department strategy department wherever
To completely defeat purpose guy actual product vision often aloof sits away team full benefit agile come whole product team work think iteratively
Agile product team continues think term release
The PO scrum team voice product agile thinker

Thing product owner need training good PO
Or understand WHY

Stop lazy giving responsibility team especially Scrum Master becomes proxy
Start open Scrum try understand ask endless question make sense
This experience year scrum practice
A good PO
Knows product
Decides quickly
Has good relation team Greeting Vietnam

Pingback I see concern Ken
The question though one person customer also available team
I seen In company combo Product Manager Proxy Product Onwer actually work well super allingned
In case actually bad split strong PMs prefer strategy prefer working close team
If Product Manager work closely identify high level business goal empowers take create backlog work
every day team PM flexibility travel see customer still come Sprint Demos
The goal PO maximize benefit development activity
To need infuse team idea goal context
They team aware business marketplace
It turn team member sterile part business consumer marketplace also
The PO great good long rambling discussion team PO intention goal
And else fails PO reset Sprint Review
Ken Ken Part problem role Product Owner defined
When I coach team I define Product Owner someone owns small business small bit money want something order survive
That drive backlog story priority
And coach write story bring home money release go every Sprint something akin Lean Startup
The ambiguity role definition potentially causing problem therefore solve
Sri The ambiguity purposeful leaving solution open creativity
The responsibility accountability open ambiguity directed
Thanks Ken I look forward new PO Agility course understand approach
Good luck
Proxy Product Owner Proxy Husband Pingback Dear Ken Above sound really great challenging
The following come mind though A Product Owner Proxy always focus value feature story bring
In multiple company experienced building new software solution replace existing solution
From user perspective value come functionality back one place
So releasing different feature story may always bring direct value end user perspective
What experience case keep moving forward deliver sprint still steer value
Thanks Saša Other type value change order Product Backlog
Removing technical debt software readily changed support agility

Critical infrastructure architecture item always one function included prove invisible item work
Removal risk Best Ken Thanks Ken From experience advice guide Agile project focus building version specific software solution
Cheers Saša In finance industry industry probably well many system serving internal customer multiple department
sale risk controlling reporting etc
Decisions regarding functionality system typically made dept

Additionally could conflict maximizing value department maximizing value whole organization
In many organization BA IT department chosen product owner moderate stakeholder
What would advice selecting efficient effective PO environment

framework managing work emphasis
It designed team three nine developer break work action completed within timeboxed iteration called typically track progress called
Approaches coordinating work multiple scrum team larger organization include among others
Scrum iterative incremental framework managing product development
It defines flexible product development strategy development team work unit reach common goal challenge assumption traditional sequential approach product development enables team encouraging physical close online collaboration team member well daily communication among team member discipline involved
A key principle Scrum dual recognition customer change mind want need often called requirement volatility unpredictable predictive planned approach suited
As Scrum adopts problem fully understood defined front instead focusing maximize team ability deliver quickly respond emerging requirement adapt evolving technology change market condition
Many term used Scrum scrum master typically written leading capital Scrum Master conjoint word written ScrumMaster
To maintain encyclopedic tone however article us normal sentence case recognized mark
This occasionally seen written SCRUM
The word correct however likely arose due early paper Ken Schwaber capitalized SCRUM title
While term Scrum allowed lapse deemed owned wider community rather individual leading capital used word
Hirotaka Takeuchi introduced term scrum context article New New Product Development Game
Takeuchi Nonaka later argued The Knowledge Creating Company form organizational knowledge creation especially good bringing innovation continuously incrementally spirally
The author described new approach commercial product development would increase speed flexibility based case study manufacturing firm automotive photocopier printer
They called approach whole process performed one across multiple overlapping phase team try go distance unit passing ball back forth
In used restart play forward team interlock head attempt gain possession ball
In early used would become Scrum company Advanced Development Methods John Scumniotales Jeff McKenna developed similar approach Easel Corporation referring using single word Scrum
In Sutherland Schwaber jointly presented paper describing Scrum framework Business Object Design Implementation Workshop held part OOPSLA Austin Texas
Over following year Schwaber Sutherland collaborated combine experience evolving good develop became known Scrum
In Schwaber worked Mike Beedle describe method book
Scrum approach planning managing product development involves bringing authority level operation property certainty
In Schwaber others founded Scrum Alliance set accreditation series
Schwaber left Scrum Alliance late founded oversees parallel accreditation series
Since public document called defines sort official version Scrum occasionally revised
There three core role Scrum framework
These ideally deliver potentially shippable product increment every sprint
Together three role form scrum team
While many organization role involved defining delivering product Scrum defines three
The product owner represents product accountable ensuring team delivers value business
The product owner defines product term typically add based importance dependency
Scrum team one product owner
This role combined scrum master
The product owner focus business side product development spend majority time liaising stakeholder dictate team reach technical solution
This role equivalent role agile framework XP
Communication core responsibility product owner
The ability convey priority empathize team member stakeholder vital steer product development right direction
The product owner role bridge communication gap team stakeholder serving proxy stakeholder team team representative overall stakeholder community
As face team stakeholder following communication task product owner stakeholder Empathy key attribute product owner ability put one self another shoe
A product owner converse different stakeholder variety background job role objective
A product owner must able see different point view
To effective wise product owner know level detail audience need
The development team need thorough feedback specification build product expectation executive sponsor may need summary progress
Providing information necessary may lose stakeholder interest waste time
A direct mean communication preferred seasoned agile product owner
A product owner ability communicate effectively also enhanced skilled technique identify stakeholder need negotiate priority stakeholder interest collaborate developer ensure effective implementation requirement
The development team responsible delivering potentially shippable product increment every sprint sprint goal
The team three nine member carry task required build product increment analysis design development testing technical writing etc
Although several discipline represented team member referred generically
To avoid potential confusion refers programmer organization call member
The development team Scrum even though may interaction role outside team PMO
Scrum facilitated scrum master accountable removing impediment ability team deliver product goal deliverable
The scrum master traditional act buffer team distracting influence
The scrum master ensures Scrum framework followed
The scrum master help ensure team follows agreed process Scrum framework often facilitates key session encourages team improve
The role also referred team facilitator reinforce dual perspective
The core responsibility scrum master include limited One way scrum master role differs project manager latter may responsibility scrum master
Scrum formally recognise role project manager traditional command control tendency would cause difficulty
A sprint iteration basic unit development Scrum
The sprint effort restricted specific duration
The duration fixed advance sprint normally one week one month two week common
Each sprint start sprint planning event aim define sprint backlog identify work sprint make estimated forecast sprint goal
Each sprint end sprint review sprint retrospective review progress show stakeholder identify lesson improvement next sprint
Scrum emphasizes working product end sprint really done
In case software likely includes software fully integrated tested documented potentially shippable
At beginning sprint scrum team hold sprint planning event Each day sprint team hold daily scrum specific guideline Any impediment stumbling block risk issue delayed dependency assumption proved unfounded identified daily scrum captured scrum master displayed team scrum board shared risk board agreed person designated working toward resolution outside daily scrum
No detailed discussion happen daily scrum
At end sprint team hold two event sprint review sprint retrospective
At sprint review team Guidelines sprint review At sprint retrospective team Guidelines sprint retrospective The following activity commonly done although considered core part Scrum Backlog refinement called backlog grooming ongoing process reviewing product backlog item checking appropriately prioritised prepared way make clear executable team enter sprint via sprint planning activity
Product backlog item may broken multiple smaller one acceptance criterion may clarified dependency investigation preparatory work may identified agreed technical spike
Although originally core Scrum practice backlog refinement added scrum guide adopted way managing quality product backlog item entering sprint recommended investment team sprint capacity
The backlog also include technical debt also known design debt code debt
This concept software development reflects implied cost additional rework caused choosing easy solution instead using better approach would take longer
The product owner cancel sprint necessary
The product owner may input team scrum master management
For instance management may wish product owner cancel sprint external circumstance negate value sprint goal
If sprint abnormally terminated next step conduct new sprint planning reason termination reviewed
The product backlog comprises ordered list scrum team maintains
It consists must done successfully deliver viable product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item PBIs based consideration risk business value dependency size date needed
Items added backlog commonly written story format
The product backlog delivered ordered sequence delivered
It visible everyone may changed consent product owner ultimately responsible ordering product backlog item development team choose
The product backlog contains product owner assessment business value development team assessment development effort often always stated using
These estimate help product owner gauge timeline may influence ordering product backlog item example two feature business value product owner may schedule earlier delivery one lower development effort higher one higher development effort complex riskier want retire risk earlier
The product backlog business value product backlog item responsibility product owner
The size
estimated complexity effort item however determined development team contributes sizing story point estimated hour
There common misunderstanding allowed product backlog
By contrast Scrum neutral requirement technique
As Scrum primer state product backlog item articulated way clear sustainable
Contrary popular misunderstanding product backlog contain user story simply contains item
Those item expressed user story requirement approach group find useful
But whatever approach item focus delivering value customer
Scrum advocate role product owner assigned
The product owner responsible maximizing value product
The product owner gather input take feedback lobbied many people ultimately make call get built
The product backlog Typically product owner scrum team come together write everything must prioritized becomes content first block time meant focused work selected item accommodated within timeframe
The product backlog evolve new information surface product customer later sprint may address new work
The following item typically comprise product backlog feature bug technical work knowledge acquisition
A feature wanted bug unintended unwanted may necessarily something defective
An example technical work could run virus check developer workstation
An example knowledge acquisition could research Wordpress plugin library making selection
A product backlog simplest form merely list item work
Having rule work added removed ordered help whole team make better decision change product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item based needed soonest
The team chooses item complete coming sprint
On scrum board team move item product backlog sprint backlog list item build
Conceptually ideal team select think accomplish top list unusual see practice team able take item list along top one selected
This normally happens time left within sprint accommodate work
Items top backlog item work first broken story suitable development team work
The backlog go le refined item
As Schwaber Beedle put The lower priority le detail barely make backlog item
As team work backlog must assumed change happens outside team learn new market opportunity take advantage competitor threat arise feedback customer change way product meant work
All new idea tend trigger team adapt backlog incorporate new knowledge
This part fundamental mindset agile team
The world change backlog never finished
The sprint backlog list work development team must address next sprint
The list derived scrum team progressively selecting product backlog item priority order top product backlog feel enough work fill sprint
The development team keep mind past performance assessing capacity new sprint use guide line much complete
The product backlog item may broken task development team
Tasks sprint backlog never assigned rather task signed team member needed according set priority skill team
This promotes development team developer
The sprint backlog property development team included estimate provided development team
Often accompanying task board used see change state task current sprint like progress done
Once sprint backlog committed additional work added sprint backlog except team
Once sprint delivered product backlog analyzed reprioritized necessary next set functionality selected next sprint
The increment potentially shippable increment PSI sum product backlog item completed sprint integrated work previous sprint
At end sprint increment must complete according scrum team definition done DoD fully functioning usable condition regardless whether product owner decides actually release
The following artifact commonly used although considered core part Scrum The sprint chart public displayed chart showing remaining work sprint backlog
Updated every day give simple view sprint progress
It also provides quick visualization reference
The horizontal axis sprint chart show day sprint vertical axis show amount work remaining day typically representing estimate hour work remaining
During sprint planning ideal burndown chart plotted
Then sprint member pick task sprint backlog work
At end day update remaining hour task completed
In way actual burndown chart updated day day
It confused
The release chart way team provide visibility track progress toward release
Updated end sprint show progress toward delivering forecast scope
The horizontal axis release chart show sprint release vertical axis show amount work completed end sprint typically representing cumulative story point work completed
Progress plotted line grows meet horizontal line represents forecast scope often shown forecast based progress date indicates much scope might completed given release date many sprint take complete given scope
The release chart make easy see much work completed much work added removed horizontal scope line move much work left done
The determine whether product backlog item complete
In many case DoD requires successful
The definition done may vary one scrum team another must consistent within one team
The total effort team capable sprint
The number derived evaluating work typically point completed last sprint
The collection historical velocity data guideline assisting team understanding much work likely achieve future sprint
A period used research concept create simple prototype
Spikes either planned take place sprint larger team spike might accepted one many sprint delivery objective
Spikes often introduced delivery large complex product backlog item order secure budget expand knowledge produce proof concept
The duration objective spike agreed product owner development team start
Unlike sprint commitment spike may may deliver tangible shippable valuable functionality
For example objective spike might successfully reach decision course action
The spike time necessarily objective delivered
Also called drone spike tracer bullet spike current architecture current technology set current set best practice result production quality code
It might narrow implementation functionality throwaway code
It production quality rest iteration build code
The name military origin make path bullet visible allowing correction
Often implementation shot layer application connecting single form input field prove layer connect expected
Scrum work le well following circumstance From business perspective Scrum many virtue one designed yield best business solution
However efficiency given organization vary widely largely dependent ability organization adhere implementation guideline article
Every company distinct organizational structure culture set business practice naturally amenable methodology others
Like agile method effective adoption Scrum supported wide range tool
Many company use universal tool spreadsheet build maintain artifact sprint backlog
There also proprietary software package either dedicated product development using Scrum framework support multiple product development approach including Scrum
Other organization implement Scrum without software tool maintain artifact form paper whiteboards sticky note
Scrum empirical approach like empirical process control underpinned three pillar transparency inspection adaptation
All work within Scrum framework visible responsible outcome process workflow progress etc
In order make thing visible scrum team need frequently inspect product developed well team working
With frequent inspection team spot work deviate outside acceptable limit adapt process product development
These three pillar require trust openness team following five value Scrum enable The hybridization Scrum software development methodology common Scrum cover whole therefore organization find need add additional process create comprehensive implementation
For example start product development organization commonly add process guidance business case requirement gathering prioritization initial design budget schedule forecasting
Various author community people use Scrum also suggested detailed technique apply adapt Scrum particular problem organization
Many refer methodological technique analogy architecture software
Such pattern extended Scrum outside software development domain Manufacturing Finance
Scrumban software production model based Scrum
Scrumban especially suited frequent unexpected work item programming error
In case sprint Scrum framework may perceived le benefit although Scrum daily event practice still applied depending team situation hand
Visualization work stage limitation simultaneous unfinished work defect familiar Kanban model
Using method team directed way allows minimum completion time work item programming error hand ensures team member constantly employed
To illustrate stage work team working space often use note large whiteboard
In case decentralized team software
The major difference Scrum Kanban Scrum work divided sprint last fixed amount time whereas Kanban flow work continuous
This visible work stage table Scrum emptied sprint whereas Kanban task marked table
Scrum focus team multifaceted whereas Kanban make specialized functional team possible
The scrum scrum technique operate Scrum scale multiple team working product allowing discus progress interdependency focusing coordinate delivering software especially area overlap integration
Depending cadence timing scrum scrum relevant daily scrum scrum team end designating one member ambassador participate scrum scrum ambassador team
Depending context ambassador may technical contributor team scrum master
Rather simply progress update scrum scrum focus team collectively working resolve mitigate accept risk impediment dependency assumption RIDAs identified
The scrum scrum track RIDAs via backlog risk board sometimes known initial resolved owned accepted mitigated typically lead greater coordination collaboration team
This run similar daily scrum ambassador answering following four question As commented Since I originally defined Scrum Scrums Ken Schwaber IDX working I definitively say Scrum Scrums meta Scrum
The Scrum Scrums I used responsible delivering working software team Definition Done end sprint release sprint
PatientKeeper delivered production four time per Sprint
delivers production time per Sprint
Hubspot delivers live software time day
The Scrum Scrums Master held accountable making work
So Scrum Scrums operational delivery mechanism
scrum LeSS product development framework extends Scrum scaling rule guideline without losing original purpose Scrum
There two level framework first LeSS level designed team second level known LeSS Huge introduces additional scaling element development hundred developer
Scaling Scrum start understanding able adopt standard real Scrum
Scrum requires examining purpose Scrum element figuring reach purpose staying within constraint standard Scrum rule
Bas Vodde evolved LeSS framework experience working product development especially telecom finance industry
It evolved taking Scrum trying many different experiment discover work
In experiment solidified LeSS framework rule
The intention LeSS descale organization complexity dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solution solving simpler way
Less role le management le organizational structure

Main content start
Sign follow author For first post Pulse I thought I would tackle topic fraught danger Product Owner Proxies
Sometimes business unwilling unable provide Scrum Product Owner PO really fulfill requirement role
In experience usually business appoints someone Product Owner without understanding commitment level required fill role Scrum Team find either directionless problem Product Owner available
In particular case Product Owner Proxy added team help redirect guide need team
Let quickly review Product Owners
The Product Owner need bring customer business need team effectively build product
This includes understanding customer need working customer differentiate must like understand product market answer question team guide work
In case direct customer need understand market determine feature benefit end user
They bring team team brings
The main reason select Proxy regular Product Owner unable meet team regular basis daily stand ups etc
need present planning
Proxies fill hole available accessible
If selecting Proxy person wo able fulfill requirement pick different Proxy
Ideally Proxy physically team entire team remote need heavily connected team Skype instant messaging cell phone etc
The Proxy difficult role fill many Proxies find lot work
They need understand backlog item product well enough answer question team keep team track Product Owner unavailable
They need connected Product Owner regular basis understand shifting priority nuance need
They need able answer question Why backlog item ranked others
What customer need next
This mean need know much market customer PO daily basis need understand enough answer question team
One good rule thumb Proxy communicating Product Owner least day
This especially true something come may blocker may impact work sprint
Otherwise conversation may sufficient
If organization requires Proxy likely Product Owner attending meeting absolutely required attend meeting planning review ideally retrospective
This mean Proxy need attend plus daily meeting hear team accomplished yesterday plan work today blocker exist
The Proxy answer question arise ensure team working highest priority item sprint work ScrumMaster remove impediment
The Proxy need afraid ask question go back Product Owner question need information
They conduit Product Owner team Scrum relies open transparent communication
The PO need know Proxy uncomfortable making call lack information necessary guide team
Sometimes priority need change Proxy communicating team make sure team effort aligned Product Owner priority
Additionally Proxy need escalate back Product Owner issue blocker problem arise team
Another caution around time management
Being Proxy similar Product Owner
Most trainer tell good Product Owner pretty much job
Same thing Proxies
It possible team Proxy could cover two team best team working similar work
Ideally Proxies cover single delivery team
ScrumMasters check periodically Product Owner make sure aware issue come ensure Proxy PO sync
Open transparent communication Scrum
You want surprised Sprint Review team delivered Product Owner want
Additionally many Product Owners additional authority Proxies lack helpful escalating issue require remediation
I personally Proxy several project past
It demanding role Proxy Product Owner good understanding team product need deliver good partnership role rewarding
Scrum team looking add Proxy absolutely necessary work work well
Do experience Product Owner Proxies

current market global economic strategic need
Building Agile Offshore team across boundary time zone different ball game
It fair share challenge work
I shared challenge possible approach take earlier article



You need make change along way normal routine make work
One challenge I often see integration offshore team onshore team vision
You could address making people travel meet face face video conferencing etc
Your Product Owner may flexible take part every daily core hour ready stretch time
Let assume still business representative disposal inhibitor offshore team success
How address
This also big risk team may lead miscommunication
There could instance PO proxy may aware big picture hence unable answer team question authority
address
Scrum team must meeting part scrum ceremony
In session entire team product owner proxy product owner come together discus new upcoming requirement product backlog
This give offshore team hear connect actual product owner directly
Going Proxy PO risk
It add another extra layer decision making ideal
I favor going proxy PO
Additionally business person offshore side help vision also make wonder offshore team
Offshore team work rather implementation partner
Tagged read You seem addressing common issue team facing Agile implementation
Talking specifically Product Owner collocated team I would like share experience project overcame remote Product Owner problem
In first project Agile transformation project world largest logistics client started training business SMEs Product Owners
We started basic training got story writing workshop
These future Product Owners joined Business Analysts development team India become proxy Product Owners project
Pretty similar mentioned article
The Proxy Product Owners would act bridge development team India Product Owners SMEs US
The proxy POs added responsibility conducting backlog grooming session POs also writing user story

Thanks sharing thought
They great idea good see tried successfully
Backlog grooming important entire team help planning also give entire team interact directly PO elusive sprint planning
Good info Avienaash
In previous team faced similar situation product owner client
He busy business engagement able devote much time address team query
We implemented solution creating Issue Log query Scrum Master I took lead meeting twice week PO discus issue
Having said I personally believe PO important role scrum process
Business must understand importance role
Having part time PO Proxy PO solve real problem
Agree
Having Proxy PO workaround situation
Clients need understand important share time people money
I know I late still thought harm sharing view
I agree face proxy product owner look like viable option give good result said I feel add extra layer information might lost transition interpreted differently
More sometimes proxy product owner decision making authority delay proceeding
Also proxy might create mind set product owner always required someone take care behalf might take away opportunity offshore team member meet product owner
I would rather push weekly backlog grooming meeting via video conference possible long hour hour half Leave Comment trackback Previous post Next post Get smart DIYthemes

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I interested understanding agile project management differs single team digital agency software development consulting firm
For starter situation consulting firm agency multiple client Client Product Owner
The primary role product owner represent need desire stakeholder community agile delivery team A secondary role product owner represent work agile team stakeholder community Whoever well good Product Owner
As CodeGnome pointed effective Product Owner integral part Scrum team
We tried approach client case internal client playing role Product Owner part time
It effective
When brought person Product Owner change dramatic
I n situation consulting firm agency multiple client Client Product Owner
No fundamentally different role
While Product Owner come client Product Owner specific role within Scrum framework
The client stakeholder chicken Product Owner formal member Scrum team pig
The client perhaps axiomatically stakeholder process
An individual steering committee within client organization designated project sponsor course client responsible funding project
However Scrum assigns Product Owner role proxy stakeholder regard prioritization scheduling
The Product Owner work stakeholder create Product Backlog build stakeholder consensus project priority resource allocation
As defined role Scrum process Product Owner must active participant project simply stakeholder waiting feature delivered
In practice Product Owner need integral part Scrum team
As generally beneficial Product Owner member organization Scrum Master developer
In way stakeholder proxy role properly situated project
Larger client often PMO project management framework client may provide internal manager stakeholder proxy project
In case two proxy coordinate client internal proxy represents client Product Owner Product Owner facilitates client interest within Scrum team
For product one person care enough product champion either provide budget develop arrange budget provided
That person Product Owner occasionally team rather single person
Everyone else whether internal external agency proxy Product Owner regardless role title may awarded
In addition Product Owner likely stakeholder whose need met product go live
Users great example wo like product hard use may also include advertiser auditor legal staff architect etc
In situation sometimes proxy Product Owner may effective PO may greater awareness gatekeeping stakeholder
I would expect case software consultancy specialises particular domain example Telecoms Commodity Trading Banking Retail hotel set stakeholder
It likely PO client within staff client gatekeeping stakeholder
By posting answer agree

April Pichler Consulting Limited Product owner play key part creating successful product Scrum They charge product lead development effort
But new role challenging apply
For many organization path effective product ownership littered trap pitfall
This article help recognize avoid common trap
InformIT The Product Owner one person responsible managing Product Backlog ensuring value work team performs
This person maintains Product Backlog ensures visible everyone writes Ken Schwaber Scrum Guide Feb edition
This definition sound rather harmless consider implication
It requires product owner lead product discovery help identify describe requirement make sure product backlog ready next sprint planning meeting
It also mean product owner engage product planning visioning product road mapping
The individual decides content release carry release planning review work result provides feedback team manages customer user stakeholder
So many diverse responsibility make product owner challenging role
What product owner duty often cut across existing role including product marketer product manager project manager role
It surprising organization find challenging apply new role encountering trap pitfall along way
Let look common one
A project underpowered product owner much like car underpowered engine The car run struggle going get tough
An underpowered product owner lack empowerment
There may several cause The product owner enough management attention sponsorship come wrong level wrong person management fully trust product owner find difficult delegate authority
As consequence product owner struggle effective job instance align Scrum team stakeholder customer exclude requirement release
A product owner development project I worked instance consult bos head line business every major decision
Not surprisingly caused delay eroded team confidence product owner
Ensure product owner fully empowered receives support trust right person
Being overworked unhealthy unsustainable personal level overworked product owner quickly become bottleneck limit project progress
Symptoms overworked product owner include neglecting product backlog grooming missing sprint planning review meeting available question giving answer long delay
Overworked product owner odds Agile Manifesto concept sustainable pace
Agile process promote sustainable development
The sponsor developer user able maintain constant pace There two main cause product owner overburden enough time perform role enough support team
Availability tends issue product owner role one many job competing time attention product owner look many product team
Not enough support team rooted wrong understanding product ownership Even though one product owner product owner work carried collaboratively
The team ScrumMaster must support product owner
To avoid overworked product owner try following First free individual responsibility
Start assumption product owner job one product owner look one product one team
Second ensure team make time every sprint collaborate product owner
Scrum allocates team capacity every sprint supporting product owner Schwaber
Not collaboration spread work across many shoulder also leverage team collective knowledge creativity
Some organization split product owner role distribute duty across several people instance employing product manager product The product manager take care product marketing product management aspect owns vision keep touch market
The product owner drive sprint work team
In case product owner little product backlog item writer
This approach reinforces old barrier blur responsibility authority cause handoff delay waste
Instead splitting product owner role organization face challenge applying role properly
One person charge strategic tactical product management aspect
This may well require organizational change including adapting job role career path developing individual take rich set responsibility
A distant product owner work separately team
Distance may evoke image globalized world product owner one continent team another
But distance come many form degree
It start working site different room end product owner team separated across continent time zone
I found recurring issue distant product owner including mistrust miscommunication misalignment slow progress
There reason The efficient effective method conveying information within development team Avoid distant product owner colocating Scrum team member
As mentioned earlier experienced significant productivity morale increase colocating product owner ScrumMaster team
If colocation option product owner spend much time possible room rest Scrum team
Remote product owner least sprint planning review retrospective meeting
Moving distant colocated product owner often take time
It may require hiring training local product owner
In case may also require rethinking company product strategy including company develops product
A proxy product owner person acting placeholder actual product owner
I found proxy product owner used compensate overworked partial distant product owner
At client mine vice president product management asked take product owner role product
Even though ideally suited job struggled spend enough time team
The business analyst team consequently stood proxy product owner real product owner could
The proxy product owner work without empowered
The actual product owner ultimately decided product backlog prioritization release planning whether accept reject work result
What followed increase conflict miscommunication slowdown decision making decrease productivity morale
Using proxy product owner attempt superficially treat systemic issue
Rather employing quick fix organization address underlying issue
This might require freeing product owner obligation colocating product owner ScrumMaster team even finding new product owner
A product owner committee group product owner without anyone charge overall product
There one person guiding group helping create common goal facilitating decision making
A product owner committee danger getting caught endless meeting conflicting interest also referred death No real progress achieved people stop collaborating start fighting
Always ensure one person charge product overall chief product owner guide product owner facilitates decision making including product backlog prioritization release planning
Applying product owner role effectively key developing successful product Scrum
It also learning process individual playing role organization
As making mistake part process expect apply role perfectly day one
But watch trap discussed
Ensure always one product owner responsible product organization
If one product owner required use product owner hierarchy chief product owner charge entire product
Make sure product owner empowered realistic workload work team onsite
This allow apply role effectively thereby increasing likelihood developing successful product

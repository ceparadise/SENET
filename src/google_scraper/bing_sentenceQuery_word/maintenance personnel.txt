Computer scientist study efficiently organize store retrieve data write efficient program probe limit algorithmic technique designing program behave intelligently develop new application benefit society humankind design complex software program design effective interface program human
At UALR Management Information Systems major focused development computer application business environment effective use computer resource meet business objective
Within college UALR Information Science IFSC program student primarily concerned learning structure representation management storage retrieval transfer information
Computer Science student focus deeply fundamental principle computing student develop skill data structure algorithmic reasoning hardware design need integrated software application design
We prepare student apply principle creatively responsibly
If unsure area interest suggest try introductory programming course
A common misconception among student attracted discipline learn skilled web page developer graphic specialist applicative user processing spreadsheet graphical design CAD application
If interest learning tool creation computer art art major minor CS Information Science would beneficial
If interest creating efficient software application including internetworking software application World Wide Web CS degree appropriate minor would best option
Please set visit talk u career interest design analysis development software system

The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution
If please discus UALR academic advisor answer question student transfer credit aspect student academic program study

modification software product delivery correct fault improve performance attribute
A common perception maintenance merely involves fixing
However one study indicated maintenance effort used action
This perception perpetuated user submitting problem report reality functionality enhancement system
More recent study put proportion closer
Software maintenance system first addressed
Over period twenty year research led formulation Lehman
Key finding research include maintenance really evolutionary development maintenance decision aided understanding happens system software time
Lehman demonstrated system continue evolve time
As evolve grow complex unless action taken reduce complexity
In late famous widely cited survey study Lientz Swanson exposed high fraction expended maintenance
They categorized maintenance activity four class The survey showed around maintenance effort first two type error correction consumed
Many subsequent study suggest similar magnitude problem
Studies show contribution end user crucial new requirement data gathering analysis
And main cause problem software evolution maintenance
So software maintenance important consumes large part overall lifecycle cost also inability change software quickly reliably mean business opportunity lost
An integral part software maintenance one requires accurate maintenance plan prepared software development
It specify user request modification report problem
The budget include resource cost estimate
A new decision addressed developing every new system feature quality objective
The software maintenance last year even decade development process call effective plan address scope software maintenance tailoring post process designation provide maintenance estimate cost
The selection proper enforcement standard challenging task right early stage software engineering got definite importance concerned stakeholder
This section describes six software maintenance process There number process activity practice unique maintainer example
Swanson initially identified three category maintenance corrective adaptive perfective
The standard superseded June
These since updated present There also notion maintenance good thing lower total cost ownership software
Things like compliance coding standard includes software maintainability goal
The management coupling cohesion software
The attainment software supportability goal SAE example
Note also academic institution carrying research quantify cost ongoing software maintenance due lack resource design document comprehension training resource multiply cost approx
design data available
Impact key adjustment factor maintenance sorted order maximum positive impact Not module troublesome many factor degrade performance
For example complex spaghetti code quite difficult maintain safely
A common situation often degrades performance lack suitable maintenance tool defect tracking software change management software test library software

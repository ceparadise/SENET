There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine
Perhaps need scroll right bit

I heard many term like Dynamic binding Static binding Dynamic linking Static linking Dynamic loading
All I know term vocabulary dynamic mean runtime
But Dynamic Static
According dictionary dynamic something keep changing Happen runtime equal Something keep changing
I see point people using dynamic mean Happen runtime
Dynamic linking program dynamically linked number shared library modify library main program provided change interface
So yes library might keep changing
An example upgrade Linux typically get new version many system library
Dynamic binding work programming language support dynamic binding function call bound function body dynamically based argument function called upon

It occurred today although I adopted infrequently use term semantics referring language element naming convention I sense formal definition
made eye glaze
I sense meaning context I encountered common usage respect linguistics I typically use term refer
This definition though idea
I major never taken Computer Science course
Is taught CS
Is accurate definition boiled statement two rather exhaustive exhausting article
A definition cribbed
This pretty much exactly inferred definition
The sticking point made eye glaze precisely defining model computation
There many different formal model computation lead different form semantics
Operational Semantics probably closest way people informally model semantics fragment code run interpreter changing state abstract routine
This approach break many model concurrency nondeterminism sematics better suited situation
It language element term formally mean term usually
This mean express term language effectively assuming underlying kind model depends semantic talking
As see wikipedia page mainly kind semantics From decription understand semantic something well defined inside context need specified context otherwise could give language formal definition term From perspective theory practice programming language language element semantics
Naming convention
And semantics nothing anything except perhaps implementation correct sometimes called faithful semantics
Beyond hard generalize many different style semantics
There style semantics called operational semantics given program semantics tell program executed abstract machine another variant semantics say program executed result
There axiomatic semantics roughly fact prove individiual program
The axiomatic semantics collection valid proof technique
It implementation ensure provable claim true
There also static semantics meant broadly requirement imposed compile time program considered good well formed
Stuff like variable defined used static semantics
But mostly people say static semantics mean type checking
Finally possible speak semantics abstract data type class interface among others
This usage good deal looser boil specification behavior permissible
I advise avoid word semantics context use word contract specification instead
It avoid confusing thing
Commentary always helpful try boil complex subject one two sentence
And come programming language
The Wikipedians mean well often complex confusing plain wrong

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
There different type error prevent computer program working way
Three key error type
Runtime error error cause program computer crash even appears nothing wrong program code
Running often cause runtime error
This could written wrong order
Syntax error mistake way code written
program syntactically correct
Common syntax error include spelling mistake incorrect use punctuation use capital letter
This piece code designed add two number together display result There four syntax error
Can identify
The syntax error The syntactically correct code would Semantic error logical error program work produce different result designed expected
A program semantic error without error reported
This code contains semantic error
The program run obvious problem see output result
The first two line ask user suggest number value
However function return data type
If user give value first second number stored string
When add two string together eg answer
Adding together produce answer
If try program valid program error work first time
However would notice unexpected result
The correct code would require value set
However integer need output string along rest outputted message
The correct code Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

In field concerned rigorous mathematical study meaning
It evaluating meaning legal defined specific programming language showing computation involved
In case evaluation would syntactically illegal string result would
Semantics describes process computer follows executing program specific language
This shown describing relationship input output program explanation program execute certain hence creating
Formal semantics instance help write compiler better understand program following statement effect alone
The field formal semantics encompasses following It close link area
There many approach formal semantics belong three major class The distinction three broad class approach sometimes vague known approach formal semantics use technique combination thereof
Apart choice denotational operational axiomatic approach variation formal semantic system arises choice supporting mathematical formalism
Some variation formal semantics include following For variety reason one might wish describe relationship different formal semantics
For example It also possible relate multiple semantics via theory

When internal working computer exposed possible damage computer static electricity held human body
Whenever casing computer opened internal working exposed change add memory chip example danger damaging computer buildup held human body
The internal working computer especially hard drive extremely susceptible static electricity cause considerable damage hard drive zapped even small amount
damage occur exposed static electricity low volt human able perceive static electricity reached volt
Walking across rug produce static electricity voltage volt static voltage life threatening
So possible damage hard drive static electricity even felt person low voltage
Also computer become increasingly susceptible static electricity damage circuitry built
Static electricity caused process called
Everything around u including u made atom every atom center nucleus positively charged proton neutron electrical charge
Surrounding atom negatively charged electron
The proton neutron atom change electron move one atom another
When two object touch exchange electron cause one object become electrically positive become electrically negative
When object touch another object either opposite neutral charge electron flow
Static electricity created electron move back forth atom
To avoid zapping component static electricity take precaution ground static electricity touching internal component computer
Wearing working mat prevent static electricity damaging computer
Another way ground static electricity touch internal metal frame computer case computer plugged electrical socket
The static electricity discharged grounded electrical circuit grounded via AC outlet
Also work PCs often consider using humidifier help control static electricity room work need stand carpet rug
Always handle electronic circuitry hard drive internal component insulated area insure send bolt static electricity coursing
An important exception rule working inside monitor
You ground working inside monitor
Monitors store electricity capacitor grounding provide conduit voltage discharge body
An older store enough electricity capacitor lethal released often ten thousand volt

Posted October Nicholas Zakas Tags Merge sort arguably first useful sorting algorithm learn computer science
Merge sort complexity O n log n making one efficient sorting algorithm available
Additionally merge sort stable sort like insertion sort relative order equivalent item remains sort
These advantage Firefox Safari use merge sort implementation
The algorithm merge sort based idea easier merge two already sorted list deal single unsorted list
To end merge sort start creating n number one item list n total number item original list sort
Then algorithm proceeds combine one item list back single sorted list
The merging two list already sorted pretty straightforward algorithm
Assume two list list A list B
You start front list compare two value
Whichever value smaller inserted result array
So suppose smaller value list A value placed result array
Next second value list A compared first value list B
Once smaller two value placed result list
So smaller value list B next step compare second item list A second item list B
The code This function merges two array
The variable keep track index compare
Each time value one array added corresponding index variable incremented
As soon one array exhausted remaining value added end result array using
The function pretty simple need two sorted list combine
As mentioned done splitting array numerous list combining list systematically
This easily done using recursive algorithm The first thing note terminal case array contains zero one item
These array need sorted returned
For array two value array first split half creating array
Each array passed back result passed
So algorithm first sorting left half array sorting right half array merging result
Through recursion eventually get point two array merged
This implementation merge sort return different array one passed sort
If would like create sort always empty original array refill sorted item This version function store result sort variable called
The best way replace item array using method accepts two argument
The first argument index first value replace second argument number value replace
Each subsequent argument value inserted position
Since way pas array value need use pas first two argument combined sorted array
So unshift apply splice
Then original array returned
Merge sort may useful sorting algorithm learn good performance easy implementation
As sorting algorithm I covered still best start native attempting implement additional algorithm
In case native method right thing provide fastest possible implementation
Note however implementation use stable sorting algorithm
If using stable sorting algorithm important need implement one

learn share knowledge build career
Throughout high school loved physic much
I always wanted PhD physic
Along thought pursuing space science
But due certain reason ended Computer Science
I started third year bachelor degree
I hate computer Science loved physic lot I dunno maybe yes even reason nostalgic
Suddenly become nostalgic physic
And thinking whether advisable chose physic MS
So question follows Are research area I always wanted research combine Physics Computer Science
If Yes get
I Bachelors India mind MS US US allow change branch MS allowed india What strategy get research career involves physic Computer Science
Right I third year year Bachelors Course Information Technology
I want PhD
Will future research career option combined field Physics Computer Science
Following certain point would want stress I talked friend good coder suggested get making apps simulate certain physic fundae
But want
I would want stress liked actual physic
So think would enjoy simulating stuff
I research kinda guy application oriented person
Once want stress hate computer science consider bad
want loved rather completely changing stream difficult well risky make guilty conscious would waste four whole year want strike balance want
Anything would allow study Computer Science Physics Space Technology decent research career later want
Just give idea exactly loved physic We advanced physic high school managed stuff fair extent
I loved mechanic electrostatics relativity fluid thermodynamics stuff enjoyed solving category problem instance book another one Krotov
Added later sound good option Masters CS many physic related elective trying get job allow sum research physic well possible
I really liked line Just writing code mean real physic
So mean say touch even master CS
Questions Stack Overflow expected relate programming within scope
Consider editing question leaving comment improvement believe question reworded fit within scope
Read
I working project involves physic simulation nerve cell polymer FDTD fiber optic
It really really involved I wo get detail
The upshot order design device need expertise many different field
We fortunate enough expert area require readily available take fair amount programming acumen excellent communication skill able integrate area
A lot physic problem application require numerical analysis one area programming becomes important
Just writing code mean real physic
One great thing pursuing graduate degree relationship build faculty advisor
If want career physic probably academia need relationship get started
A CS degree let hang CS crowd
If want pursue physic program figure way fit CS
A lot place give enough flexibility degree requirement make reality
Sadly least u CS type traditional science would rather physicist code opposed computer scientist know physic
The difference physicist scientist clue proper program structure flow produce horrible albeit working code
Computer scientist know code research front lack actual knowledge field limit
So laboratory choose physicist computer scientist
That said would better get Master PhD Physics take course CS career field want
Choose PhD based limited field I guarantee writing code probably horribly written code way thing
But also limited CS degree
For example I worked company research Nuclear field I deal Chemometrics
In job I lot scientific research read journal get involved field primary role write code support
Basically go route would make happy studying work messy detail later
To get MS Physics top college US need CV show passion Physics
Especially A Being India thing US university go CV SoP mean know B Being field Phy need extra something make accept
You could build profile way suitable MS Physics
Some way also start following passion right rather waiting complete graduation I completed BTech Engineering Physics I exact opposite haha
I wanted CS I like applied research
But thankfully changing field easy lot Programming job
Still I want CS sometime case kinda hopeless late I discovered passion Too late I say point
Anyway I hope post help
Cheers Good luck
Your program Info Technology probably waste time
You missing hardcore course traditional Physics CS major
There many application computer science physic well c biology c chem etc
There basically entire field modern physic would exist CS chaos theory example
Computational astrophysics crap like
If want phd job theoretical physic nowadays knowing much CS help lot unless cut theoretical math basically simulation even still run simulation test theory
Also problem probably better asked would want consider taking GRE Physics Examination admission US graduate program physic
You also ask question regarding various academic program

Putting data order difficult time consuming
Sorting algorithm bubble sort bucket sort help
What sorting algorithm
Finds item data set data Saves set data Puts list item order What bubble sort
Sorts list comparing two item side side see order Separates list data different collection data sorting gathering back list Finds item data list How many pass bubble sort go
Only one pas Two pass Several pass data fully ordered Why bubble sort final pas even data correct order
To save data It recognise data order final pas requires change It need put data back list Which following advantage bubble sort
It small simple computer program It take long time run It quick Which following advantage bubble sort
It small simple computer program There one task perform It quick What bucket sort
Finds item data list Separates list data different collection data sorted gathered back list Goes list data number time compare two item side side see order Which following disadvantage bucket sort
It take long time run It complicated bubble sort There one task perform Which following advantage bucket sort
It take long time run It quicker run bubble sort It simpler bubble sort Which following type sorting algorithm
Merge sort Insertion sort Long sort

O log typical In also commonly spelled efficient
Most implementation produce mean implementation preserve input order element sorted output
Mergesort invented
A detailed description analysis mergesort appeared report Neumann early
Conceptually merge sort work follows Example code using index top merge sort algorithm recursively split list called example sublists sublist size merges sublists produce sorted list
The copy back step avoided alternating direction merge level recursion
Example code using index bottom merge sort algorithm treat list array sublists called example size iteratively merges back forth two buffer top merge sort algorithm recursively divide input list smaller sublists sublists trivially sorted merges sublists returning call chain
In example function merges left right sublists
bottom merge sort algorithm us small fixed size array reference node array either reference list size reference pointer node
The merge function would similar one shown top merge list example merges two already sorted list handle empty list
In case merge would use input parameter return value
A natural merge sort similar bottom merge sort except naturally occurring run sorted sequence input exploited
Both monotonic bitonic alternating run may exploited list equivalently tape file convenient data structure used
In bottom merge sort starting point assumes run one item long
In practice random input data many short run happen sorted
In typical case natural merge sort may need many pass fewer run merge
In best case input already sorted one run natural merge sort need make one pas data
In many practical case long natural run present reason natural merge sort exploited key component
Example used gather initial run external sorting algorithm
In sorting object merge sort log
If running time merge sort list length recurrence follows definition algorithm apply algorithm two list half size original list add step taken merge resulting two list
The closed form follows
In worst case number comparison merge sort make equal slightly smaller lg lg O lg
For large randomly ordered input list merge sort expected average number comparison approach fewer worst case In case merge sort fewer comparison case
In term move merge sort worst case complexity log complexity quicksort best case merge sort best case take half many iteration worst case
Merge sort efficient quicksort type list data sorted efficiently accessed sequentially thus popular language sequentially accessed data structure common
Unlike efficient implementation quicksort merge sort stable sort
Merge sort common implementation sort place therefore memory size input must allocated sorted output stored see version need extra space
Variants merge sort primarily concerned reducing space complexity cost copying
A simple alternative reducing space overhead maintain combined structure copy part temporary space direct routine place merged output
With version better allocate temporary space outside routine one allocation needed
The excessive copying mentioned previously also mitigated since last pair line statement function pseudo code become superfluous
One drawback merge sort implemented array working memory requirement
Several variant suggested An alternative reduce copying multiple list associate new field information key element called key
This field used link key associated information together sorted list key related information called record
Then merging sorted list proceeds changing link value record need moved
A field contains link generally smaller entire record le space also used
This standard sorting technique restricted merge sort
An merge sort practical run using drive data sorted large fit
explains merge sort implemented disk drive
A typical tape drive sort us four tape drive
All sequential except rewinds end pas
A minimal implementation get record buffer program variable
Naming four tape drive A B C D original data A using record buffer algorithm similar using pair tape drive instead array memory
The basic algorithm described follows Instead starting short run usually used initial pas read many record memory internal sort create long run distribute long run onto output set
The step avoids many early pass
For example internal sort record save pass
The internal sort often large benefit
In fact technique make initial run longer available internal memory
A sophisticated merge sort optimizes tape disk drive usage
On modern computer paramount importance multilevel used
version merge sort algorithm whose operation specifically chosen minimize movement page machine memory cache proposed
For example algorithm stop partitioning subarrays subarrays size S reached S number data item fitting CPU cache
Each subarrays sorted sorting algorithm discourage memory swap normal merge sort completed standard recursive fashion
This algorithm demonstrated better performance machine benefit cache optimization
suggested alternative version merge sort us constant additional space
This algorithm later refined
Also many application use form merge sorting input get split higher number sublists ideally number merging still make currently processed set fit main memory
Merge sort parallelizes well due use method
Several parallel variant discussed third edition Cormen Leiserson Rivest Stein
The first easily expressed pseudocode keywords This algorithm trivial modification serial version speedup impressive executed run time improvement serial version
A better result obtained using parallelized give parallelism meaning type parallel merge sort run time enough processor available
Such sort perform well practice combined fast stable sequential sort fast sequential merge base case merging small array
Merge sort one first sorting algorithm optimal speed achieved Richard Cole using clever subsampling algorithm ensure merge
Other sophisticated parallel sorting algorithm achieve better time bound lower constant
For example David Powers described parallelized related operate log time PRAM processor performing partitioning implicitly
Powers show pipelined version Batcher log time butterfly practice actually faster log sort provides detailed discussion hidden overhead comparison radix parallel sorting
Although time bound merge sort requires Θ auxiliary space instead merge sort Θ
On typical modern architecture efficient implementation generally outperform mergesort sorting array
On hand merge sort stable sort efficient handling sequential medium
Merge sort often best choice sorting situation relatively easy implement merge sort way requires Θ extra space slow performance linked list make algorithm quicksort perform poorly others heapsort completely impossible
As merge sort default sorting algorithm quicksort previous version Perl
In method use merge sort tuned quicksort depending datatypes implementation efficiency switch fewer seven array element sorted
The kernel us merge sort linked list
us another tuned hybrid merge sort insertion sort become standard sort algorithm array type

This thought I wrote concerning experience combining physic computer science also advice looking
It may may useful
If great
If well thanks stopping anyway
My rather ambitious perhaps insane academic program made real attempt combining program sense skipping course requirement
There realistic way still get PhD place
I intent purpose two different grad student one existing physic department one computer science department
Nonetheless I thought various combination grad level degree two area thing important different goal
You find thought
I divided section undergraduate graduate life seemed rather fitting division make
I would encourage read section least read section applies currently
The quote may humorous point serious
Combinining two area damn difficult level study get worse progress
You really need confidence ability pull
Please take previous paragraph meaning never ever try combining two fashion slightest doubt
If sure start small taking couple course weaker subject see go
If go well contemplate going I say various combination later
Good
You still
You evidently confidence obviously fortitude since writing style apparently caused go psychotic rage yet
Why would want thing good question
Let look two different perspective
Physicists good reason learn computer science
Numerical technique simulation becoming important look complicated phenomenon doo sorry
You probably remember Muppet Show one flew head
Sigh
Nonlinear problem turbulence near impossible solve unless studying simplified case extremely watered example
You need programming skill see really cool stuff going
An aside though whatever let analytical skill waste away
Computers useful still need intuition
You get either incredible genius like Einstein Kolmogoroff getting pen paper trying thing
Maybe I write another column point
At point I need clear something
I said previous paragraph definately need skill
That alot different computer science
I get sense talking physicist think computer science programming
No
Wrong
Thanks playing
Next contestant please
Saying thing akin saying Physics putting number equation
Find physicist think I show someone clue job
I never seen really hard fast definition computer science like I never really seen hard fast definition physic
For computer science study computer work similar physic study nature work
This studying computer science programming useful physicist
You going spending significant chunk time thing
Life alot easier know happening hood
Do know sending single integer within MPI wasteful
Take networking course find hurry
Know anything cache
Do know various trick help take advantagous use cache
Take architecture course know
How compiler
I mean use thing time know
Do know code term optimization
Take compiler course
Get idea yet
Computer science programming help great deal day day work
A reason combine two area mental discipline problem solving skill get
I see rolling eye thinking I must finally slipped rocker serious
When take course particular area learn subject matter also start pick go solving problem
If paying enough attention wake class
In computer science learn think logically
Actually precise term would algorithmically
We think term computer solves problem
This plus negative
The downside people take extreme think term rigid boundary
However upshot learn take problem apart break smaller piece think solving particular small problem combine piece together
Yes physic nearly extent performed computer science
You get much practice computer science
Physics though provides problem solving skill
You learn quickly want successful physic careful work checking consistency
A simple example solving elementary mechanic problem throwing ball roof top want know long ball hit ground
When solve get two different answer positive negative one
Both mathematically correct one make sense problem positive answer
The negative time would correspond elapsed time threw ball
This simple example
As progress physic study find complex one
It never enough simply solve problem also must understand problem enough throw away mathematical nonesense
This includes checking limit make sure sensible answer come unit correct etc
This type checking stressed much computer science
There simply try get solution make sure bug
Physics encourages examing big picture
We first analyze problem get sense try go town
describing well I think
I know sound similar computer science approach breaking problem subtle issue involved issue I fully thought
Physics also encourages intuitive leap
You would surprised many clever solution physic problem
There art applying approximation problem order extract useful information
It art take lot practice consistency check get right extremely powerful
Computer science get much spend much time thinking logically computer would solve problem
Despite blundering section I think important realize two area offer alot knowledge particular area
The problem solving skill get important dramatically help matter
The question becomes whether minor major
Obviously major work may whole lot
The requirement two field likely similar
Furthermore I think also likely fulfill requirement using course field
For example undergrad computer science department science requirement could fulfill taking first two physic course mechanic E M course also required physic department
Similarly physic department also requirement take first two CS course
The result type overlap taking second subject major may result many class minor
Nonetheless going major may problematic
You may enough time energy finance
There hard fast rule deciding minor major
It really depends goal
Here thought Naturally department funding teaching assistantship TA right expect le one grad student
That could mean expecting take majority semester class
It could also mean expect place extra obligation colloquium attendance meeting faculty candidate department
Your funding could also come research assistanship RA
Then person giving RA right expect sufficient work towards project
This could lead delay complete forget project obligation department
The bottom line funding responsibility keep whomever paying happy
If happy could lose funding open whole worm deal unless happen financially wealthy afford grad school
Your advisor important even without trying extra grad work
When start looking combining field desperately need pick good advisor
You need people understand chosen go combine area bonus think good thing time one subject requires attention
If advisor understand cut slack time going rough time
I finished PhDs
Someday I going get back finishing essay

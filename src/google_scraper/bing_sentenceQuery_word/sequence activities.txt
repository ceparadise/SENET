When designing algorithm important make sure step presented correct order
This known sequencing displayed pseudocode flowchart
An plan set instruction solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm These building block help describe solution form ready

An explanation sequencing used algorithm programming Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
For example simple algorithm brushing teeth might consist step Each step instruction performed
Sequencing order step carried
Suppose step algorithm sequence A toothbrush would still used clean teeth toothpaste would still put brush
But step wrong sequence teeth get cleaned toothpaste toothpaste would wasted
A human would realise forgotten add toothpaste start process computer would know anything wrong
A computer programmed
If step programmed wrong sequence computer perform task sequence even incorrect

become popular introduction recursion Computer Science student strong argument persist within nature
For reason many u familiar
They also exist within Computer Science elsewhere surprisingly efficient data structure algorithm based upon sequence
There two main example come mind Is special property number give advantage numerical sequence
Is spatial quality
What possible application could
It seems strange many natural number sequence occur recursive problem I never seen heap
The Fibonacci number sort really nice mathematical property make excellent computer science
Here I sure reason I sure reason main factor
Hope help
another magic see many magic
But Fibonacci number easy calculate also specific name
For example natural number many logic prime within sum computable one produce one one take care One important thing I forgot important impact real life example like wide monitor If algorithm successfully explained simple concise mannor understandable example CS nature better teaching tool could someone come
Fibonacci sequence indeed found everywhere
They useful modeling growth animal population plant cell growth snowflake shape plant shape cryptography course computer science
I heard referred DNA pattern nature
Fibonacci heap already mentioned number child node heap log n
Also subtree starting node child least th fibonacci number
Torrent like protocol use system node supernodes use fibonacci decide new super node needed many subnodes manage
They node management based fibonacci spiral golden ratio
See photo node partitioned one large square smaller one vice versa
See photo I think definitive answer one possibility operation dividing set S two partition one divided one size likely approach many algorithm sometimes numerically described Fibonacci sequence
Let add another data structure Fibonacci tree
They interesting calculation next position tree done mere addition previous node It tie well discussion templatetypedef AVL tree worst fibonacci structure
I also seen buffer extended rather power two case
Just add trivia Fibonacci number describe breading rabbit
You start two rabbit population grows exponentially
Their computation power matrix considered primitive problem Operational Research sort like Prisoner Dilemma primitive problem Game Theory

CMC offer major computer science
As member Claremont Colleges CMC student wishing major CS completing CS major either Pomona Harvey Mudd College
CMC offer Computer Science sequence abbreviated set six course provide substantial course study theory practice computing beginning fundamental concept elementary programming using modern programming language Java Python Scheme
The sequence culminate course emphasizing abstract principle computer science well building system application using modern software development methodology tool
Completion sequence listed student transcript
The requirement CS sequence found
Information major found website
The first three course CS major sequence called core
These core course CSCI CSCI CSCI HMC CSCI CSCI CSCI Pomona CSCI also taught every Fall semester CMC
These course mixed start HMC core must complete HMC core start Pomona core must complete Pomona core
Once student complete core either HMC Pomona may take upper division course either program without restriction

By definition story sequencing student identify component story putting order retelling event sequence
It one many skill contributes reading comprehension
When introducing student story sequencing best first provide instruction
Transition word used writer move one event another
For example first next last
I like start class discussion word student come example may see read write
As student complete activity game remember student different
They read different level interested different thing
Choose text appropriate reading level interest well
When completing independent activity student use different passage appropriate individual learning need
Now let check fun game activity incorporate classroom
Get FREE access day create account
A lot time student already using transition word sequencing without realizing
Have class explain something board follow direction exactly give
This funny student always detailed may skip step two
Reiterate importance step story assign individual group project tell someone something
Your class lot fun may even learn something new
It always excellent possible use student prior knowledge another subject reinforce teaching
History textbook especially although could use science well great passage pull teach student sequence event story
Choose passage textbook type word processor using large font double triple space line
Make sure already include transition word student recognize
Cut sentence put piece bag
Students read sentence carefully put story back correct order
They paste story onto piece construction paper
Using fiction story familiar unfamiliar student depending much challenge would like give write event story individual story card
Each student receive one card cooperate classmate put story back order
This activity helpful allowing stronger student encourage model skill student struggling
Using picture card helpful teaching skill younger student yet reading independently student significant special need
Choose story familiar student daily life event like getting ready school
Find create picture card event three five card enough teach skill
Go picture student sure know happening model put correct order
Have practice set picture card
I absolutely love using graphic organizer help student put event personal writing assignment order
The first one four empty box top bottom
Allow student label box first next last
They illustrate story correct order
On next page allow student translate illustration sentence still sure include transition word
On last page able write clear story sequential order paragraph form
A important concept reading comprehension story sequencing help student identify story part
In lesson examined word prior knowledge
You also provided five activity game use introducing story sequencing student
project using content area story card picture card writing project excellent way teach student identify replicate reading skill

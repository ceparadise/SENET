process defining module interface satisfy specified
Systems design could seen application
There overlap discipline
If broader topic blend perspective marketing design manufacturing single approach product development design act taking marketing information creating design product manufactured
Systems design therefore process defining developing satisfy specified user
Until system design crucial respected role industry
In hardware software resulted ability build system
The increasing importance software running generic platform enhanced discipline
method becoming widely used method computer system design
The become standard language analysis design
It widely used modeling software system increasingly used high designing system organization
The architectural design system emphasizes design describes system analysis
The logical design system pertains abstract representation data flow input output system
This often conducted via modelling using sometimes graphical model actual system
In context system design included
Logical design includes ER diagram
The physical design relates actual input output process system
This explained term data input system processed displayed
In physical design following requirement system decided
Put another way physical portion system design generally broken three User Interface Design concerned user add information system system present information back
Data Design concerned data represented stored within system
Finally Process Design concerned data move system validated secured transformed flow system
At end system design phase documentation describing three produced made available use next phase
Physical design context refer tangible physical design information system
To use analogy personal computer physical design involves input via keyboard processing within CPU output via monitor printer etc
It would concern actual layout tangible hardware PC would monitor CPU motherboard hard drive modem card USB slot etc
It involves detailed design user product database structure processor control processor
The personal specification developed proposed system
RAD methodology system designer produce prototype
The review prototype offer feedback suitability
This process repeated satisfied final system
JAD methodology evolved RAD system designer consults group consisting following party JAD involves number stage group collectively develops agreed pattern design implementation system

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue

The goal user interface design make user interaction simple efficient possible term accomplishing user goal
Good user interface design facilitates finishing task hand without drawing unnecessary attention
utilized support influencing user performs certain interaction improving aesthetic appeal design design aesthetic may enhance detract ability user use function interface
The design process must balance technical functionality visual element create system operational also usable adaptable changing user need
Interface design involved wide range project computer system car commercial plane project involve much basic human interaction yet also require unique skill knowledge
As result designer tend specialize certain type project skill centered expertise whether user research
User interface design requires good understanding user need
There several phase process user interface design demanded upon others depending project
Note remainder section word used denote project whether
The dynamic characteristic system described term dialogue requirement contained seven principle part ergonomics standard
This standard establishes framework ergonomic principle dialogue technique definition illustrative application example principle
The principle dialogue represent dynamic aspect interface mostly regarded feel interface
The seven dialogue principle The concept usability defined standard effectiveness efficiency satisfaction user
Part give following definition usability Effectiveness efficiency satisfaction seen quality factor usability
To evaluate factor need decomposed finally usability measure
The information presentation described Part standard organization information arrangement alignment grouping label location display graphical object coding information abbreviation color size shape visual cue seven attribute
The attribute presented information represent static aspect interface generally regarded look interface
The attribute detailed recommendation given standard
Each recommendation support one seven attribute
The seven presentation attribute The user guidance Part standard describes user guidance information readily distinguishable displayed information specific current context use
User guidance given following five mean User interface design topic considerable research including
Standards developed far back defining usability software product
One structural base become IFIP user interface reference model
The model proposes four dimension structure user interface This model greatly influenced development international standard describing interface design requirement usability
The desire understand UI issue early software development even application developed led research GUI rapid prototyping tool might offer convincing simulation actual application might behave production use
Some research shown wide variety programming task software fact specified mean writing program code
Research recent year strongly motivated increasing variety device virtue host complex interface
Research also conducted generating user interface automatically match user level ability different level interaction
At moment addition traditional prototype literature proposes new solution experimental mixed prototype based configurable physical prototype allow achieve complete sense touch thanks physical realistic visual experience thanks superimposition virtual interface physical prototype Augmented Reality technique

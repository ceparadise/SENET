In lexical structure grouped together
Blocks consist one
A programming language permit creation block including block nested within block called
Blocks fundamental formed block
The function block programming enable group statement treated one statement narrow variable procedure function declared block conflict variable name used elsewhere program different purpose
In programming language name variable object procedure declared outer block visible inside inner block unless object name
Ideas block structure developed development first formalized report
Algol introduced notion compound statement related solely
The subsequent described syntax semantics Algol introduced notion block block consisting A sequence declaration followed sequence statement enclosed begin end e declaration appears block way valid block
Blocks use different syntax different language
Two broad family Some technique used follows Some language support block variable declaration fully support declaration instance many language permit function definition within block
And unlike ancestor Algol Pascal support use block declaration inside begin end existing block compound statement enabling sequence statement grouped together control statement
The semantic meaning block twofold
Firstly provides programmer way creating arbitrarily large complex structure treated unit
Secondly enables programmer limit scope variable sometimes object declared
In primitive language early statement type little mean extending structured manner
For instance standard Fortran block statement write code implement simple decision programmer resort Even brief Fortran fragment written Fortran standard easy see structure program structure reflected language
Without careful study easy see circumstance given statement executed
Blocks allow programmer treat group statement unit default value appear initialization style programming block structure placed closer decision Use block fragment enables programmer clearer intends combine resulting block nested hierarchy conditional statement
The structure code reflects programmer thinking closely making easier understand modify
From looking code programmer easily see make source code even clearer taking inner statement outer one altogether placing two block one executed consecutively
Semantically little difference case use block structure supported indenting readability make easy programmer refactor code
In primitive language variable broad scope
For instance integer variable called IEMPNO might used one part Fortran subroutine denote employee social security number ssn maintenance work subroutine programmer might accidentally use variable IEMPNO different purpose could result bug difficult trace
Block structure make easier programmer control scope minute level
In fragment empno used identify manager underling respective ssn underling ssn declared within inner block interact variable name contains manager ssn
In practice consideration clarity would probably lead programmer choose distinct variable name choice difficult introduce bug inadvertently
In circumstance code block evaluated code actually top block outside block
This often colloquially known includes

What term block mean wrt computer science
I seen used multiple occassions never understood mean
Like blocking
Googling seem help much
Blocking mean program essentially asks Get data I wait ready
This contrast
There two flavor Get data I going go something else
Interrupt data ready
Get data I going go something else
I ask later yet
It important program block waiting data ca thing like respond mouse click repaint screen
This happening see program labeled Not Responding task manager
In summary mean process hang wait completes
cover passing focussing block progress program communication progress leaving system resource idle
When program make many operation mean processor spend almost time idle waiting operation complete Of course help much next step something data
Blocking simpler move obvious way You ca since involves setting object connection fed single multiplexor constantly look next thing come
Imagine two approach different thousand million connection
You choose one factor like For example problem blocking holding several thousand connection open one thread system like several thousand thread
But turn fairly complex issue
Read perception including PDF
In addition indicating programming context also mean
First meaning block easy computer science block source code computer language
For perl etc
curly bracket block code delimits block code
Python use indentation block
The second meaning used context operating system usually called kernel seen supreme manager manages resource
When different process thread ask system call resource CPU disk network memory resource may available due multiple competing thread process asking thing
The kernel put process thread suspension wait queue allowing process thread working resource execution state
The suspended process blocking state blocked
Blocking achieve either hardware software mechanism operating system
The running process also ask operating system suspend execution sleep command Shell perl

To specify block text press special beginning end block
The function key differ one another
Word processor usually display block highlighting
In data management block group
Blocks manipulated unit
For example often block
In block unit data transferred together
For example transfer block byte
In general larger block size faster
In word processing specify section text

In specifically sometimes called sequence usually containing whole number maximum length
Data thus structured said
The process putting data block called process extracting data block
Blocked data normally stored read written whole block time
Blocking reduces speed handling
For device magnetic tape blocking reduces amount external storage required data
Blocking almost universally employed storing data NAND rotating medium
Most based level hardware responsible storing retrieving specified block data though block size file system may multiple physical block size
This lead space inefficiency due since file length often integer multiple block size thus last block file may remain partially empty
This create
Some newer file system attempt solve technique called
Other file system support variable block size
Block storage normally abstracted file system DBMS use application end user
The physical logical volume accessed via may device internal server directly attached via distant device accessed via SAN using protocol
DBMSes often use block improved performance recoverability compared layering DBMS top file system

Could someone provide layman definition use case
Blocking mean caller wait callee finish processing
For instance blocking read socket wait data return read return indication usually count whether something read
You hear term mostly around APIs access resource necessarily require CPU attention instance
You also hear A call Thread A Thread B might designed block hold Thread A Thread B achieves relevant state process least accept request
The obvious example join usually mean I Thread A want wait Thread B terminated use exiting program
In simple word If call function stop program continuing run user performed action action program controlling call called blocking call

But Ghz referring
This referring
The clock computer clock wall used tell time
A computer clock like metronome keep beat musician play music
A clock change value every period
We use letter designate period
This signal repeat
Perhaps remember course calculus sine wave
This wave repeat per period
The difference sine wave clock sine wave curved
It gradually increase decrease
A clock signal squarish shape
Related period clock
Frequency defined unit
When hear clock rate usually given frequency
Thus Ghz mean cycle per second
A signal single period
The period clock second half nanosecond really really short period time
To give idea short time
Imagine everyone world sang exactly one note exactly one person sings time
Suppose note last one nanosecond
It would take second complete assuming billion people world
As see clock signal positive slope negative slope
This slope exaggerated see better
Normally would quite angled
There key feature clock Each positive clock edge appears per clock period
Each negative clock edge appears per clock period
Must clock always
The answer
We could clock stay three quarter period one quarter period fraction
If using positive edge matter long signal stay since use edge
However want use positive negative edge going consider want edge occur
Begin move finger right trace signal
Your finger move back
If happen trace positive edge second steadily moving right going faster slower period second frequency Hz
Tracing signal hand give better feel continuous signal behaves
Usually computer science major difficult time unless really like calculus engineering deal quantity discrete rather continuous
At point time someone ask current value signal
If use pipe analogy think signal alternating pumping red soda green soda
To give analogy imagine music conductor tapping beat baton stick regular interval
Suppose playing piano told play new note time tap baton
Thus fast conductor tap baton control often play note
Similarly rate positive clock edge appears control fast sequential logic device change output
It turn using clock design CPU easily use clock
This primary reason use clock

When designing algorithm important make sure step presented correct order
This known sequencing displayed pseudocode flowchart
An plan set instruction solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm These building block help describe solution form ready
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation sequencing used algorithm programming Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
For example simple algorithm brushing teeth might consist step Each step instruction performed
Sequencing order step carried
Suppose step algorithm sequence A toothbrush would still used clean teeth toothpaste would still put brush
But step wrong sequence teeth get cleaned toothpaste toothpaste would wasted
A human would realise forgotten add toothpaste start process computer would know anything wrong
A computer programmed
If step programmed wrong sequence computer perform task sequence even incorrect

There problem loading menu right

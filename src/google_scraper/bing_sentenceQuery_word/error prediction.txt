A say statement
It often always based upon experience knowledge
There universal agreement exact difference two term different author discipline ascribe different
Contrast
Although guaranteed accurate information future many case impossible prediction useful assist making possible development Howard Stevenson writes prediction business least two thing Important hard
In sense term prediction often used refer
A prediction kind might informed predicting person may useful predicting person field
The technique eliciting prediction controlled way
This type prediction might perceived consistent statistical technique sense minimum data used predicting expert forming In prediction part
One particular approach inference known prediction undertaken within several approach statistical inference
Indeed one possible description statistic provides mean transferring knowledge sample population whole population related population necessarily prediction time
When information transferred across time often specific point time process known
Forecasting usually requires method prediction often performed
Statistical technique used prediction include various etc
In case forecasting model utilized
When related generalized set regression method deployed commercial usage field known
In many application time series analysis possible estimate model generate observation
If model expressed transfer function term parameter smoothed filtered predicted data estimate calculated
If underlying generating model linear smoother may used recover data interest noisy measurement
These technique rely predictor minimise variance prediction error
When generating model nonlinear stepwise linearizations may applied within smoother recursion
However nonlinear case optimum performance guarantee longer apply
To use regression analysis prediction data collected variable predicted called response variable one variable whose value influence called explanatory variable
A often linear hypothesized postulated causal relationship function chosen optimize way function thus parameterized data
That estimation step
For prediction step explanatory variable value deemed relevant future current yet observed value dependent variable input parameterized function generate prediction dependent variable
In science prediction rigorous often quantitative statement forecasting would happen specific condition example apple fell tree would attracted towards center earth specified constant
The built testing statement scientific theory
This done repeatable observational study
A contradicted observation evidence rejected
New theory generate many new prediction easily supported see
Notions make prediction usually considered part science nescience testable prediction made
frequently used describe past future behaviour process within boundary model
In case outcome rather specific outcome predicted example much
In permit avoidance emptying
In possible failure mode predicted avoided correcting mechanism causing failure
Accurate prediction forecasting difficult area
For example possible predict occurrence exact timing magnitude much difficult see picture right
Established science make useful prediction often extremely reliable accurate example routinely predicted
New theory make prediction allow disproved reality
For example predicting structure crystal atomic level current research challenge
In early century scientific consensus existed absolute given name
The existence absolute frame deemed necessary consistency established idea speed light constant
The famous demonstrated prediction deduced concept borne reality thus disproving theory absolute frame reference
The proposed Einstein explanation seeming inconsistency constancy speed light special preferred absolute frame reference
theory could easily tested produce effect observable terrestrial scale
However theory predicted large mass would bend light contradiction accepted theory observed eclipse
Mathematical model behaviour economic behaviour general also unreliable predicting future behaviour
Among reason economic event may span several year world changing similar time frame thus invalidating relevance past observation present
Thus extremely small number order relevant past data point project future
In addition generally believed stock market price already take account information available predict future subsequent movement must therefore result unforeseen event
Consequently extremely difficult predict
In contrast predicting actual stock return forecasting broad economic trend tends better accuracy
Such analysis provided group well private institution including brokerage house consulting company
Some correlation seen actual stock market movement prediction data large group survey prediction game
An us ass predict future business risk
For example actuary would use incorporates historical experience mortality rate sometimes estimate future trend project
Predicting outcome sporting event business grown popularity recent year
Handicappers predict outcome game using variety mathematical formula simulation model
Early well known sport bettor believed access information gave edge
Information ranged personal issue gambling drinking undisclosed injury anything may affect performance player field
Recent time changed way sport predicted
Predictions typically consist two distinct approach Situational play statistical based model
Situational play much difficult measure usually involve motivation team
Dan Gordon noted handicapper wrote Without emotional edge game addition value line I put money
These type play consist Betting home underdog betting Monday Night winner favorite next week betting underdog look ahead game etc
As situational play become widely known become le useful impact way line set
The widespread use technology brought modern
These system typically algorithm simulation model based
sport statistician brought attention sport result model published USA Today
He currently paid consultant advice lineup use Winval system evaluates free agent
former fighter pilot turned sport statistician published result using regression analysis predict outcome NFL game
widely accepted leading authority college basketball statistic
His website includes College Basketball Ratings tempo based statistic system
Some statistician become famous successful prediction system
Dare wrote effective odds sport betting horse racing direct result human decision therefore potentially exhibit consistent error
Unlike game offered casino prediction sporting event logical consistent
Other advance model include based Bayesian network causal probabilistic model commonly used risk analysis decision support
Based kind mathematical modelling Constantinou et developed model predicting outcome association football match
What make model interesting apart taking consideration relevant historical data also incorporate vague subjective factor like availability key player team fatigue team motivation
They provide user ability include best guess thing hard fact available
This additional information combined historical fact provide revised prediction future match outcome
The initial result based modelling practice encouraging since demonstrated consistent profitability published market odds
Nowadays sport betting huge business many website system alongside betting site give tip prediction future game
Some prediction website tipster based human prediction others computer software sometimes called prediction robot bot
Prediction bot use different amount data algorithm accuracy may vary
In common attempt predict outcome via technique ass popularity use
used many corporation government learn likely outcome future event
Predictions often made antiquity present using mean observing
Methods including many form used millennium attempt predict future
These mean prediction proven scientific experiment
In literature vision prophecy literary device used present possible timeline future event
They distinguished vision referring individual see happen
The book thus us vision literary device regard
It also prophecy prophetic literature related individual public forum
attempt gain insight question situation way occultic standardized process ritual
It integral part witchcraft used various form thousand year
Diviners ascertain interpretation proceed reading sign event alleged contact agency often describe angel god though viewed Christians Jews fallen angel demon
Fiction especially fantasy science fiction often feature instance prediction achieved unconventional mean

Prediction research fulfills one basic desire humanity discern future know fate hold
Such foresight used involve studying star looking entrails animal
Obviously pay heed method modern world many people expect scientist become new soothsayer predict humanity environment universe end
To certain extent scientist regularly use prediction research fundamental generate predict happen
These prediction effect direct whole scientific discipline Relativity underpinned research Physics Biology many year
On hand smaller experiment also wider ramification allow humanity predict therefore avoid future event
One earliest example Muslim scholar
He asked find best location build hospital city Baghdad
Cleverly hung piece meat predicted place meat took longest rot would best place build hospital
Although knew little exact process behind transmission illness realized environment unhealthier others especially hot climate gangrene problem
His idea used many year bacterial process behind illness uncovered
Sticking medicine later found wonderful work Semmelweiss scientist responsible saving countless thousand life
In Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis close friend Jakob Kolletschka cut finger autopsy contracted nasty disease known puerperal fever
Semmelweis also killed percent woman giving birth hospital whilst nearby hospital run entirely midwife lost two percent birthing mother
Semmelweis noticed student moved autopsy room delivery room without washing hand predicted reason higher death rate teaching hospital
He informed student wash hand chlorine solution entering maternity wing mortality rate puerperal fever promptly dropped two percent
Unfortunately unfortunate Semmelweis became victim politics director hospital livid young doctor indirectly blaming high rate mortality made sure Semmelweis never worked Vienna
Eventually returned Budapest used method eventually publishing book finding
Sadly medical establishment rejected idea disillusioned Semmelweis died mental institution severely beaten guard
The autopsy revealed extensive internal injury cause death blood poisoning
Eventually Englishman Joseph Lister began using carbolic acid disinfectant year later gave Semmelweis full credit prediction research saved thousand life
The unfortunate scientist also gave name scientific phenomenon known Effect new research based upon bold prediction swiftly rejected threatens established paradigm much
Wegener also suffered effect postulated idea continental drift prediction rejected almost entire scientific community
One fine example making experimental prediction generating work conducted wonderfully innovative series physic experiment making prediction
After completed experiment showed prediction basis fitted observation made next prediction worked towards greater goal stage
Of course physicist also work end scale make huge prediction capable shaking world science
Some biggest proponent prediction research theoretical physicist Einstein Hawking
They use sweeping elegant mathematical theory predict think universe behaves
Their prediction actually guide direction entire scientific paradigm empirical physicist test attempt part theory leading refinement change
Astronomy thrown great example prediction science largely built upon law motion proposed Newton
One finest example arises discovery planet Neptune stand testament skill astronomer also work Newton
The discovery planet showed work largely correct circumstance Theory Relativity explained physic extreme scale
The planet Uranus discovered William Herschel made nearly one entire revolution sun
Excited astronomer realized looking star chart documenting progress planet orbit irregular follow Newtonian prediction planetary moment
They predicted possible explanation planet influence another large planet lying exerting gravitational pull
In Britain France astronomer set predict position new planet find
Two astronomer found planet Urbain Le Verrier Paris John Couch Adams Cambridge
Le Verrier take credit first announce discovery scientist located planet application Newtonian physic
This great advertisement power prediction research similar indirect deduction still used find cosmological object
Strangely enough even intuitively backwards looking discipline history us prediction research
Most historian state thesis equivalent set find evidence support deny
One greatest example adventurer Harald Schliemann
He firmly believed Homer Iliad gave geographical clue measurement would allow find site Priam Troy
Patiently collated information raised funding setting using Iliad roadmap
He found ruined city academic believe Troy prediction supported
His archaeological method crude destructive nobody fault detective work power prediction
As part humanity quest understand nature predictive science much widespread
Much due exponential growth computing power allows gradually detailed accurate model
These great use predicting weather natural disaster earthquake tsunami
The factor driving growth prediction research politics economics
Predicting weather benefit economy informing farmer expect allows emergency service predict adverse weather may require action
Economics prediction driven current economic crisis show incorrect prediction devastating although whether politician choose listen advice computer prediction model disagree policy another matter
With million dollar invested government oil company using prediction geologist know drill test well predictive science going grow
However entire field science computing rest upon foundation drove early scientist principle making prediction setting test
Unfortunately prediction whim paymaster whether government private sector
This always compromise integrity scientist making prediction prediction research always drive scientific method
That prediction anyway

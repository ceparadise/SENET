Can anybody explain fault masking consequence
From way ignore fault seamlessly preparing backup component execute something soon instruction sent using sort voting protocol main backup give result flawed output ignored
Imagine five CPUs Space Shuttle crunching number
If one produce anomalous result result ignored
The four CPUs election masked hid bad result
Since tagged testing textbook definition might looking An acceptance test successfully mask bad value retry alternate result new correct result within time limit set declaring failure
Also see discussion final answer clear example Fault masking presence one defect hide presence another defect
example If Negative Value cause firing unhandled system exception developer prevent negative value input
This resolve issue hide defect unhandled exception firing

system designed around concept
In essence must able continue working level satisfaction presence fault
Fault tolerance property individual machine may also characterise rule interact
For example TCP designed allow reliable communication even presence communication link imperfect overloaded
It requiring endpoint communication packet loss duplication reordering corruption condition damage data integrity reduce throughput proportional amount
Recovery error system characterised either
When system detects made error recovery take system state time corrects able move forward
recovery reverts system state back earlier correct version example using move forward
recovery requires operation checkpoint detected erroneous state made
Some system make use recovery different error different part one error
Most designed handle several possible failure including fault failure failure temporary permanent failure error interface error hardware software including failure operator error erroneous keystroke bad command sequence installing unexpected software physical damage flaw introduced system outside source
Hardware common application system designed prevent failure due hardware component
Most basically provided particularly
Typically component multiple backup separated smaller segment act contain fault extra redundancy built physical connector power supply fan etc
There special software instrumentation package designed detect failure fault masking way ignore fault seamlessly preparing backup component execute something soon instruction sent using sort voting protocol main backup give result flawed output ignored
Software based around nullifying programming error using redundancy static emergency subprogram fill program crash
There many way conduct depending application available hardware
The first known computer built
Its basic design connected via relay voting method detection
Several machine developed along line mostly military use
Eventually separated three distinct category machine would last long time without maintenance one used computer dependable required constant monitoring used monitor control experiment finally computer high amount runtime would heavy use many supercomputer used monitoring
Most development LLNM Long Life No Maintenance computing done NASA preparation research aspect
NASA first machine went second attempt JSTAR computer used
This computer backup memory array use memory recovery method thus called JPL computer
It could detect error fix bring redundant module needed
The computer still working today
computer pioneered mostly manufacturer company USA
These needed computer massive amount uptime would enough fault allow continued operation relying fact computer output would constantly monitored human detect fault
Again IBM developed first computer kind NASA guidance rocket later built
The redundancy
In general early effort design focused mainly internal diagnosis fault would indicate something failing worker could replace
SAPO instance method faulty memory drum would emit noise failure
Later effort showed fully effective system diagnosing isolating fault implementing redundant backup alerting need repair
This known redundancy fault cause automatic fail safe warning operator still common form level one design use today
Voting another initial method discussed multiple redundant backup operating constantly checking result outcome example four component reported answer one component reported answer four would vote fifth component faulty taken service
This called M N majority voting
Historically motion always move M N due fact complexity system difficulty ensuring transitive state disrupt operation
among first company specializing design computer system
The important requirement design computer system making sure actually meet requirement reliability
This done using various failure model simulate various failure analyzing well system reacts
These complex involving probability curve specific fault rate curve error rate like
The commonly used model HARP SAVE SHARPE USA SURF LASS Europe
Research kind tolerance needed critical system involves large amount interdisciplinary work
The complex system carefully possible interaction considered prepared
Considering importance system transport military field topic touch research wide include obvious subject reliability arcane element model formal exclusionary logic remote
technique enables continue executing despite
The technique handle attempt read invalid memory returning manufactured value program turn make use manufactured value ignores former value tried access
This great contrast inform program error abort program
In computing attempt made inform program error occurred
The approach performance cost technique rewrite code insert dynamic check address validity execution time increase
Recovery shepherding lightweight technique enable software program recover otherwise fatal error null pointer dereference divide zero
Comparing failure oblivious computing technique recovery shepherding work compiled program binary directly need recompile program
It us framework
It attache application process error occurs repair execution track repair effect execution continues contains repair effect within application process detaches process repair effect flushed process state
It interfere normal execution program therefore incurs negligible overhead
For systematically collected real world error prototype implementation enables application continue execute provide acceptable output service user input

I trouble understanding point Subnet Masks
I reading nice article topic left bit confused
When I first heard Subnets explained small independent network connected main internet one point
For example office building would subnet thousand computer instead wasting thousand regular IP address
However article seems subnet collection computer IP address subnet mask used describe bit one range subnetwork
Example article So point
We still save IP address I want contact Dave Bill I still send message
How subnets make life easier contribute anything
The main benefit size routing table
Instead store entry every machine network need store entry particular subnet
For example ISP might anyone sending packet outside machine subnet need know route border
Their border router fine grained view subnet probably split many subnets know router network send packet based smaller subnet belongs
Thus subnets provides level abstraction OUTSIDE
Not INSIDE seemed expected
EDIT Here simplified example
Assume large ISP network
Within large network two smaller network
To reach system either two smaller network system outside need know address border router
Once packet reach router managing router know get
Finally home router even need know address router
It blindly send packet router home ISP assuming larger router know get typically called default
Here way think
Think train station get city A B
When look map train station city A tell train take get city B
However map tell get final destination city B
However city B probably find detailed map tell get final destination within city B need access map still city A

I fairly new C programming I encountered bit masking
Can someone explain general concept function bit masking
Examples much appreciated
A mask defines bit want keep bit want clear
Masking act applying mask value
This accomplished Below example extracting subset bit value Applying mask value mean want clear first higher bit keep last lower bit
Thus extracted lower bit
The result Masking implemented using AND C get Here fairly common Extracting individual byte larger word
We define bit word first byte
We use two operator shift right
This extract four byte integer Notice could switch order operator could first mask shift
The result would use different mask Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Stories statistic
We following continuing conversation among journalist programmer educator education United States whether everyone code
It question come often circle pleased read thoughtful nuanced conversation last week Tasneem Raja interactive editor In one statistic particular caught eye The United States graduated proportionally fewer major
Could really
We live age techology company growing exponential rate case order retain best people
So looked
It true percentage bachelor degree awarded computer science percent total significantly higher percentage percent
But focusing single difference miss far interesting story
Take look chart showing proportion bachelor master degree
Aside looking remarkably like Cisco representation San Francisco iconic Golden Gate Bridge chart clearly show fluctuation interest among undergraduate graduate computer science
The reason fluctuation clear graph couple theory In many elementary middle high school taught computer programming student according Joanna Goode
As associate professor education study University Oregon Goode researched access woman student color computer science
But PC revolution took place introduction prepackaged software Internet changed typical school curriculum programming approach computer literacy course use computer Goode wrote email
That could explain rise degree early would grade school drop student elementary school learned use computer program one
Fluctuations attainment often connected fluctuation job market certain industry
The peak degree came four year introduction IBM heyday Apple II likely led increased interest getting degree
Similarly second wave early came four year development bubble Silicon Valley job IPOs seemed almost ubiquitous
The subsequent decline major followed bursting bubble
In either case data seem indicate midst another rise interest computer science college level
Whether result better education lower grade level increased interest related ubiquity smartphones boom say unclear
Furthermore focus major miss larger point
As Raja argues essay simply teaching kid code goal
Just perhaps teaching kid think like computer called computational She highlight current effort teach computational thinking elementary secondary school particularly girl member minority group remain woefully underrepresented among professional computer programmer
And teaching computational thinking may result degree important contribution make giving people across field ability solve problem like computer scientist speak language computer programming
As Raja note skill everyone access regardless major

The began long modern discipline emerged century hinted century prior
The progression mechanical invention theory towards led major academic field basis massive worldwide industry
The earliest known tool use computation developed period BCE
The Sumerians abacus consisted table successive column delimited successive order magnitude number system
Its original style usage line drawn sand pebble
Abaci modern design still used calculation tool today
In BC invented
It first known mechanism use later used
The also invented sophisticated abacus around century BC known
In century BC formulated rule known highly systematized technical
Panini used metarule
The believed early mechanical analog computer
It designed calculate astronomical position
It discovered wreck Greek island Antikythera Kythera dated BC
Mechanical analog computer device appeared thousand year later developed mechanical geared
According also made important advance development
machine also invented automatic player brother programmable considered first analog computer
Technological artifact similar complexity appeared century mechanical
When discovered logarithm computational purpose early century followed period considerable progress inventor scientist making calculating tool
In designed calculating machine abandoned project prototype started building destroyed fire
Around leading French mathematician constructed mechanical adding device based design described mathematician
Then invented completed
In first described accepted first design modern computer
The analytical engine expandable memory arithmetic unit logic processing capability able interpret programming language loop conditional branching
Although never built design studied extensively understood
The analytical engine would memory capacity le kilobyte memory clock speed le Hertz
Considerable advancement mathematics electronics theory required first modern computer could designed
In developed formal mathematical sense writing binary numeral system
In system one zero also represent value state
But took century published complete system allowed computational process mathematically modeled
By time first mechanical device driven binary pattern invented
The driven forward mechanization many task included
controlled loom hole punched card indicated binary unpunched spot indicated binary
Jacquard loom far computer illustrate machine could driven binary system
Before sometimes human clerk performed computation
They usually lead physicist
Many thousand computer employed commerce government research establishment
Most computer woman
Some performed astronomical calculation calendar others ballistic table military
After expression referred machine performed work human computer especially accordance effective method
The thesis state mathematical method effective could set list instruction able followed human clerk paper pencil long necessary without ingenuity insight
Machines computed continuous value became known kind
They used machinery represented continuous numeric quantity like angle shaft rotation difference electrical potential
Digital machinery contrast analog able render state numeric value store individual digit
Digital machinery used difference engine relay invention faster memory device
The phrase gradually gave way late onset electronic digital machinery became common
These computer able perform calculation performed previous human clerk
Since value stored digital machine bound physical property like analog device logical computer based digital equipment able anything could described purely mechanical
The theoretical created hypothetical device theorized order study property hardware
often regarded one first pioneer computing
Beginning Babbage vision mechanically computing number table
Putting reality Babbage designed calculator compute number decimal point long
Continuing success idea Babbage worked develop machine could compute number decimal place
By Babbage devised plan develop machine could use punched card perform arithmetical operation
The machine would store number memory unit would form sequential control
This mean one operation would carried another way machine would produce answer fail
This machine known Analytical Engine first true representation modern computer
Augusta Ada Byron credited pioneer computer programming regarded mathematical genius result mathematically heavy tutoring regimen mother assigned young girl
Lovelace began working Charles Babbage assistant Babbage working Analytical Engine first mechanical computer
During work Babbage Ada Lovelace became designer first computer algorithm ability compute
Moreover Lovelace work Babbage resulted prediction future computer perform mathematical calculation also manipulate symbol mathematical
While never able see result work Analytical Engine created lifetime effort later year beginning go unnoticed
The mathematical foundation modern computer science began laid
In theorem showed limit could proved disproved within
This led work Gödel others define describe formal system including concept
In Alan Turing independently also together introduced formalization limit computed purely mechanical model computing
This became hypothesis nature mechanical calculation device electronic computer
The thesis claim calculation possible performed algorithm running computer provided sufficient time storage space available
In also published seminal work abstract digital computing machine simply referred
This machine invented principle modern computer birthplace concept almost modern day computer use
These hypothetical machine designed formally determine mathematically computed taking account limitation computing ability
If Turing machine complete task considered Turing computable commonly Turing complete
The physicist described view fundamental importance Turing paper letter I know von Neumann well aware fundamental importance Turing paper Von Neumann introduced paper urging I studied care
Many people acclaimed von Neumann father computer modern sense term I sure would never made mistake
He might well called midwife perhaps firmly emphasized others I sure fundamental conception owing Turing Up electrical engineer able build electronic circuit solve mathematical logic problem manner lacking theoretical rigor
This changed engineer Akira Nakashima
From Nakashima published series paper showing discovered independently unaware work describe operation switching circuit
This concept utilizing property electrical switch logic basic concept underlies electronic
Switching circuit theory provided mathematical foundation tool design almost area modern technology
Nakashima work later cited elaborated seminal master thesis
While taking undergraduate philosophy class Shannon exposed work recognized could used arrange electromechanical relay used telephone routing switch solve logic problem
His thesis became foundation practical digital circuit design became widely known among electrical engineering community World War II
In developed world first functional computer
In shown principle
Zuse also developed computing machine considered first computer
He founded one earliest computer business producing became world first commercial computer
In designed first
In completed world first general purpose electronic digital computer also ran stored program like almost modern computer
The influence Turing seminal paper contribution project crucial successful development
In Britain completed small scale programmable computer based Turing philosophy
With operating speed MHz Pilot Model ACE time fastest computer world
Turing design much common today architecture called memory roughly capacity early computer enormous standard day
Had Turing ACE built planned full would different league early computer
went found field paper titled applied problem best encode information sender want transmit
This work one theoretical foundation many area study including
From experiment system interpreted radar image detect enemy plane coined term Greek word steersman
He published Cybernetics influenced
Wiener also compared computing machinery device cognitive similarity analysis brain wave
The first actual computer bug
It stuck relay Harvard Mark II
While invention term often erroneously attributed future rear admiral Navy supposedly logged bug September account conflict least detail
According account actual date September operator filed along insect notation First actual case bug found see detail
In model computer architecture introduced became known
Since von Neumann model provided uniformity subsequent computer design
The von Neumann architecture considered innovative introduced idea allowing machine instruction data share memory space
The von Neumann model composed three major part arithmetic logic unit ALU memory instruction processing unit IPU
In von Neumann machine design IPU pass address memory memory turn routed either back IPU instruction fetched ALU data fetched
Von Neumann machine design us RISC Reduced instruction set computing architecture mean instruction set us total instruction perform task
This contrast CISC instruction set instruction choose
With von Neumann architecture main memory along accumulator register hold result logical operation two memory addressed
Operations carried simple arithmetic performed ALU include addition subtraction multiplication division conditional branch commonly seen statement loop
The branch serve statement logical move different component machine move accumulator memory vice versa
Von Neumann architecture accepts fraction instruction data type
Finally von Neumann architecture simple one register management also simple
The architecture us set seven register manipulate interpret fetched data instruction
These register include IR instruction register IBR instruction buffer register MQ multiplier quotient register MAR memory address register MDR memory data register
The architecture also us program counter PC keep track program machine

So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

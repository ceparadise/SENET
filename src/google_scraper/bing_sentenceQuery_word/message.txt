In computer science bit data sent sender recipient
This usually done copying data around
In model recipient act certain way message

In sends message process may relies process supporting infrastructure select invoke actual code run
Message passing differs conventional programming process subroutine function directly invoked name
Message passing key
Message passing used ubiquitously modern computer software
It used way object make program work mean object system running different computer Internet interact
Message passing may implemented various mechanism including
Message passing technique invoking behavior running program computer
In contrast traditional technique calling program name message passing us distinguish general function specific implementation
The invoking program sends message relies object select execute appropriate code
The justification using intermediate layer essentially fall two category encapsulation distribution
idea software object able invoke service object without knowing caring service implemented
Encapsulation reduce amount coding logic make system maintainable
rather statement determine subroutine function call developer send message object object select appropriate code based type
One first example used domain computer graphic
There sort complexity involved manipulating graphic object
For example simply using right formula compute area enclosed shape vary depending shape triangle rectangle elipse circle
In traditional computer programming would result long statement testing sort object shape calling appropriate code
The way handle define class called subclass turn subclass simply send message asking compute area
Each object invoke subclass method formula appropriate kind object
Distributed message passing provides developer layer architecture provides common service build system made run disparate computer different location different time
When distributed object sending message messaging layer take care issue One important distinction among message passing system whether use synchronous asynchronous message passing
Synchronous message passing occurs object running time
With asynchronous message passing possible receiving object busy running requesting object sends message
Synchronous message passing typical programming language Java Smalltalk use
Asynchronous message passing requires additional capability storing retransmitting data system may run concurrently
The advantage synchronous message passing conceptually le complex
Synchronous message passing analogous function call message sender function caller message receiver called function
Function calling easy familiar
Just function caller stop called function completes sending process stop receiving process completes
This alone make synchronous message unworkable application
For example synchronous message passing would used exclusively large distributed system generally would perform well enough usable
Such large distributed system may need continue operate subsystem subsystem may need go offline kind maintenance time subsystem open receiving input system
Imagine busy business office desktop computer send email using synchronous message passing exclusively
Because office system use asynchronous message passing one worker turning computer cause computer freeze worker turn computer back process single email
Asynchronous message passing generally implemented complexity naturally occur trying synchronize system data handled intermediary level software
Commercial vendor develop software product support intermediate level usually call software
One common type middleware support asynchronous messaging called MOM
With asynchronous message passing sending system wait response
Continuing function call analogy asynchronous message passing would function call return immediately without waiting called function execute
Such asynchronous function call would merely deliver argument called function tell called function execute return continue execution
Asynchronous message passing simply sends message message bus
The bus store message receiving process request message sent
When receiving process arrives result sends result message bus message bus hold message original process designated next process pick message message bus
Synchronous communication built top asynchronous communication using
For example work ensuring sender always wait acknowledgement message receiver
The sender sends next message acknowledgement received
On hand asynchronous communication also built top synchronous communication
For example modern generally provide primitive asynchronous messaging implemented top using
The buffer required asynchronous communication cause problem full
A decision made whether block sender whether discard future message
If sender blocked may lead unexpected
If message dropped communication longer reliable
These example kind problem middleware vendor try address
In addition distinction synchronous asynchronous message passing primary distinguishing feature message passing system whether use distributed local object
With distributed object sender receiver may exist different computer running different operating system using different programming language etc
In case bus layer take care detail converting data one system another sending receiving data across network etc
The RPC protocol early example
Note type message passing requirement either sender receiver implemented using programming
It possible wrap system developed using procedural language treat large grained object capable sending receiving message
Examples system support distributed object
Distributed object system called shared nothing system message passing abstraction hide underlying state change may used implementation sending message
Distributed asynchronous message passing overhead associated compared simpler way simply calling procedure
In traditional argument passed receiver typically one containing address argument
This form communication differs message passing least three crucial area In message passing transferring argument involved operation involves copying existing argument portion new message upon creation
This applies regardless size argument case argument large document megabyte worth data
The argument copied entirety transmitted receiving object
By contrast standard procedure call address bit need passed argument may even passed requiring zero additional storage zero transfer time
This course possible distributed system since absolute address caller address space normally meaningless remote program however might fact usable receiver copy least sender memory advance
Web example process communicate message passing
A example way referencing resource depend exposing internals process
A call invocation exit invoked computation terminated
Asynchronous message passing contrast result response arriving significant time request message sent
A message handler general process message one sender
This mean state change reason unrelated behavior single sender client process
This contrast typical behavior object upon method invoked latter expected remain state method invocation
In word message handler behaves analogously
The prominent mathematical model message passing
In mathematical term message single mean pas control object
If object responds message message
argued message passing important object OOP object often
The programming model build upon observation us concept characterize behavior complex distributed system term message pattern using specification

In computer science programming language keywords whose meaning already assigned language example using c java instruction termination done semicolon
Data type declared int float char based type
Conditional logic like else switch loop like hav particular meaning defined
And want define scope function n use curly bracket
In case miss semicolon program spelled keyword wrong missed closing bracket get syntax error
Which indicates spelling mistake missing semicolon writting mistake
A syntax writing something programming language
If want computer understand command use correct syntax otherwise would recognize show syntax error
Just take simple example Suppose I want text I want pen drive belongs third person say RAJ
So correct way text would Here apostrophe important syntax telling pen drive belongs Raj
If I use apostrophe would syntax error
Still question

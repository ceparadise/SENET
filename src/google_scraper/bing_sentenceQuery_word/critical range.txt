In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined

The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science

Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

In book Exercise show piece code compute value polynomial The exercise assumes clock cycle needed addition multiplication respectively
The reader asked explain According exercise answer iteration need update variable operation need addition multiplication latter dominates latency causing ultimate CPE
But I think data flow something like So longest path previous value new value going execution unit
Therefore longest time cycle
I want ask Any explanation CPU architecture execution unit pipeline unit appreciated
I know I bit late party book absolutely right
As verify timing code CPE indeed second answer wrong
But first one also wrong
It say MULs must performed time possible Nehalem architecture I suspect modern processor
Remember one FP MUL unit different FP ADD unit shown book ed
later What happens instead LOADs assumed always present cycle cache First feed MUL
Immediately feed remember pipeline
cycle get new value cycle result
At point new computation stage MUL
So cycle rest ops want restricted
Of course easy need cycle FP ADD get new
So becomes obvious limiting factor computation
Which mean looking critical path whatever look specifically path old value new
In case path consists one FP ADD
threw first The critical path indeed cycle question asks CPE like time output one cycle loop
Other first last cycle processor addition previous iteration loop current multiplication time operand dependent
The first iteration loop take full cycle iteration loop take cycle run making actual CPE cycle

I agree book way presenting critical path confusing
Their definition critical path simply path take longest path path also operation operand depends previous operation order
This definition make finding critical path rather intuitive
The critical path longest path graph case eight clock
This say critical path Prioritized Topological Orders Without resource constraint shortest schedule given critical path longest path graph
A metric useful priority function height node length longest path graph originating node
I think found error book
You consider contacting author correct future printing
The critical path longest one data flow graph according book must straight line effect single register rather add whose result intermediate operand next operation
About question get done continuing read rest
Especially comparing data flow graph one helpful
If understood clear answer book reasonable

I researched question ca find consensus
If A depends B term dependency refer Does term different meaning different subdomains computer technology
B would dependency
You probably use dependency form B dependency A
I suppose Option also partly true dependency describes relationship
In UML mean method capable instantiating object method call like Or get function parameter But actually store object field variable becomes association
Here true

Database dependency topic often confuses student database professional alike
Fortunately complicated best illustrated use number example
In article examine common database dependency type
A dependency occurs database information stored database table uniquely determines information stored table
You also describe relationship knowing one attribute set attribute enough tell value another attribute set attribute table
Saying dependency attribute table saying functional dependency attribute
If dependency database B dependent upon attribute A would write A B
For example In table listing employee characteristic including Social Security Number SSN name said name dependent upon SSN SSN name employee name uniquely determined SSN
However reverse statement name SSN true one employee name different SSNs
A occurs describe functional dependency attribute collection attribute includes original attribute
For example A B B name SSN SSN
This type functional dependency called trivial derived common sense
It obvious already know value B value B uniquely determined knowledge
A occurs already meet requirement functional dependency set attribute left side statement reduced
For example SSN age name functional dependency remove age left side statement without impacting dependency relationship
occur indirect relationship cause functional dependency
For example A C true A B B C true
occur presence one row table implies presence one row table
For example imagine car company manufacture many model car always make red blue color model
If table contains model name color year car company manufacture table
If row certain model name year blue must also similar row corresponding red version car
Database dependency important understand provide basic building block used
For example There error

In degree interdependence software module measure closely connected two routine module strength relationship module
Coupling usually contrasted
often correlate high cohesion vice versa
Low coupling often sign good design combined high cohesion support general goal high readability maintainability
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured design including cohesion coupling published article book latter subsequently became standard term
Coupling low also loose weak high also tight strong
Some type coupling order highest lowest coupling follows A module refers subroutine kind
set one statement name preferably set variable name
In recent work various coupling concept investigated used indicator different modularization principle used practice
Tightly coupled system tend exhibit following developmental characteristic often seen disadvantage Whether loosely tightly coupled system performance often reduced message parameter creation transmission translation
marshaling message interpretation might reference string array data structure require le overhead creating complicated message message
Longer message require CPU memory produce
To optimize runtime performance message length must minimized message meaning must maximized
One approach decreasing coupling seek limit responsibility module along functionality
Coupling increase two class Low coupling refers relationship one module interacts another module simple stable interface need concerned module internal implementation see
Systems allow object communicate without know anything object implementation
Both system even allow object communicate object written language
Coupling term occur together frequently
Coupling refers interdependency module cohesion describes related function within single module
Low cohesion implies given module performs task related hence create problem module becomes large
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling make value larger coupled module
This number range approximately low coupling highly coupled For example module single input output data parameter If module input output data parameter equal number control parameter access item global data

It occurs attribute table database dependent value part table primary key entire primary key
Functional dependency also referred normalization introduced Professor Codd
It defines three normal form first second third used avoid three anomaly type may affect database
These three anomaly insertion deletion update
An anomaly occurs database incomplete inconsistent contradictory
The basic aim normalization create proper description attribute particular data
It highlight relationship different data table
For example table student may student name course admission number grade field entry
If one field related normalization ensures change detail one student affect detail another
With anomaly user insert new data even absolutely necessary
In addition deleting data one student may result loss data another
Similarly record updated instance item updated

A variable tested measured scientific experiment
It sometimes called
The dependent variable depends independent variable
As experimenter change independent variable change dependent variable observed recorded
For example scientist testing effect light dark behavior moth turning light
The amount light moth reaction
A change independent variable amount light directly cause change dependent variable moth behavior
Another example dependent variable test score
How well score test depends variable much studied amount sleep whether breakfast
In general studying effect factor outcome effect outcome dependent variable
If measure effect temperature flower color temperature independent variable one control color flower dependent variable
If dependent independent variable plotted graph would independent variable would dependent variable
For example examine effect sleep test score number hour sleep would test score would recorded graph
There error

Scientists try figure natural world work
In use experiment search
Cause effect relationship explain thing happen allow reliably predict happen something
In word scientist design experiment observe measure change one thing cause something else vary repeatable way
The thing changing experiment called
A variable factor trait condition exist differing amount type
An experiment usually three kind variable independent dependent controlled
The changed scientist
Why one
Well changed one variable would hard figure change causing observe
For example scientific question How size dog affect much food eats
feeding experiment changed size dog time day dog fed
The data might get bit larger dog eat le food smaller dog size middle day dog prefer eat morning
Sometimes impossible change one variable case scientist rely mathematical analysis additional experiment try figure going
Older student invited read page
To clear though science fair usually wise independent variable time
If new science project want know effect changing multiple variable multiple test focus one independent variable time
The thing scientist focus observation see respond change made independent variable
In dog example dependent variable much dog eat
This observing measuring
It called dependent variable trying figure whether value depends value independent variable
If direct link two type variable independent dependent may uncovering cause effect relationship
The number dependent variable experiment varies one
Experiments also
Controlled variable quantity scientist want remain constant must observe carefully dependent variable
For example dog experiment example would need control hungry dog start experiment type food feeding whether food type liked
Why
If explanation could given difference observe much eat
For instance maybe little dog eats hungrier day maybe big dog like dog food offered maybe dog eat wet dog food dry dog food
So keep variable control see effect one variable independent variable trying test
Similar example experiment one controlled variable
Some people refer controlled variable constant variable
In best experiment scientist must able value variable
Weight mass example variable easy measure
However imagine trying experiment one variable love
There thing
You might belief someone love really sure would probably friend agree
So love measurable scientific sense therefore would poor variable use experiment
Using Google Classroom Integration educator assign test student understanding variable science experiment
Educators also assign student online fill detailing variable science project
Different water pressure might also cause different amount water flow different faucet may behave differently ensure fair test I want keep water pressure faucet faucet opening I test
More stirring might also increase amount sugar dissolve different sugar might dissolve different amount ensure fair test I want keep variable cup water
The many variable change fast plant grows ensure fair test fertilizer must kept every pot
The work motor performs big impact speed ensure fair test I must keep variable
In experiment time cause dependent variable change
The scientist simply start process observes record data regular interval
When scientist performs test survey different group people thing group define independent variable
For example Sometimes variable simply represents binary condition
For example something might either present present experiment

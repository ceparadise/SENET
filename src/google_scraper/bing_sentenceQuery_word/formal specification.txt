In mathematically based technique whose purpose help implementation system software
They used describe system analyze behavior aid design verifying key property interest rigorous effective reasoning tool
These specification sense syntax semantics fall within one domain able used infer useful information
In passing decade computer system become increasingly powerful result become impactful society
Because better technique needed assist design implementation reliable software
Established engineering discipline use mathematical analysis foundation creating validating product design
Formal specification one way achieve software engineering reliability predicted
Other method commonly used enhance code quality
Given possible use technique demonstrate system design correct respect specification
This allows incorrect system design revised major investment made actual implementation
Another approach use probably correct step transform specification design ultimately transformed implementation
It important note formal specification implementation rather may used develop
Formal specification describe system system
A good specification must following attribute adequate internally consistent unambiguous complete satisfied minimal A good specification One main reason interest formal specification provide ability perform proof software implementation
These proof may used validate specification verify correctness design prove program satisfies specification
A design implementation ever declared correct
It ever correct respect given specification
Whether formal specification correctly describes problem solved separate issue
It also difficult issue address since ultimately concern problem constructing abstracted formal representation informal concrete abstraction step amenable formal proof
However possible specification proving challenge concerning property specification expected exhibit
If correct theorem reinforce specifier understanding specification relationship underlying problem domain
If specification probably need changed better reflect domain understanding involved producing implementing specification
Formal method software development widely used industry
Most company consider apply software development process
This may variety reason Other limitation Formal specification technique existed various domain various scale quite time
Implementations formal specification differ depending kind system attempting model applied point software life cycle introduced
These type model categorized following specification paradigm In addition paradigm way apply certain heuristic help improve creation specification
The paper referenced best discus heuristic use designing specification
They applying approach
The example leading formal
Others include Specification Language AMN
In area formal specification often used describe property Web service
Some tool For implementation example refer link section

In specifically particular kind based technique development system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Formal method used number level may undertaken program developed informally
This dubbed
This may option many case
may used produce program formal manner
For example proof property program may undertaken
This may appropriate system involving
may used undertake fully formal proof
This expensive practically worthwhile cost mistake extremely high critical part microprocessor design
Further information expanded
As style formal method may roughly classified follows Some practitioner believe formal method community overemphasized full formalization specification design
They contend expressiveness language involved well complexity system modelled make full formalization difficult expensive task
As alternative various formal method emphasize partial specification focused application proposed
Examples lightweight approach formal method include object modelling notation Denney synthesis aspect driven development CSK Tools
Formal method applied various point
Formal method may used give description system developed whatever level detail desired
This formal description used guide development activity see following section additionally used verify requirement system developed completely accurately specified
The need formal specification system noted year
In report presented formal notation describing programming language syntax later named renamed BNF
Backus also wrote formal description meaning syntactically valid ALGOL program completed time inclusion report
Therefore formal treatment semantics legal program included subsequent paper
It never appeared
Once formal specification produced specification may used guide concrete system process realized typically software also potentially hardware
For example Once formal specification developed specification may used basis property specification hopefully inference developed system
Sometimes motivation proving system obvious need correctness system desire understand system better
Consequently proof correctness produced style handwritten typeset using using level informality common proof
A good proof one readable understandable human reader
Critics approach point inherent natural language allows error undetected proof often subtle error present detail typically overlooked proof
Additionally work involved producing good proof requires high level mathematical sophistication expertise
In contrast increasing interest producing proof correctness system automated mean
Automated technique fall three general category Some automated theorem provers require guidance property interesting enough pursue others work without human intervention
Model checker quickly get bogged checking million uninteresting state given sufficiently abstract model
Proponents system argue result greater mathematical certainty proof since tedious detail algorithmically verified
The training required use system also le required produce good mathematical proof hand making technique accessible wider variety practitioner
Critics note system like make pronouncement truth yet give explanation truth
There also problem program aid verification unproven may reason doubt soundness produced result
Some modern model checking tool produce proof log detailing step proof making possible perform given suitable tool independent verification
The main feature abstract interpretation approach provides sound analysis
false negative returned
Moreover efficiently scalable tuning abstract domain representing property analyzed applying widening operator get fast convergence
Formal method applied different area hardware software including router Ethernet switch routing protocol security application
There several example used verify functionality hardware software used DCs
IBM used theorem prover AMD processor development process
Intel us method verify hardware firmware permanent software programmed memory
used formal method develop compiler system went become commercial product
There several project NASA formal method applied Unmanned Aircraft System integration National Airspace System Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution Detection ACCoRD
used develop safety automatism various subway installed throughout world also Common Criteria certification development system model
Formal verification frequently used hardware hardware vendor IBM Intel AMD
There many area hardware Intel used FMs verify working product parameterized verification cache coherent protocol Intel Core processor execution engine validation using theorem proving symbolic evaluation optimization Intel architecture using HOL light theorem prover verification high performance gigabit Ethernet controller support PCI express protocol Intel advance management technology using Cadence
Similarly IBM used formal method verification power gate register functional verification IBM microprocessor
In formal method mathematical approach solving software hardware problem requirement specification design level
Formal method likely applied software system
Software safety assurance standard demand formal method highest level categorization
For sequential software example formal method include specification language used
In allowed mathematical specification testing exhaustive testing expected behaviour individual function
The specialization allowed system formally specified necessarily formally verified
For concurrent software system based see also allow executable software specification used build validate application behavior
Another approach formal method software development write specification form variation FOL directly execute logic though program
The language based DL example
There also work mapping version English another natural language automatically logic executing logic directly
Examples Internet Business Logic seek control vocabulary syntax
A feature system support bidirectional mapping direct execution logic made explain result English business scientific level
There variety formal method notation available

If want write formal specification program written Java know logic program written
I searched Internet book rigorously teach subject semantics programming language formal specification I could find three I find rigorous quite date
Merged post follows I phrase question differently
Let say I wrote program
How I create formal specification program I written
Two popular specification language Z notation VDM Vienna Development Method
So I wrote program mean I translate program Z notation VDM
But I
Do I need know semantics order
I searched net book teach semantics could find
Formal spec mean lot thing
It almost sound like want model checker Aside formally specify program C C dangerous semantics
Perhaps program used subset involved pointer used reference exclusively could formally specify
Is class
It almost sound like want model checker Aside formally specify program C C dangerous semantics
But dangerous semantics
No class
It something I interested knowing
proper superset C way Objective C example
There valid C program valid
For example C typedef struct give name
This valid since struct class everything public default
The dangerous semantics C involve pointer
C inherently unsafe memory model
Subtle error buffer overrun miscalculated pointer arithmetic etc corrupt program memory lead nondeterministic behavior

The word ontology seems generate lot controversy discussion AI
It long history philosophy refers subject existence
It also often confused epistemology knowledge knowing
In context knowledge sharing I use term ontology mean
That ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology general
And certainly different sense word use philosophy
What important ontology
My colleague I designing ontology purpose enabling knowledge sharing reuse
In context ontology specification used making ontological commitment
The formal definition ontological commitment given
For pragmetic reason choose write ontology set definition formal vocabulary
Although way specify conceptualization nice property knowledge sharing among AI software semantics independent reader context
Practically ontological commitment agreement use vocabulary ask query make assertion way consistent complete respect theory specified ontology
We build agent commit ontology
We design ontology share knowledge among agent
This definition given article Gruber
A translation approach portable ontology

A detailed description given Gruber
Toward principle design ontology used knowledge sharing
Presented Padua workshop Formal Ontology March later published Vol
Issues November pp

With excerpt attached
An explicit specification conceptualization
The term borrowed philosophy Ontology systematic account Existence
For AI system exists represented
When knowledge domain represented declarative formalism set object represented called universe discourse
This set object describable relationship among reflected representational vocabulary program represents knowledge
Thus context AI describe ontology program defining set representational term
In ontology definition associate name entity universe discourse class relation function object text describing name mean formal axiom constrain interpretation use term
Formally ontology statement logical theory
We use common ontology describe set agent communicate domain discourse without necessarily operating globally shared theory
We say agent ontology observable action consistent definition ontology
The idea ontological commitment based perspective Newell
The Knowledge Level level description knowledge agent independent representation used internally agent
Knowledge attributed agent observing action agent know something act information acting rationally achieve goal
The action agent knowledge base server system seen tell ask functional interface Levesque client interacts agent making logical assertion tell posing query ask
Pragmatically common ontology defines vocabulary query assertion exchanged among agent
Ontological commitment agreement use shared vocabulary coherent consistent manner
The agent sharing vocabulary need share knowledge base know thing agent commits ontology required answer query formulated shared vocabulary
In short commitment common ontology guarantee consistency completeness respect query assertion using vocabulary defined ontology
Notes Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited conservative definition definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world Enderton
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term

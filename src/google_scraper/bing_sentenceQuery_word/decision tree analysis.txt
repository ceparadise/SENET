Your parent love movie come town go cinema
Since goal decision tree decide weekend plan answer
But parent come town
We go back branch decision box finish decision tree
If parent come town need decide going
As think option realize weather important factor
Weather becomes next box
Since spring time know either rainy sunny windy
Those three possibility become branch
Get FREE access day create account
If sunny rainy know play tennis stay respectively
But windy
If windy want get house probably wo able play tennis
You could either go movie go shopping
What determine go shopping go see movie
Money
Your branch hit another box money factor
You decide two possibility money either rich poor depending week paycheck work schedule
If get good paycheck go shopping
If time movie
With decision tree weekend plan made even though number factor could impact plan
Because thought situation plan every combination paycheck weather visit parent
useful management tool help formalize thought process provide graphical representation different factor may influence plan

In machine learning desirable come meaningful rule order predict occur future
For example probably happen
Decision tree built automatically used come rule
A decision tree used investigate huge amount data come probable outcome
Each condition node tree
Each outcome node
The concept piece information acquired effect level certainty particular prediction
If one know information particular event occur one certain event
For example know Apple decorated product announcement conference venue splash paint make wild guess releasing device
If find executive ebook store claim working closely Apple ebooks greater degree certainty product going announce tablet
This concept information gain used make machine learning prediction
The level certainty particular decision measured number completely uncertain completely certain
developed Claude Shannon defines value uncertainty measure used calculate amount uncertainty
For example event probability entropy
If probability entropy little lower
The goal machine learning get low entropy order make accurate decision classification
In order calculate entropy following formula used H stand entropy
The minus sign used create positive value entropy
The logarithm used make compact efficient decision tree
The uncertainty entropy decision event various situation calculated
The entropy change information narrowed
dataset split particular piece information
The branch information split
new piece information considered lower entropy calculated
The difference initial entropy new entropy following branch give amount information gained
Thus following notation observation H B entropy original decision
H B A C entropy original decision given information I provided H B A weighted average H B A Ci number different alternative H B H B D information gain
A continuous piece information make discrete using threshold threshold
Decision tree constructed using algorithm split data feature maximum information gain recursively branch
maketree featurelist example return tree BASE CASE featurelist empty entropy empty tree leaf majority answer example RECURSION feature largest information gain remove featurelist empty tree T possible value x feature get example x maketree new T T The algorithm look feature within featurelist determines provide largest information gain
Once found removed list candidate considered
A created subset original respectively exluding feature
Each possible value feature recursively called narrowed example algorithm continue performing step indicated
The base case reached provided feature feature exhausted entropy equal complete certainty
For case algorithm return leaf node consisting probable outcome
Overfitting occur tree large result obscure rule
Round two
The whole lecture
recomended website help

us go observation item represented branch conclusion item target value represented leaf
It one predictive modelling approach used
Tree model target variable take discrete set value called tree structure represent class label branch represent feature lead class label
Decision tree target variable take continuous value typically called
In decision analysis decision tree used visually explicitly represent decision
In decision tree describes data resulting classification tree input
This page deal decision tree
Decision tree learning method commonly used data mining
The goal create model predicts value target variable based several input variable
An example shown diagram right
Each corresponds one input variable edge child possible value input variable
Each leaf represents value target variable given value input variable represented path root leaf
A decision tree simple representation classifying example
For section assume input finite discrete domain single target feature called classification
Each element domain classification called
A decision tree classification tree tree internal node labeled input feature
The arc coming node labeled input feature labeled possible value target output feature arc lead subordinate decision node different input feature
Each leaf tree labeled class probability distribution class
A tree learned splitting source subset based
This process repeated derived subset recursive manner called
See example illustrated figure space partitioned using recursive partitioning recursive binary splitting
The completed subset node value target variable splitting longer add value prediction
This process TDIDT example far common strategy learning decision tree data
In decision tree described also combination mathematical computational technique aid description categorization generalization given set data
Data come record form The dependent variable Y target variable trying understand classify generalize
The vector composed feature x x x used task
Decision tree used two main type The term analysis used refer procedure first introduced et al
Trees used regression tree used classification similarity also difference procedure used determine split
Some technique often called method construct one decision tree A special case decision tree decision tree every internal node exactly leaf node exactly internal node child except bottommost node whose child single leaf node
While le expressive decision list arguably easier understand general decision tree due added sparsity permit learning method monotonic constraint imposed
construction decision tree training tuples
A decision tree structure internal node denotes test attribute branch represents outcome test leaf terminal node hold class label
The topmost node tree root node
There many specific algorithm
Notable one include CART invented independently around time yet follow similar approach learning decision tree training tuples
Algorithms constructing decision tree usually work choosing variable step best split set item
Different algorithm use different metric measuring best
These generally measure homogeneity target variable within subset
Some example given
These metric applied candidate subset resulting value combined averaged provide measure quality split
Used Gini impurity measure often randomly chosen element set would incorrectly labeled randomly labeled according distribution label subset
Gini impurity computed summing probability item label chosen time probability mistake categorizing item
It reach minimum zero case node fall single target category
To compute Gini impurity set item class suppose let fraction item labeled class set
Used algorithm
based concept
Entropy defined fraction add represent percentage class present child node result split tree
Information gain used decide feature split step building tree
Simplicity best want keep tree small
To step choose split result purest daughter node
A commonly used measure purity called information measured bit confused unit computer memory
For node tree information value represents expected amount information would needed specify whether new instance classified yes given example reached node
Consider example data set four attribute outlook sunny overcast rainy temperature hot mild cool humidity high normal windy true false binary yes target variable play data point
To construct decision tree data need compare information gain four tree split one four feature
The split highest information gain taken first split process continue child node pure information gain
The split using feature windy result two child node one windy value true one windy value false
In data set six data point true windy value three play value yes three play value
The eight remaining data point windy value false contain two six yes
The information node calculated using entropy equation
Since equal number yes node For node eight data point six yes two
Thus To find information split take weighted average two number based many observation fell node
To find information gain split using windy must first calculate information data split
The original data contained nine yes five
Now calculate information gain achieved splitting windy feature
To build tree information gain possible first split would need calculated
The best first split one provides information gain
This process repeated impure node tree complete
This example adapted example appearing Witten et al
Introduced CART variance reduction often employed case target variable continuous regression tree meaning use many metric would first require discretization applied
The variance reduction node defined total reduction variance target variable due split node set presplit sample index set sample index split test true set sample index split test false respectively
Each summands indeed estimate though written form without directly referring mean
Amongst data mining method decision tree various advantage In decision tree path root node leaf node proceed way conjunction
In decision graph possible use disjunction ORs join two path together using MML
Decision graph extended allow previously unstated new attribute learnt dynamically used different place within graph
The general coding scheme result better predictive accuracy probabilistic scoring
In general decision graph infer model fewer leaf decision tree
Evolutionary algorithm used avoid local optimal decision search decision tree space little bias
It also possible tree sampled using

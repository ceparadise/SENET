Henrik Kniberg team way mean team whole skill needed build product team member willing thing
But line drawn
Is normal ask developer become tester iteration required
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
My take team team includes people different function company engineering IT technical writing marketing finance legal sale HR operation quality executive
In larger company function put silo line management get thing done generally need time someone
If TDD something like yes perfectly normal
However general responsibility signing developer work hand developer
A team one functional expert different domain come together ass built useful
In agile environment assessment happen often
However domain expert determine
Software developer develop software
Testers test
Operations people run software
Having opinion development testing operation extremely useful defining good product lie value team
A good team need people jack trade also master
Usually one two
For instance one I worked
I specialize couple web language I know million
I fluent video editing medium sort thing side plus business project management
So rather small team taking large project I hardcore coding day spend part grunt work site getting different medium ready
Not many project use skill rely multiple I think
Some time really good efficient design time much
Thank God I developer network fun

The simple definition team CFTs team made people different functional area within engineering sale human resource example
These team take many form often set working group designed make decision lower level customary given company
They either primary form organizational structure exist addition company main hierarchical structure
team become popular recent year three primary reason improve coordination integration span organizational boundary reduce production cycle time new product development
Bringing people together different discipline improve problem solving lead thorough decision making
The team foster spirit cooperation make easier achieve customer satisfaction corporate goal time
team new
Northwestern Mutual Life insurance company pioneered use CEO company brought together people financial investment actuarial department study impact computer would business world
As result first CFT Northwestern among first company country create information system department gave company large competitive advantage computer gained popularity
The company relies team almost every facet organization
Based success story like one CFTs slowly grew popularity throughout exploding popularity faster production time increased organizational performance became critical almost every industry
team similar conventional work team differ several important way
First usually composed member competing loyalty obligation primary subunit within company example marketing person serving team strong tie home department may conflict role asked play CFT
Second company CFTs used basis opposed permanent organizational structure often temporary group organized one important purpose mean group member often considerable pressure
On temporary team early development stable effective group interaction imperative
Finally CFTs often held higher performance standard conventional team
Not expected perform task produce product also expected reduce cycle time create knowledge CFT process disseminate knowledge throughout organization
For team succeed several factor identified imperative Without one element team fighting uphill battle succeed
Many business able use team reduce cycle time new product development
As result CFTs become common tool new product development many company especially industry rapid change innovation norm
CFTs shown flexibility adapt changing market need ability quickly develop innovative product
In past new product development invariably meant gathering data sequentially number department new product given green light
First idea would conceptualized
Then would handed marketing department would conduct market research see product viable
The product might passed sale department would asked create sale estimate
From idea would move engineering manufacturing would determine cost produce product
Finally number gathered course month even year product would move executive committee would either approve kill project
By time market condition sometimes shifted sufficiently render product obsolete
team eliminate throw wall mentality pass product department department
Instead member functional area would representative new product team
Team member would learn new product time would begin working estimate together
If part product simply could manufactured cheaply enough team member area could immediately sit engineering rep come new production method
The two could meet marketing sale team member discus new way position product market
The result say proponent vastly improved product manufactured released market far le time achieved using traditional method
When CFTs first convened conflict may result
There good chance member new team bumped head past functional area clashed project
Additionally CFT member may think area specialty important team thus assume inflated sense value team
Finally since CFTs often bring together people vastly different rank organizational hierarchy power play member employee team actually le important stakeholder team
Those team member may try assert authority team situation deferring team member
The best way solve conflict set clear goal team
It important start general goal improving quality specific goal set almost immediately give group common bond ensure everyone working together towards goal
Goals easier establish research conducted someone organization team convened
This allows team jump right without getting bogged background research
When setting goal important clearly define problem need solved solution need achieved
If desired solution held outcome group focus becomes range option narrowed fit solution team even begin work
Also setting goal team determine operating limit face
For example time budget limitation considered
Are solution deemed undesirable company officer
The team must recognize limitation work around hope successful reaching goal
The final point thing sure identify key interdependency one team member finish part project another team member get started
It essential know sequential step team get deep project
Stakeholders people stand benefit lose work team
Every stakeholder represented team stakeholder make break team
For example key department head believe team needed withhold best employee participating team thus depriving team resource
Or department head choose ignore work team conducting business usual team threatens traditional role company
It business ownership management key CFT member make stakeholder understand importance team purpose priority
Customers whether internal external also stakeholder
Teams spend maximum allowable time interacting customer learn need outcome expect team
Some CFTs find work best one person named act customer liaison make easier customer provide team feedback allows team one person go training client management skill
Other business success letting customer either join team attend team meeting observer
When identifying stakeholder determine level representation need team
Some group need permanent member others may need participate certain area project
Communicate stakeholder anyone else company affected team work
Do spring make people resistant work team trying achieve
Communication step decided upon front planned carefully part project
Northwestern Mutual Life one leader CFTs expanded stakeholder idea
When used create CFT Northwestern followed traditional model appointed people whose role crucial process hand
That longer case
Now Northwestern experimenting appointing one person CFT stakeholder
Colleen Stenholt director human resource Northwestern quoted magazine saying One goal break box stakeholder people built box
She went note outsider desirable locked established way thinking often thus able bring fresh perspective problem
CFTs often face regular conflict situation
This especially true team relatively new
Business owner manager aware however important step taken manage reduce conflict including Many people think team successful large company
Conventional wisdom dictate small company probably already operating company small people perform multiple task work together everyone else company
While may true operation certainly true majority small business
Most small operation weigh pro con like larger counterpart deciding whether use CFTs
Those chosen adopt CFTs largely pleased result
For example magazine documented use CFTs Reprint Management Services Lancaster Pennsylvania small company fewer employee
The owner business originally arranged company functional unit found odd assortment employee left fit existing team
As result created permanent team handle special project company
The result immediate impressive
He claimed since adopting team concept Staff member also benefitted CFT arrangement
Employees understand different process occur throughout organization understand interrelationship different functional area
Instead looking one silo operation employee see big picture
Indeed according CFT supporter participating employee often improve interpersonal skill make better employee make attractive job market choose pursue opportunity
Finally proponent say employee le likely become bored job given opportunity learn new skill CFT
The overall goal team increased organizational profit teamwork
As result company develop new compensation system reward member team
One example team incentive pay
Instead individual merit increase team member instead earn reward based overall team performance
The incentive pool funded increased profit new business created result using team
The amount compensation earned team incentive model actually far greater obtained standard individual merit pay system
Another system proven popular organization utilize CFTs system called Pay Applied Services PAS
Under system employee learn apply new skill base pay increased
In addition performance bonus available team company perform better expected
PAS work way employee identify primary service basic job skill title
This primary service determines person salary
A salary range determined people provide primary service ranging maximum based experience performance
Employees increase salary traditional way gaining increase within service range learn new service qualify bonus increase
In addition individual increase employee earn team incentive bonus total percent base pay
Team incentive paid per year
team become integral part business landscape many industry recent year
But observer point use unintended drawback company watchful
For example analyst note CFTs actually limit professional growth team member narrow focus one area
One company profiled found two year serving team team member becoming bored learning client business category handled team
The solution
Once twice every year team member reorganized new team could learn new skill
As result new team environment rose percent client reported questionnaire company performance met exceeded goal percent time
percent client rated company better competition came service
Some company try hand project CFTs simply large scope essentially doomed failure start
Such large project lack focus needed CFT success trying make project work environment sour entire organization using CFTs project
Another sure pitfall establish CFT without imposing either project deadline interim reporting deadline
Without sense urgency complete project project almost certainly stall fail
Converting employee new compensation system CFTs implemented difficult well
When team incentive replace individual merit increase team member often complain even though money earned system
Employees often feel little control whether profit actually increase therefore control earning raise
Additionally many employee balk giving merit increase sake team
They may see team plan way demand team individual without giving anything back return

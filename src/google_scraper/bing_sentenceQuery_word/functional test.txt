In style building structure element treat evaluation avoids data
It paradigm mean programming done declaration instead
In functional code output value function depends passed function calling function twice value argument produce result time contrast depending may produce different result different time called argument different program state
Eliminating change state depend function input make much easier understand predict behavior program one key motivation development functional programming
Functional programming origin developed investigate function definition
Many functional viewed elaboration lambda calculus
Another declarative programming paradigm based
In contrast change state command simplest example
Imperative programming mathematical sense
They may change value program state
Functions without therefore make sense
Because lack language expression result different value different time depending state executing program
Functional programming language largely emphasized rather commercial software development
However prominent programming language support functional programming also known used industrial commercial application wide variety organization
one world widely distributed language property untyped functional language addition imperative paradigm
Functional programming also supported like statistic financial analysis
Widespread declarative language like use element functional programming especially eschewing
Programming functional style also accomplished language specifically designed functional programming
For example imperative programming language subject book describing apply functional programming concept
This also true programming language
added construct facilitate functional style
The language also offer functional programming ability
An interesting case frequently written functional style presence side effect mutable state place grey area imperative functional language
provides theoretical framework describing function evaluation
It mathematical abstraction rather programming form basis almost current functional programming language
An equivalent theoretical formulation commonly perceived abstract lambda calculus preceded invention
Combinatory logic lambda calculus originally developed achieve clearer approach

presented lecture Can Programming Be Liberated From Style
A Functional Style Algebra Programs
He defines functional program built hierarchical way mean combining form allow algebra program modern language mean functional program follow
Backus paper popularized research functional programming though emphasized rather style associated functional programming
In created initially developed language later language
Also Edinburgh Burstall Darlington developed functional language
NPL based first introduced work program transformation
Burstall MacQueen Sannella incorporated polymorphic type checking ML produce language
ML eventually developed several dialect common
Meanwhile development simple impurely functional dialect Lisp described influential classic textbook brought awareness power functional programming wider community
In developed also called type theory associated functional program arbitrarily complex mathematical proposition expressed
This led powerful new approach influenced development many subsequent functional programming language
The began consensus form functional programming research implementation release ongoing since
A number concept paradigm specific functional programming generally foreign including
However programming language often hybrid several programming paradigm programmer using mostly imperative language may utilized concept
function either take function argument return result
In calculus example function return function
function closely related function function allow function argument result function
The distinction two subtle describes mathematical concept function operate function computer science term describes programming language entity restriction use thus function appear anywhere program entity like number including argument function return value
function enable technique applies function argument one time application returning new function accepts next argument
This let programmer succinctly express example addition operator partially applied one
expression memory
This mean pure function several useful property many used optimize code While compiler imperative programming language detect pure function perform elimination pure function call always library generally expose information thus preventing optimization involve external function
Some compiler add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external function pure enable optimization
also let function designated
looping functional language usually accomplished via
invoke letting operation repeated reach
Though recursion requires maintaining stack recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative language
The language standard requires implementation recognize optimize tail recursion
Tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program compiling among approach
Common pattern recursion factored using higher order function fold unfolds obvious example
Such higher order function play role analogous control structure
Most general purpose functional programming language allow unrestricted recursion make cause unsoundness generally requires introduction logic expressed language
Some special purpose language allow recursion nonterminating computation expressed infinite stream value called
As consequence language fail Turing complete expressing certain function impossible still express wide class interesting computation avoiding problem introduced unrestricted recursion
Functional programming limited recursion constraint called
Functional language categorized whether use evaluation concept refer function argument processed expression evaluated
The technical difference expression containing failing divergent computation
Under strict evaluation evaluation term containing failing subterm fails
For example expression fails strict evaluation division zero third element list
Under lazy evaluation length function return value number item list since evaluating attempt evaluate term making list
In brief strict evaluation always fully evaluates function argument invoking function
Lazy evaluation evaluate function argument unless value required evaluate function call
The usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional language
Lazy evaluation used default several pure functional language including
argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity easing independent implementation producer consumer data stream
Launchbury describes difficulty lazy evaluation introduces particularly analyzing program storage requirement proposes aid analysis
Harper proposes including strict lazy evaluation language using language type system distinguish
Especially since development functional programming language tended use rejecting invalid program compilation time risking opposed accepts valid program compilation time risk used Lisp variant though reject invalid program runtime information enough reject valid program
The use make manipulation complex data structure convenient presence strong type checking make program reliable absence reliability technique like free programmer need manually declare type compiler case
Some functional language based let type depend term
Such type called
These type system decidable type inference difficult understand program
But dependent type express arbitrary proposition
Through program language become mean writing formal compiler generate
While language mainly interest academic research including begun used engineering well
subset written Coq formally verified
A limited form dependent type called GADT implemented way provides benefit dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience
GADT available since version case class proposed addition language including Java C
Functional program assignment statement value variable functional program never change defined
This eliminates chance side effect variable replaced actual value point execution
So functional program referentially transparent
Consider assignment statement change value assigned variable
Let u say initial value two consecutive evaluation variable yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
In fact assignment statement never referentially transparent
Now consider another function transparent implicitly change input x thus
Functional program exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent
It possible use functional style programming language traditionally considered functional language
For example explicitly support pure function
inception
Amrit Prem added support Python well closure Python though Python relegated reduce standard library module
function introduced mainstream language
In lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style
In sometimes used simulate however anonymous class always proper replacement limited capability
Java support lambda expression replacement anonymous class
However presence checked exception Java make functional programming inconvenient necessary catch checked exception rethrow problem occur JVM language checked exception Scala
In necessary lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style C
Many expressible functional programming term example simply dictate use function pattern roughly corresponds
Similarly idea immutable data functional programming often included imperative programming language example tuple Python immutable array
Purely functional often represented different way counterpart
For example constant access update time basic component imperative language many imperative based array
Arrays replaced admit purely functional implementation access update time
Therefore purely functional data structure used language may efficient tool especially persistence required
Functional programming different
The significant difference stem fact functional programming avoids used imperative programming implement state
Pure functional programming completely prevents provides
function rarely used older imperative programming
A traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list
A functional program hand would probably use map function take function list generating returning new list applying function list item
There task example maintaining bank account balance often seem naturally implemented state
Pure functional programming performs task task accepting user input printing screen different way
The pure functional programming language implement using derived
Monads offer way abstract certain type computational pattern including limited modeling computation mutable state side effect imperative manner without losing purity
While existing monad may easy apply program given appropriate template example many student find difficult understand conceptually asked define new monad sometimes needed certain type library
Another way functional language simulate state passing around represents current state parameter function call
On function call copy data structure created whatever difference result function
This referred
Impure functional language usually include direct method managing mutable state
example us managed reference updated applying pure function current state
This kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure function preferred way express computation
Alternative method developed track side effect program
Some modern research language use make presence side effect explicit
Functional programming language typically le efficient use memory imperative language
This related fact mutable data structure like array straightforward implementation using present hardware highly evolved Turing machine
Flat array may accessed efficiently deeply pipelined CPUs prefetched efficiently cache complex handled SIMD instruction
It also easy create equally efficient immutable counterpart
For purely functional language slowdown logarithmic number memory cell used mutable memory represented purely functional data structure logarithmic access time balanced tree
However slowdown universal
For program perform intensive numerical computation functional language slightly slower C according
For program handle large multidimensional functional language designed speed optimization
Immutability data many case lead execution efficiency allowing compiler make assumption unsafe imperative language thus increasing opportunity
may also speed program even asymptotically whereas may slow constant factor however may introduce used improperly
Launchbury discus theoretical issue related memory leak lazy evaluation give practical advice analyzing fixing
However general implementation lazy evaluation making extensive use dereferenced code data perform poorly modern processor deep pipeline cache cache miss may cost hundred cycle
Imperative program environment sequence step manipulating environment
Functional program expression successively substituted reach normal form
An example illustrates different solution programming goal calculating
Printing first Fibonacci number using function Printing first Fibonacci number using closure Printing list first Fibonacci number generator Printing first Fibonacci number iterative Printing first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing list first Fibonacci number generator Printing list first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing list first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style recursive list Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style primitive recursive list Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style primitive recursive list concisely Printing Fibonacci number functional declaration style Printing Fibonacci number functional declaration style using primitive As influenced Haskell others several functional declarative approach problem

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

What difference unit test functional test
Can unit test also test function
Unit Test testing individual unit method function class dependency mocked
Functional Test AKA Integration Test testing slice functionality system
This test many method may interact dependency like Databases Web Services
Unit test tell developer code thing right functional test tell developer code
You read A well explained analogy unit testing functional testing described follows Many time development system likened building house
While analogy quite correct extend purpose understanding difference unit functional test
Unit testing analogous building inspector visiting house construction site
He focused various internal system house foundation framing electrical plumbing
He ensures test part house work correctly safely meet building code
Functional test scenario analogous homeowner visiting construction site
He assumes internal system behave appropriately building inspector performing task
The homeowner focused like live house
He concerned house look various room comfortable size house fit family need window good spot catch morning sun
The homeowner performing functional test house
He user perspective
The building inspector performing unit test house
He builder perspective
As summary Unit Tests written perspective
They made ensure particular method class performs set specific task
Functional Tests written perspective
They ensure system user expecting
A unit test test
What unit behavior
It smallest piece system independently unit tested
This definition actually circular IOW really definition seems work quite well practice understand intuitively
A functional test test independent piece functionality
A unit behavior small I absolutely dislike stupid one unit test per method mantra perspective right
A unit behavior something part method maybe couple method
At object one
A piece functionality usually comprises many method cut across several object often multiple architectural layer
A unit test would something like I call function pas country code return
A functional test would I fill shipping form country code I redirected help page allows pick country code menu
Unit test written developer developer developer perspective
Functional test may user facing case written developer together user maybe right tool right user even user user user perspective
Or may developer facing
describe internal piece functionality user care case written developer developer still user perspective
In former case functional test may also serve acceptance test executable encoding functional requirement functional specification latter case may also serve integration test
Unit test change frequently functional test never change within major release
TLDR To answer question Unit Testing Functional Testing
There two big group Testing
The best illustration I found one source testing small snippet code
It may considered functional testing
When function put together create module standalone piece possibly User Interface tested Module Testing
Once least two separate module glue together come put two piece sub module sub system together see play nicely together
Then integrate module whatever order team see fit jigsaw piece placed together come testing SW whole
This pretty much Integration testing piece together
If OK come build customer asked actually
last stage realise customer wanted sportscar built van
Functional test mean testing function method code
It mean generally testing system functionality I run command line line become reversed perhaps
In contrast single unit test generally cover single case single method return return

Functional testing integration testing
Unit test one test level functional testing type testing
Basically The function system component
This typically described requirement specification functional specification use case
Component testing also known unit module program testing search defect verifies functioning software
module program object class etc
separately testable
According ISTQB test functional Component testing may include testing functionality specific characteristic
memory leak performance robustness testing well structural testing
decision coverage
Quotes The way I think like A unit test establishes code intended code
wanted add parameter b fact add subtract functional test test code work together get correct result intended code fact get right result system
The basic distinction though functional test test application outside point view user
Unit test test application inside point view programmer
Functional test help build application right functionality guarantee never accidentally break
Unit test help write code clean bug free
Unit testing includes testing smallest unit code usually function method
Unit testing mostly done developer understand core function
The main goal developer cover code unit test
It limitation function tested unit test
Even successful completion unit test guarantee correct operation product
The function used part system unit test written one usage
It type Black Box testing testing done functional aspect product without looking code
Functional testing mostly done dedicated Software tester
It include positive negative BVA technique using un standardized data testing specified functionality product
Test coverage conducted improved manner functional test unit test
It us application GUI testing easier determine exactly specific part interface responsible rather determine code function responsible
Unit testing particularly used test product component component specially product development
Junit Nunit type tool also help test product per Unit
solving issue Integration always comfortable get resolved early development
Functional Testing As Testing concerned two main type Testing Test Test
Test test Tester test The product perform quality attribute customer mention quality attribute
Like Usability Security Load Stress etc
The customer already present requirement properly documented The tester task Cross check whether Application Functionality performing according Proposed System
For purpose Tester test Implemented functionality proposed System
AFAIK unit testing NOT functional testing
Let explain small example
You want test login functionality email web app working user would
For functional test like
Should functional test check login invalid input
Eg
Email symbol username one dot one dot permitted appears etc

Generally
That kind testing go unit test
You check invalid input rejected inside unit test shown test
Notice functional test actually unit test
Sometimes functional test repeat testing done unit test different reason
In example use functional test check particular entering invalid input
We want test bad input rejected
That job unit test
usually done developer
The objective make sure code work properly
General rule thumb cover path code using unit testing

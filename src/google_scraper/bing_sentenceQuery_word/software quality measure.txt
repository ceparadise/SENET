In context refers two related distinct notion exist wherever defined business context Many aspect structural quality evaluated analysis software inner structure source code unit level technology level system level effect architecture adheres sound principle outlined paper topic OMG
But structural quality user others acting behalf interact software least prototype partial implementation even interaction mock version made cardboard represents dynamic test version considered prototype
Other aspect reliability might involve software also underlying hardware therefore assessed statically dynamically
Functional quality typically assessed dynamically also possible use static test
Historically structure classification terminology attribute metric applicable derived extracted subsequent ISO quality model also known SQuaRE
Based model CISQ defined five major desirable structural characteristic needed piece software provide Reliability Efficiency Security Maintainability adequate Size
Software quality measurement quantifies extent software program system rate along five dimension
An aggregated measure software quality computed qualitative quantitative scoring scheme mix weighting system reflecting priority
This view software quality positioned linear continuum supplemented analysis critical programming error specific circumstance lead catastrophic outage performance degradation make given system unsuitable use regardless rating based aggregated measurement
Such programming error found system level represent production issue whilst even far numerous programming error account le production issue
As consequence code quality without context whole system described limited value
To view explore analyze communicate software quality measurement concept technique provide visual interactive mean useful particular several software quality measure related component software system
For example represent specialized approach express combine information software development software quality system dynamic
A science mature measurement tool Louis Pasteur
Measuring software quality motivated least two reason However distinction measuring improving software quality embedded system emphasis risk management software quality business software emphasis cost maintainability management becoming somewhat irrelevant
Embedded system often include user interface designer much concerned issue affecting usability user productivity counterpart focus business application
The latter turn looking ERP CRM system corporate nervous system whose uptime performance vital enterprise
This convergence visible mobile computing user access ERP application depending quality software across type software layer
Both type software use technology stack complex architecture software quality analysis measurement managed comprehensive consistent manner decoupled software ultimate purpose use
In case engineer management need able make rational decision based measurement analysis adherence precept attributed others
There many different definition quality
For capability software product conform requirement
commented others synonymous customer value Highsmith even defect level
The first definition quality History remembers Shewhart beginning century Shewhart Kitchenham Pfleeger reporting teaching David Garvin identify five different perspective quality The problem inherent attempt define quality product almost product stated master Walter Shewhart
The difficulty defining quality translate future need user measurable characteristic product designed turned give satisfaction price user pay
This easy soon one feel fairly successful endeavor find need consumer changed competitor moved etc
Quality customer determination engineer determination marketing determination general management determination
It based customer actual experience product service measured requirement stated unstated conscious merely sensed technically operational entirely subjective always representing moving target competitive market
The word quality multiple meaning
Two meaning dominate use word
Quality consists product feature meet need customer thereby provide product satisfaction

Quality consists freedom deficiency
Nevertheless handbook convenient standardize short definition word quality fitness use
Even though quality perceptual conditional somewhat subjective attribute may understood differently different people noted article software structural quality characteristic clearly defined Consortium IT Software Quality CISQ
Under guidance framework CISQ first Director CISQ Distinguished Advisor CISQ defined five major desirable characteristic piece software needed provide
In model Whats need achieved Software functional quality defined conformance explicitly stated functional requirement identified example using analysis part toolkit documented level satisfaction experienced
The latter referred concerned intuitive responsive easily simple complex operation performed useful
Typically software testing practice tool ensure piece software behaves compliance original design planned user experience desired
piece software disposition support acceptance criterion
The dual dimension software quality consistent model proposed divide software characteristic two piece internal external quality characteristic
External quality characteristic part product face user internal quality characteristic
One challenge defining quality everyone feel understand could based extending various description concept quality used business
proposed product quality function much change world better
This interpreted meaning functional quality user satisfaction important structural quality determining software quality
Another definition coined Quality Software Management Systems Thinking Quality value person
This definition stress quality inherently people experience quality software differently
One strength definition question invite software team consider Who people want value software
What valuable
Although concept presented section applicable structural functional software quality measurement latter essentially performed testing see main article
Software quality measurement quantifying extent system software posse desirable characteristic
This performed qualitative quantitative mean mix
In case desirable characteristic set measurable attribute existence piece software system tend correlated associated characteristic
For example attribute associated portability number statement program
More precisely using approach measurable attribute hows need enforced enable whats Software Quality definition
The structure classification terminology attribute metric applicable software quality management derived extracted subsequent quality model
The main focus internal structural quality
Subcategories created handle specific area like business application architecture technical characteristic data access manipulation notion transaction
The dependence tree software quality characteristic measurable attribute represented diagram right characteristic matter user right owner business system depends measurable attribute left Correlations programming error production defect unveil basic code error account total error source code
These numerous issue eventually count defect production
Bad software engineering practice architecture level account total defect consume half effort spent fixing problem lead serious reliability security efficiency issue production
Many existing software measure count structural element application result parsing source code individual instruction Park token Halstead control structure McCabe object Chidamber Kemerer
Software quality measurement quantifying extent system software rate along dimension
The analysis performed using qualitative quantitative approach mix provide aggregate view using example weighted average reflect relative importance factor measured
This view software quality linear continuum supplemented identification discrete
These vulnerability may fail test case result bad practice specific circumstance lead catastrophic outage performance degradation security breach corrupted data myriad problem Nygard make given system de facto unsuitable use regardless rating based aggregated measurement
A example vulnerability repository vulnerability source code make application exposed security breach
The measurement critical application characteristic involves measuring structural attribute application architecture coding documentation displayed picture
Thus characteristic affected attribute numerous level abstraction application must included calculating characteristic measure valuable predictor quality outcome affect business
The layered approach calculating characteristic measure displayed figure first proposed Boehm colleague TRW Boehm approach taken ISO series standard
These attribute measured parsed result static analysis application source code
Even dynamic characteristic application reliability performance efficiency causal root static structure application
Structural quality analysis measurement performed analysis relationship principle standard together define conceptual logical architecture system
This distinct basic local code analysis typically performed mostly concerned implementation consideration crucial activity
The root cause poor reliability found combination good architectural coding practice
This detected measuring static quality attribute application
Assessing static attribute underlying application reliability provides estimate level business risk likelihood potential application failure defect application experience placed operation
Assessing reliability requires check least following software engineering best practice technical attribute Depending application architecture component used external library framework custom check defined along line drawn list best practice ensure better assessment reliability delivered software
As Reliability cause performance inefficiency often found violation good architectural coding practice detected measuring static quality attribute application
These static attribute predict potential operational performance bottleneck future scalability problem especially application requiring high execution speed handling complex algorithm huge volume data
Assessing performance efficiency requires checking least following software engineering best practice technical attribute Most security vulnerability result poor coding architectural practice SQL injection scripting
These well documented list maintained CWE Emergency Center Carnegie Mellon University
Assessing security requires least checking following software engineering best practice technical attribute Maintainability includes concept modularity understandability changeability testability reusability transferability one development team another
These take form critical issue code level
Rather poor maintainability typically result thousand minor violation best practice documentation complexity avoidance strategy basic programming practice make difference clean code unorganized code
Assessing maintainability requires checking following software engineering best practice technical attribute Maintainability closely related Ward Cunningham concept expression cost resulting lack maintainability
Reasons maintainability low classified reckless prudent deliberate inadvertent often origin developer inability lack time goal carelessness discrepancy creation cost benefit documentation particular maintainable
Measuring software size requires whole source code correctly gathered including database structure script data manipulation source code component header configuration file etc
There essentially two type software size measured technical size footprint functional size The function point analysis sizing standard supported International Function Point Users Group IFPUG
It applied early software development dependent line code like somewhat inaccurate Backfiring method
The method technology agnostic used comparative analysis across organization across industry
Since inception Function Point Analysis several variation evolved family functional sizing technique broadened include sizing measure COSMIC NESMA Use Case Points FP Lite Early Quick FPs recently Story Points
However Function Points history statistical accuracy used common unit work measurement numerous application development management ADM outsourcing engagement serving currency service delivered performance measured
One common limitation Function Point methodology manual process therefore costly large scale initiative application development outsourcing engagement
This negative aspect applying methodology may motivated industry IT leader form Consortium IT Software Quality focused introducing computable metric standard automating measuring software size IFPUG keep promoting manual approach activity rely FP counter certification
CISQ announced availability first metric standard Automated Function Points CISQ membership CISQ Technical
These recommendation developed OMG Request Comment format submitted OMG process standardization
Critical Programming Errors specific architectural coding bad practice result highest immediate long term business disruption risk
These quite often depend heavily context business objective risk
Some may consider respect naming convention others preparing ground knowledge transfer example consider absolutely critical
Critical Programming Errors also classified per CISQ Characteristics
Basic example Newer proposal quality model Quamoco propagate direct integration definition quality attribute measurement
By breaking quality attribute even defining additional layer complex abstract quality attribute reliability maintainability become manageable measurable
Those quality model applied industrial context received widespread adoption

Jones control manager application vendor A large body literature appeared past three four decade developer measure various aspect software development use productivity programmer coding satisfaction ultimate end user applying business problem
Some metric broader others
In scientific measurement effort must balance sensitivity selectivity measure employed
Here primarily concerned quality software end product seen end user point view
Although much software metric technology used past applied downstream overall trend field push measurement method model back upstream design phase even measurement architecture
The issue measuring software performance quality clearly complexity compared even computer hardware run
Managing complexity finding significant surrogate indicator program complexity must go beyond merely estimating number line code program expected require
Historically software quality metric measurement exactly frequency software defect bug
The inference course quality software absence bug
So example measure error density per thousand line code discovered per year per release used
Lower value measure implied higher build release quality
For example density two bug per line code LOC discovered per year considered pretty good long way today Six Sigma goal
We start article reviewing leading historical quality model metric establish state art software metric today develop baseline build true set upstream quality metric robust software architecture
Perhaps point attempt settle definition well
Most leading writer topic define subject term assuming reader construct intuitive working definition metaphor computer architecture even earlier archetype building architecture
And course almost everyone
There universally accepted definition software architecture one seems promising proposed Shaw Garlan This definition follows straightforward inductive path building architecture system architecture computer architecture software architecture
As see key word software
Having chosen definition software architecture free talk measuring quality architecture ultimately implementation form running computer program
But first review classical software quality metric see must surrender establish new metric order software
Software quality multidimensional concept
The multiple professional view product quality may different popular nonspecialist view
Moreover level abstraction beyond even viewpoint developer user
Crosby among many others defined software quality conformance specification
However end user agree program perfectly implement flawed specification quality product
Of course talk software architecture talking design stage well upstream program specification
Years ago proposed generic definition quality
He said product must posse multiple element fitness use
Two parameter interest software product quality design quality conformance
These separate design implementation may even accommodate differing viewpoint developer user area
Two leading firm placed great deal importance software quality IBM
IBM measure user satisfaction eight dimension quality well overall user satisfaction capability functionality usability performance reliability installability maintainability documentation availability see Table
Some factor conflict support
For example usability performance may conflict may reliability capability performance capability
IBM user evaluation science
We recently participated IBM Middleware product study usability dimension
It five page question plus interview specialist consultant
Similarly us five Juran quality parameter functionality usability reliability performance serviceability
Other computer software vendor firm may use fewer quality parameter may even weight differently different kind software software different vertical market
Some firm focus process quality rather product quality
Although true flawed process unlikely produce quality product focus entirely software product quality architectural conception end use
IBM Measures User Satisfaction The Naval Air Systems Command coined term TQM describe approach quality improvement patterned management approach quality improvement
Since TQM taken many meaning across world
TQM methodology based teaching quality guru Philip Crosby Edwards Deming Armand Feigenbaum Kaoru Ishikawa Joseph Juran
Simply put management approach success attained focus customer satisfaction
This approach requires creation quality culture organization improve process product service
In many quality guru published specific method achieving TQM method applied government industry even research university
The Malcolm Baldrige Award United States ISO standard legacy TQM movement Software Engineering Institute SEI Capability Maturity Model CMM organizational maturity level represents highest level quality capability
In upgraded Capability Maturity Model Integration CMMI
The implementation TQM many variety four essential characteristic TQM approach follows Total Quality Management made enormous contribution development enterprise application software
Its introduction information technology initiative followed successful application manufacturing service industry
It came IT time redevelopment existing enterprise software
The effort one author introduce TQM internal administrative service sector research university encountered token resistance faculty oversight committee
They objected term total curious dogmatic ground nothing really total practice
As CIO attempted explain TQM faculty IT oversight committee University Pennsylvania name merely phrase identify commonly practiced worldwide methodology
But help much
However persevered new information architecture followed totally
reengineering administrative process using TQM measure
He also designed totally new information system meet university need world began higher education class enrolled student loan set
In IEEE published standard software quality metric methodology since defined led development field
Here begin summarizing standard
It intended systematic approach establishing quality requirement identifying implementing analyzing validating software quality metric software system development
It span development cycle five step shown Table
IEEE Software Quality Metrics Methodology A typical catalog metric current use discussed later
At point merely want present gestalt IEEE recommended methodology
In first step important establish direct metric value numerical target met final product
The factor measured may vary product product critical rank factor priority assign direct metric value quantitative requirement factor
There mystery point Voice Customer VOC Quality Function Deployment QFD mean available determine metric target value also prioritize
The second step identify software quality metric decomposing factor subfactors metric
For example direct final metric factor reliability could fault per line code KLOC target one fault per line code LOC
This level quality Sigma Six Sigma quality would fault per KLOC
For validated metric metric level value assigned achieved development
Table give IEEE suggested paradigm description metric set
IEEE Metric Set Description Paradigm To implement metric metric set chosen project design data collected must determined assumption flow data must clarified
Any tool employed defined organization involved described necessary training
It also wise point test metric known software refine use sensitivity accuracy cost employing
Analyzing metric help identify component developing system appear unacceptable quality present development bottleneck
Any component whose measured value deviate target value noncompliant
Validation metric continuous process spanning multiple project
If metric employed useful must accurately indicate whether quality requirement achieved likely achieved development
Furthermore metric must revalidated every time used
Confidence metric improve time usage experience gained

This aspect quality definitely need tool measure This aspect might also described Technical Debt http kind compromise done account code quality able keep deadline example another aspect might also general also specialized tool help measure aspect product
Let mention Depending definition quality highly subjective therefore difficult measure
As project developed difficult measure How well product meet consumer need
One traditional measure quality bug detection rate
This relatively easy measure somewhat le subjective
It believed relatively fixed percentage bug go undetected
Projects high rate detected bug likely high rate undetected bug
The rate bug detection vary depending technique used skill tester
There variety bug tracking tool used
Most allow track bug count time
Aiming zero bug time may improve overall quality
One method Fix bug first
This may multiple benefit including lowering overall bug rate
You may want categorize bug source Specification Code Test
Expect relatively equal count category
Tracking injection detection phase may help estimate many error remain
Tracking testing methodology used may also useful
Usability may considered part product quality
Unfortunately testing contaminates tester may need source new tester
Software product quality measured metric Quality measure well product serf consumer
If consumer machine quality likely quantifiable measurable
Issues like duty life certified correct answer anticipated question lack defect timing etc relatively straightforward measure many case hard guarantee generally engineering
If consumer human human business quality start well product development measured pirate metric measured series experiment working system registering us feature customer rating monitoring social network usability study alpha test cycle testing feature etc
The development process likewise measured see well serf participant timely delivery sustainable pace flow product innovation simplicity component defect testing product feature testing trending productivity time

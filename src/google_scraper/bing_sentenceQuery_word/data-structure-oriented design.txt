In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace

Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software

Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

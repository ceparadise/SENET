In numerical quantity measure detail quantity expressed
This usually measured bit sometimes decimal digit
It related describes number digit used express value
Precision often source
The number bit used store number often cause loss accuracy
An example would store sin IEEE single precision floating point standard
The error often magnified subsequent computation made using data although also reduced

Accuracy refers correctness single measurement
Accuracy determined comparing measurement true accepted value
An accurate measurement close true value like hitting center bullseye
Contrast precision reflects well series measurement agree whether close true value
Precision often adjusted using calibration yield value accurate precise
Scientists often report measurement express far measured value true value
For example measure cube known cm across value cm cm cm value accurate gotten value cm cm cm precise
Different type glassware used lab inherently different level accuracy
If use unmarked flask try obtain liter liquid likely going accurate
If use liter beaker probably accurate within several milliliter
If use volumetric flask accuracy measurement may within milliliter two
Accurate measuring tool volumetric flask usually labeled scientist know level accuracy expect measurement
For another example consider mass measurement
If measure mass Mettler scale expect accuracy within fraction gram depending well scale calibrated
If use home scale measure mass usually need tare scale zero calibrate even get inaccurate mass measurement
For scale used measure weight example value could half pound plus accuracy scale may change depending instrument range
A person weighing close lb might get accurate measurement baby weighing lb
In case accurate reflects close value standard
A standard accepted value
A chemist might prepare use reference
There also standard unit measurement liter kilogram
The atomic clock type standard used determine accuracy time measurement
There error

description measure
two definition In simplest term given set data point series measurement set said value close quantity measured set said value close quantity measured
The two concept independent particular set data said either accurate precise neither
In field accuracy system degree closeness measurement quantity true
The precision measurement system related degree repeated measurement unchanged condition show
Although two word precision accuracy use deliberately contrasted context
Interestingly field interpretation measurement play central role prefers use term instead accuracy precision bias amount inaccuracy variability amount imprecision
A measurement system accurate precise precise accurate neither
For example experiment contains increasing generally increase precision improve accuracy
The result would consistent yet inaccurate string result flawed experiment
Eliminating systematic error improves accuracy change precision
A measurement system considered
Related term include directed effect caused factor factor unrelated random variability
The terminology also applied indirect value obtained computational procedure observed data
In addition accuracy precision measurement may also smallest change underlying physical quantity produce response measurement
In accuracy also nearness calculation true value precision resolution representation typically defined number decimal binary digit
In military term accuracy refers primarily accuracy fire justesse de tir precision fire expressed closeness grouping shot around centre target
In industrial instrumentation accuracy measurement tolerance transmission instrument defines limit error made instrument used normal operating condition
Ideally measurement device accurate precise measurement close tightly clustered around true value
The accuracy precision measurement process usually established repeatedly measuring reference
Such standard defined abbreviated SI French Système international maintained national United States
This also applies measurement repeated averaged
In case term properly applied precision average equal known standard deviation process divided square root number measurement averaged
Further show averaged measurement closer normal distribution individual measurement
With regard accuracy distinguish A common convention science engineering express accuracy precision implicitly mean
Here explicitly stated margin error understood value last significant place
For instance recording would imply margin last significant place tenth place recording would imply margin error last significant digit unit
A reading trailing zero decimal point ambiguous trailing zero may may intended significant figure
To avoid ambiguity number could represented scientific notation indicates first zero significant hence margin indicates three zero significant giving margin Similarly possible use multiple basic measurement unit km equivalent In fact indicates margin km
However reliance convention lead error accepting data source obey
Precision includes A shift meaning term appeared publication ISO series standard also reflected issue BIPM International Vocabulary Metrology VIM item
According ISO general term used describe closeness measurement true value
When term applied set measurement involves component random error component systematic error
In case closeness mean set measurement result actual true value closeness agreement among set result
ISO VIM also avoid use term previously specified BS different connotation outside field science engineering medicine law
also used statistical measure well test correctly identifies excludes condition
That accuracy proportion true result among total number case examined
To make context clear semantics often referred Rand accuracy
It parameter test
In term interchangeably used
synonym
The validity measurement instrument psychological test established experiment correlation behavior
Reliability established variety statistical technique classically internal consistency test like ensure set related question related response comparison related question reference target population
In common mistake evaluation accurate model compare
This comparison difference precision accuracy
Precision measured respect detail accuracy measured respect reality
The concept accuracy precision also studied context database information system sociotechnical context
The necessary extension two concept basis theory science suggests well centered accuracy defined closeness true value seen degree agreement reading calculated value one conceived entity measured calculated different method context maximum possible disagreement

Page Data obtained taking measurement lead explanation material different property
During experiment factor could affect outcome need controlled
Many people may idea material different property opinion useful supported data
To justify explanation need data support
This data may obtained taking measurement
The table show length sample one type rubber stretched break The measurement depends quality measuring apparatus skill scientist taking measurement
If apparatus faulty scientist make mistake measurement may inaccurate
For data variation within value must small
There always variation set measurement whatever measured
There may small difference composition rubber way measuring apparatus used
In set data measurement slightly different others
The result repeatable meaning time measurement taken approximately value
We say set data reliable

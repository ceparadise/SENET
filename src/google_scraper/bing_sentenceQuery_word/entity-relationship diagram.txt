Draw Entity Relationship Data Model describes content structure data held Petcare
Specify cardinality ratio participation constraint relationship type
To design database system Petcare need draw Entity Relationship Diagram show entity relationship enteritis
The ERD model static relationship amongst information preserved maintained database
The ERD show item data relate statically
First step need define entity database
According requirement Petcare entity involved database system record Petcare information Information pet included type breed sex age owner Information pet owner included name address home telephone number mobile telephone number Information included pet appointment owner pet particular branch Petcare attending veterinary Veterinarian date time appointment
Information veterinary Veterinarian included name address home telephone number mobile telephone number branch report specialize
The outcome appointment included prescription charge made
Next step define relationship entity
The relationship included Participation Constraint Cardinality Ratio
There two type participation constraint named participation
A participation mandatory participation constraint specifies every member entity must participate member another linked entity generalization
A participation optional participation constraint specifies member entity belong member another linked entity generalization
Three type cardinality described Relation two entity linked primary key
M N Relation two entity linked without primary key
It also chance create redundancy error
Therefore better break two relation
M Relation two entity linked primary key foreign key
The relationship Pet The pet raised owner pet owner owner keep pet
The owner also keep difference kind pet
There fore relationship Pet Owner Total one many
Relationship Owner The pet owner would make appointment Veterinarian
In real case owner would make appointment also Veterinarian also handle case
A relational database allowed condition
To solve issue another entity added Owner Veterinarian
The Owner may make appointment visit veterinarian also also without appointment
In order simple database design see also new appointment
Therefore relationship Owner Appointment Total one many
Relationship Appointment appointment created pet owner handled Veterinarian
However Veterinarian may respond special case would handle appointment
Therefore relationship Appointment Veterinarian Partial many one relationship
Relationship Veterinarian On already mentioned Veterinarian would attend one appointment
Also Veterinarian would issue diagnosis
Diagnosis outcome appointment issued veterinarian
The relationship Veterinarian Diagnosis Total one many
According entity relationship design got first ERD The ERD showed logical database design Petcare
The ERD identifies list data element must included database
Fig

The ERD Petcare
Produce resulting normalized table clearly indicating primary foreign key
After complete logical design database draw ERD start physical design database
The first thing create table define need store database
A good database design make content table related entity
In order meet requirement normalization process implemented
The normalization process need step step transform database step specify name called Form UNF First Normal Form Second Normal Form Third Normal Form Normal Form BCNF The step carried normalization
Collect Transform form table first normal form Transform first normal form table second normal form Transform second normal form table third normal form According ERD design requirement Petcare Tables database created also attribute added indentify
PetID attribute also Primary table
Fig

The Form table The table included requested data information requested Petcare
However attribute difference table
The table form table
We need make content table related entity
Therefore normalization process implemented
The first step transforming form table first normal form
The definition first normal form attribute relation functionally dependent upon primary key
According definition first normal form avulse attribute relate primary key create another table attribute
For example table Veterinarian Branch Specialise related Primary key need avulse attribute create another table Branch Specialise
Another table Diagnosis also issue
Fig

Normalized table Fig
Normalized table After process first normalized got First Normal Form table Fig

First Normal Form table The second step transfer first normal form second normal form
The definition second normal form relation first normal form every attribute fully functionally dependent primary key
After second normalization got table Fig

Second Normalized table The definition third normal form relation second normal form every attribute dependent primary key
Because second normalized table already meet equipment
Therefore third normal form
The next step design physical database defining Primary Key Foreign key
This step also defining relationship table
The Primary Key used identify record table
The Foreign Key key attribute link table
The final normalized table detail relationship Primary key Foreign key showed diagram
Fig

Final table design The last step design database define property attribute
The property attribute design coding attribute
A good coding design important good coding design let use easy understand take le mistake input data also determined usability extensibility database
A good coding design meet requirement Uniqueness one value code may applied entity
Expandability must sufficient space entry new item
Conciseness use minimum number character define item
Uniform size format addition prefix suffix
Simplicity simple apply understand
Versatility easy modify change condition
Sortability may code long correlated sortable code
Stability need regular updating costly
Meaningful circumstance useful code reflect characteristic coded entity
Operability code sufficient meet current future need data identification also minimise clerical system resource required operate
Other coding design sequence table create also important table may relation table
We first create table relate table create table relate table
The sequence table create list sequence Data dictionary
According requirement table attribute created detail listed Data Dictionary OwnerID char PK The ID owner char Not NULL Name owner varchar NULL Address owner char NULL Phone number owner char NULL Mobile number owner TypeID char PK The ID pet type char Not NULL name pet type BreedID char PK The ID breed type char Not NULL Name Breed type TypeID char FK relate PetType PetID char PK The ID Pet OwnerID char FK relate Owner PetName char Not NULL Name pet Sex char Not NULL sex pet Age numeric Not NULL age pet Breedid char FK relate Breed BranchID char PK The ID branch char Not NULL Name branch char Not NULL Address branch char Not NULL Phone number branch SpeID char PK The ID specialize Specialise char Not NULL Name specialization VetID char PK The ID veterinaria char Not NULL Name veterinaria varchar Not NULL Address veterinaria char Not NULL Phone number veterinaria char Not NULL Mobile number veterinaria SpecID char FK relate Specialisation BranchID char Not NULL The branch veterinaria working AppID char PK The ID appointment VetID char FK relate Veterinarian OwnerID char FK relate owner BranchID char FK relate Branch PetID char FK relate Pet Date date Not NULL date appointment Time time Not NULL time appointment char PK The ID Drug Type char Not NULL Name drug type DrugID char PK The ID drug char FK relate DrugType DrugName char Not NULL Name drug Category char Not NULL How use drug Period char Not NULL Number day use drug PrescID char PK The ID Prescription char FK relate Drug char FK relate Drug char FK relate Drug DiagID char PK The ID diagnosis VelID char FK relate Velerinarian PrescID char FK relate Prescription Price Numeric Not NULL The price diagnosis Using Database Management System DBMS normalized table populate test After completely designed database start create
Concerning popularity easy use determined use Microsoft Access Database Management System DBMS Petcare database
We use SQL command create table attribute relationship table
The SQL command create table list CREATE TABLE Owner OwnerID CHAR PRIMARY KEY CHAR VARCHAR CHAR CHAR CREATE TABLE PetType TypeID CHAR PRIMARY KEY CHAR CREATE TABLE Breed BreedID CHAR PRIMARY KEY CHAR TypeID CHAR REFERENCES PetType TypeID ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE CREATE TABLE Pet PetID CHAR PRIMARY KEY OwnerID CHAR REFERENCES Owner OwnerID ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE PetName CHAR Sex CHAR Age NUMERIC BreedID CHAR REFERENCES Breed BreedID ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE All table also used similar SQL command create would repeat
After table attribute relationship created
The whole table diagram showed figure
Fig

Tables MS Access After table creation finished
We input test data database test database functioned expended
We would input least record table
The screen showed test data table Fig

Table Owner Pet PetType Breed Fig

Table Veterinarian Specialization Appointment Branch Fig

Table Prescription Diagnosis Drug DrugType test following query using Structured Query Language SQL
In order test database design data input correct need query data form database
The case test database meet Petcare requirement
Display name address branch Petcare name veterinary doctor working branch
Any specialism veterinary doctor also shown
This general query database goal requirement need join Branch Veterinarian Specialization table select requested data
The query statement result listed Fig

Result Query
Display appointment whole Petcare organization
This ordered date
The result display branch appointment name veterinary doctor appointment date time appointment name animal appointment type animal breed animal
Case two difficulty need join Appointment Branch Veterinary Pet PetType Breed total table
The query complex easy make mistake
The query statement query result showed Fig

Result query Explain assumption made analyzing designing implementing Each appointment ID one pet
Same owner bring pet Petcare whould see new appointment
One prescription maximum list drug
Normally drug enough case
If pet issue need drug veterinary open multi prescription difference type drug

need skin medication Painkiller
also see new appointment
In assignment database system PatCare included user interface
The database system used store data DBMS used manager database see bridge Database User interface
DBMS designed user mainly use command line manager database query data
Even new DBMS system MS Access SQL GUI also hard normal user use database query data
In order let user easy use database User Interface must
The user interface let user easy input data update record check record
And also form report user print
The user interface need gorgeous complex
A good user interface simple convenient easy understand easy use
We design web base interface web base interface simple easy manage
The important web base interface need install additional program therefore additional budget buy application

An diagram ERD data modeling technique graphically illustrates information system entity relationship entity
An ERD conceptual representational model data used represent entity framework infrastructure
The element ERD Steps involved creating ERD include An diagram ERD crucial creating good database design
It used logical data model useful developing conceptual design database
An entity item concept exists
Entities equivalent database table relational database row table representing instance entity
An attribute entity particular property describes entity
A relationship association describes interaction entity
Cardinality context ERD number instance one entity must associated instance another entity
In general may relationship
For example let u consider two entity employee department
An employee attribute employee number name department number etc
Similarly department number name defined attribute department
A department interact many employee employee belong one department hence relationship defined department employee
In actual database employee table department number foreign key referencing department table enforce relationship

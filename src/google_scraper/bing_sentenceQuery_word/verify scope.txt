In association name entity region binding valid name used refer entity
Such region referred
In part program name may refer different entity may different binding nothing may unbound
The scope binding also known entity particularly older technical literature perspective referenced entity referencing name
A scope part program scope set binding precise tricky casual use practice largely corresponds function file depending language type entity
The term scope also used refer set entity visible name valid within portion program given point program correctly referred
Strictly speaking practice programming language part program refers portion source code area text known
In language however part program refers portion run time time period execution known
Both term somewhat misleading misuse technical term discussed distinction accurate precise standard respective term
Lexical scope main focus article dynamic scope understood contrast lexical scope
In case name resolution based lexical scope straightforward use implement use one simply read backwards source code determine entity name refers implementation one simply maintain list name context compiling interpreting program
Basic difficulty arise considerably subtler one arise particularly
The strict definition lexical scope name unambiguous portion source code binding name entity applies virtually unchanged definition specification
Representative language specification follow
Most commonly scope refers given name refer given effect also apply entity function type class constant enumeration
A fundamental distinction scoping part program mean
In language also called name resolution depends location source code defined named variable function defined
In contrast language name resolution depends upon name encountered determined
In practice lexical scope variable definition resolved searching containing block function fails searching outer containing block whereas dynamic scope calling function searched function called calling function progressing call stack
Of course rule first look local definition variable
Most modern language use lexical scoping variable function though dynamic scoping used language notably dialect Lisp scripting language like
Even lexically scoped language scope confusing uninitiated depend lexical context closure defined called
Lexical resolution determined also known dynamic resolution general determined thus known
In selects object runtime though whether actual name binding done compile time run time depends language
De facto dynamic scoping common directly name resolution instead expand place
Some programming framework like use term scope mean something entirely different used article
In framework scope object programming language use case AngularJS used certain way framework emulate dynamic scope language us lexical scope variable
Those scope scope using usual meaning term given part program following usual rule variable scope language like object using rule
In context AngularJS sometimes term scope dollar sign used avoid confusion using dollar sign variable name often discouraged style guide
Scope important component turn fundamental
Name resolution including scope varies programming language within programming language varies type entity rule scope called
Together scoping rule crucial change one part program break unrelated part
When discussing scope three basic concept Scope context particular frequently confused scope property identifier fixed context property program varies position
More precisely context property position program either position source code point
Execution context consists lexical context current execution point plus additional runtime state
Thus execution point program variable name scope variable name context meaning context point execution point exit variable name scope returning function variable name go context
Narrowly speaking execution program enters exit various scope point execution identifier context context hence identifier come context go context program enters exit scope however practice usage much looser
Scope level concept property identifier particularly variable function name identifier source code entity program part behavior compiler interpreter language
As issue scope similar type reference used program generally
Using value variable name context variable uninitialized analogous dereferencing accessing value undefined
However variable destroyed go context analog exist
For entity variable scope subset also known name refer variable exists possibly undefined value variable exist necessarily visible variable may exist inaccessible value stored referred within given context accessible via given name case program scope name
In case lifetime irrelevant label named position source code lifetime identical program statically compiled language may context given point program likewise context entire program context within function local context lifetime entire run program
Determining entity identifier refers known particularly varies language
Given identifier language properly compiler interpreter check entity context match case ambiguity two entity name global local variable name name resolution rule used distinguish
Most frequently name resolution relies rule Python LEGB Local Enclosing Global rule name implicitly resolve narrowest relevant context
In case name resolution explicitly specified keywords Python case default rule overridden
When two identical identifier context time referring different entity one say occurring name usually innermost masking name
At level variable known
Due potential masking language disallow discourage masking raising error warning compile time run time
Various various different scoping rule different kind declaration identifier
Such scoping rule large effect consequently behavior correctness program
In language like accessing unbound variable semantics may result similar referring declaration identifier used outside scope generate
Scopes frequently tied language construct determined implicitly many language also offer construct specifically controlling scope
Scope vary little single expression much entire program many possible gradation
The simplest scoping rule global scope entity visible throughout entire program
The basic modular scoping rule scoping global scope anywhere program local scope within function
More sophisticated modular programming allows separate module scope name visible within module private module visible outside
Within function language C allow block scope restrict scope subset function others notably functional language allow expression scope restrict scope single expression
Other scope include file scope notably C function similarly module scope block scope outside function notably Perl
A subtle issue exactly scope begin end
In language C scope start declaration thus different name declared within given block different scope
This requires declaring function use though necessarily defining requires case notably mutual recursion
In language JavaScript Python name scope begin start relevant block start function regardless defined name within given block scope JavaScript known
However name bound value varies behavior name undefined value differs Python use undefined variable yield runtime error JavaScript undefined variable usable undefined value function declaration also hoisted top containing function usable throughout function
Many language especially language offer feature called allow declaration scope single expression
This convenient example intermediate value needed computation
For example return expression evaluates using temporary variable named avoid calling twice
Some language block scope approximate functionality offering syntax block embedded expression example aforementioned Standard ML expression could written
In Python auxiliary variable generator expression list comprehension Python expression scope
In C variable name expression scope known context
As variable name prototype referred may different actual definition dummy often omitted though may used generating documentation instance
Many programming language allow scope restricted known
This began e declaration valid block
today particularly associated language family tradition
Most often block contained within function thus restricting scope part function case Perl block may within function
A representative example use block scope C code shown two variable scoped loop loop variable initialized incremented iteration loop auxiliary variable initialized iteration
The purpose avoid adding variable function scope relevant particular block example prevents error generic loop variable accidentally already set another value
In example expression would generally assigned auxiliary variable body loop would simply written complicated example auxiliary variable useful
Blocks primarily used control flow loop case block scope mean scope variable depends structure function flow execution
However language block scope typically also allow use naked block whose sole purpose allow control variable scope
For example auxiliary variable may defined block used say added variable function scope discarded block end loop might enclosed block initializes variable used inside loop initialized
A subtlety several programming language C demonstrated example standardized since variable declared within body block also within control statement
This analogous function parameter declared function declaration block function body start scope whole function body
This primarily used initialization statement separate loop condition unlike loop common idiom
Block scope used shadowing
In example inside block auxiliary variable could also called shadowing parameter name considered poor style due potential error
Furthermore descendant C Java C despite support block scope local variable made go scope end function allow one local variable hide another
In language attempted declaration second would result syntax error one variable would renamed
If block used set value variable block scope requires variable declared outside block
This complicates use conditional statement
For example Python use block scope one may initialize variable accessible statement
In Perl block scope instead requires declaring variable prior block Often instead rewritten using multiple assignment initializing variable default value
In Python necessary would Perl would In case single variable assignment alternative use avoid block general possible multiple variable assignment difficult read complex logic
This significant issue C notably string assignment string initialization automatically allocate memory string assignment already initialized variable requires allocating memory string copy checking successful
Some language allow concept block scope applied varying extent outside function
For example Perl snippet right variable name block scope due use keyword function name global scope
Each call increase value one return new value
Code outside block call otherwise obtain alter value
This idiom allows one define Perl
Most commonly used programming language offer way create function variable whose scope end go context function return
In case lifetime variable duration function call created function start variable declared destroyed function return scope variable within function though meaning within depends whether scoping lexical dynamic
However language C also provide lifetime variable entire lifetime program variable context inside function
In case static local variable variable created program initializes destroyed program terminates context within function like automatic local variable
Importantly lexical scoping variable function scope scope within function move context another function called within function move back context function return called function access local variable calling function local variable context within body function declared
By contrast dynamic scoping scope extends function local variable another function called moving context defining function end thus local variable context function defined
In language lexical scoping local variable context nested function since within lexical context function lexically nested
A local variable enclosing function known nested function
Function scope also applicable
For example snippet Python code right two function defined
computes square number computes sum square number
For example
Each function variable named represents argument function
These two variable completely separate unrelated despite name lexically scoped local variable function scope one scope lexically separate function thus overlap
Therefore call without altered
Similarly variable named variable limited scope interfere variable named might belong function
In word risk identifier unrelated identifier even identical
Note also name masking occurring one variable named context given time scope overlap
By contrast similar fragment written language dynamic scope calling function would remain context called function scope would overlap would masked shadowed new called function
Function scope significantly complicated function object created locally function returned
In case variable nested function local unbound variable function definition resolve variable enclosing context create function also environment variable must returned potentially called different context
This requires significantly support compiler complicate program analysis
A scoping rule largely particular C scope variable function declared top level file within function entire file rather C declaration end source file precisely internal linking
This seen form module scope module identified file modern language replaced explicit module scope
Due presence include statement add variable function internal context may call include statement difficult determine context body file
In C code snippet function name file scope
In scope name entire module however may structured across various file
In paradigm module basic unit complex program allow information hiding exposing limited interface
Module scope pioneered family language Python influenced Modula representative contemporary example
In language lack direct support module similar structure instead provided class hierarchy class basic unit program class private method
This properly understood context rather name resolution scope though often play analogous role
In case facility available Python module class code organization function conventionally private method choice programmer
A declaration effect throughout entire program
Variable name global scope called frequently considered bad practice least language due possibility name collision unintentional masking together poor modularity function scope block scope considered preferable
However global scope typically used depending language various sort identifier name function name
In case mechanism used avoid collision
The use local variable variable name limited scope exist within specific function help avoid risk name collision two identically named variable
However two different approach answering question What mean within function
In also called variable name scope certain function scope program text function definition within text variable name exists bound variable value outside text variable name exist
By contrast variable name scope certain function scope function executing function running variable name exists bound value function return variable name exist
This mean function invokes separately defined function lexical scoping function access local variable assuming text inside text dynamic scoping function access local variable since invoked invocation
Consider example program right
The first line creates global variable initializes
The second line defines function print echo current value set overwriting previous value
The third line defines function creates local variable hiding identically named global variable initializes call
The fourth line call
The fifth line print current value
So exactly program print
It depends scoping rule
If language program one us lexical scoping print modifies global variable defined outside program print
By contrast language us dynamic scoping print modifies local variable called within program print
As happens language program us dynamic scoping program print
With name always refers le local lexical environment
This property program text made independent runtime language implementation
Because matching requires analysis static program text type scoping also called
Lexical scoping standard language well modern functional language
It also used syntactic semantic relative although different kind limitation
Static scoping allows programmer reason object reference parameter variable constant type function etc
simple name substitution
This make much easier make modular code reason since local naming structure understood isolation
In contrast dynamic scope force programmer anticipate possible dynamic context module code may invoked
For example consider Pascal program fragment right
The variable visible point never hidden another variable name
The variable visible main program hidden variable visible procedure
Variable also visible procedure hide variable
Variable visible procedure therefore accessible either procedure main program
Also procedure visible procedure therefore called main program
There could another procedure declared program outside procedure
The place program mentioned determines two procedure named represents thus precisely analogous scope variable
Correct implementation static scope language trivial requires function value carry record value variable depends pair function environment called
Depending implementation variable become slightly inefficient deeply lexically function used although technique mitigate
Also nested function refer argument immediately local variable relative location known
No overhead therefore incurred using type nested function
The applies particular part program nested function used naturally program written language nested function available C language
Lexical scoping used picked language since
approximates static lexical scoping introduced LISP via device developed working
The original Lisp interpreter early used dynamic scoping descendant dynamically scoped language often adopt static scoping SRFI dynamic static scoping
another language dynamic scoping added static scoping afterwards
Languages like always lexical scoping since influenced idea went although C include lexically
The term lexical scope date least term lexical scoping date least used describe scoping rule Lisp dialect known Muddle
With global identifier refers identifier associated recent environment uncommon modern language
In technical term mean identifier global binding
Introducing local variable name push binding onto global stack may empty popped leaf scope
Evaluating context always yield top binding
Note done binding stack exists type scoping called scoping
Generally certain defined create binding whose lifetime execution time block add feature static scoping dynamic scoping process
However since section code called many different location situation difficult determine outset binding apply variable used one exists
This beneficial application suggests code avoid depending circumstance variable value simply use value according variable definition
This narrow interpretation shared data provide flexible system adapting behavior function current state policy system
However benefit relies careful documentation variable used way well careful avoidance assumption variable behavior provide mechanism detect interference different part program
Dynamic scoping also void benefit
As dynamic scoping dangerous modern language use
Some language like allow programmer choose static dynamic scoping defining redefining variable
Examples language use dynamic scoping include shell language
Dynamic scoping fairly easy implement
To find identifier value program could traverse runtime stack checking activation record function stack frame value identifier
In practice made efficient via use stack pair
Pairs pushed onto stack whenever declaration made popped whenever variable go scope
alternative strategy considerably faster making use associate name stack meaning
This avoids linear search find particular name care taken properly maintain table
Note strategy assume ordering binding one variable practice binding ordered
An even simpler implementation representation dynamic variable simple global variable
The local binding performed saving original value anonymous location stack invisible program
When binding scope terminates original value restored location
In fact dynamic scope originated manner
Early implementation Lisp used obvious strategy implementing local variable practice survives dialect still use GNU Emacs Lisp
Lexical scope introduced Lisp later
This equivalent shallow binding scheme except central reference table simply global variable binding environment current meaning variable global value
Maintaining global variable complex
For instance symbol object dedicated slot global value
Dynamic scoping provides excellent abstraction used way based saving restoring global variable
A possible implementation strategy variable key
When variable accessed key used access memory location code generated compiler know variable dynamic lexical
If key exist calling thread global location used
When variable locally bound prior value stored hidden location stack
The storage created variable key new value stored
Further nested override variable within thread simply save restore location
When initial override scope terminates key deleted exposing global version variable thread
In modern language key example de facto dynamic scope
The macro language transforms source code without resolving name since expansion done place name expanded text resolved notably free variable resolved based expanded loosely called dynamic scoping occurring
The used de facto dynamic scope name resolution
For example macro expand add passed variable identifier later resolved compiler based macro called properly expanded dynamic scope independent macro defined
Properly C preprocessor expanding macro tokenization stage parsing syntax tree name resolution
For example following code macro resolved expansion local variable expansion site As seen one key reason scope help prevent name collision allowing identical identifier refer distinct thing restriction identifier must separate scope
Sometimes restriction inconvenient many different thing need accessible throughout program generally need identifier global scope different technique required avoid name collision
To address many language offer mechanism organizing global identifier
The detail mechanism term used depend language general idea group identifier given name prefix necessary entity referred consisting identifier plus prefix
Normally identifier sense two set scope scope usually global scope qualified identifier visible one narrower scope without prefix visible well
And normally group organized group
Although many language support concept detail vary greatly
Some language mechanism serve almost exclusively enable global identifier organized group
Other language mechanism combine additional purpose allowing identifier visible member group
And language often allow class singleton object fulfill purpose whether mechanism primary purpose
Furthermore language often meld approach example package largely similar namespaces optionally double class programming organizes variable function class organizes class package
Scoping rule representative language follow
In C scope traditionally known particularly variable
C lexically scoped language global scope known form module scope file scope known local scope within function within function scope nested via block scope
However standard C support nested function
The lifetime visibility variable determined
There three type lifetime C static program execution automatic block execution allocated stack manual allocated heap
Only static automatic supported variable handled compiler manually allocated memory must tracked manually across different variable
There three level visibility C external linkage global internal linkage roughly file block scope includes function block scope nested different level internal linkage possible use includes
Internal linkage C visibility level namely source file processed notably including relevant includes
C program compiled separate linked executable library via
Thus name resolution split across compiler resolve name within translation unit loosely compilation unit properly different concept linker resolve name across translation unit see discussion
In C variable block scope enter scope declared top block move scope function called within block move back scope function return move scope end block
In case automatic local variable also allocated declaration deallocated end block static local variable allocated program initialization deallocated program termination
The following program demonstrates variable block scope coming scope partway block exiting scope fact deallocated block end The program output There level scope Variable name used function prototype function prototype visibility exit scope end function prototype
Since name used useful compilation may useful documentation
Label name GOTO statement function scope case label name block scope block switch
All variable intend use program must declared type specifier earlier point code like previous code beginning body function main declared b result type int
A variable either global local scope
A global variable variable declared main body source code outside function local variable one declared within body function block
Modern version nested lexical scoping
lexically scoped using block
lexically scoped
A Java class contain three type variable defined inside method particular block
These variable local defined lower level
For example loop inside method use method local variable way around
The loop variable local loop destroyed soon loop end
also called variable declared within class outside method
By default variable available method within class also class package
variable method declaration
In general set bracket defines particular scope variable top level within class differ behavior depending modifier keywords used definition
The following table show access member permitted modifier
simple variable initialization name resolution rule cause problem widespread use closure callback mean lexical environment function defined used name resolution different lexical environment called irrelevant name resolution
JavaScript object name resolution property separate topic
JavaScript lexical scoping nested function level global scope outermost scope
This scoping used variable function meaning function declaration opposed variable function type
Block scoping keywords standard since
Block scoping produced wrapping entire block function executing known IIFE pattern
While JavaScript scoping simple lexical associated initialization name resolution rule cause confusion
Firstly assignment name scope default creating new global variable local one
Secondly create new local variable one must use keyword variable created top function value variable assigned value assignment expression reached This known declaration initialization hoisted top function
Thirdly accessing variable initialization yield rather syntax error
Fourthly function declaration declaration initialization hoisted top function unlike variable initialization
For example following code produce dialog output local variable declaration hoisted shadowing global variable initialization variable undefined used Further function object JavaScript frequently assigned callback returned function function executed name resolution depends originally defined lexical environment definition lexical environment execution environment called
The nested scope particular function global local JavaScript particularly closure used callback sometimes referred analogy prototype chain object
produced JavaScript using nested function function object
Returning nested function enclosing function includes local variable enclosing function lexical environment returned function yielding closure
For example Closures frequently used JavaScript due used callback
Indeed hooking function local environment callback returning function creates closure unbound variable function body environment closure based nested scope current lexical environment scope chain may accidental
When creating callback based parameter parameter must stored closure otherwise accidentally create closure refers variable enclosing environment may change
Name resolution property JavaScript object based inheritance prototype tree path root tree called separate name resolution variable function
dialect various rule scoping
The original Lisp used dynamic scoping introduced static lexical scoping Lisp family
adopted lexical scoping Scheme dialect Lisp like still use dynamic scoping
For variable Python function scope module scope global scope
Names enter scope start context function module globally exit scope function called context end
If name used prior variable initialization raise runtime exception
If variable simply accessed assigned context name resolution follows LEGB rule Local Enclosing Global
However variable assigned default creating local variable scope entire context
Both rule overridden Python declaration prior use allows accessing global variable even intervening nonlocal variable assigning global nonlocal variable
As simple example function resolve variable global scope Note initialized called error raised even though declared declared
Lexically allowed Python
Here assignment creates new local variable change value global variable Assignment variable within function cause declared local function hence local variable scope entire function thus using prior assignment raise error
This differs C local variable scope declaration entire function
This code raise error The default name resolution rule overridden Python keywords
In code declaration mean resolve global variable
It thus accessed already initialized assignment assigns global variable rather declaring new local variable
Note declaration needed since assign variable default resolving global variable
also used nested function
In addition allowing assignment global variable unnested function also used access global variable presence nonlocal variable For nested function also declaration assigning nonlocal variable similar using unnested function lexically scoped language unlike implementation value free variable determined set global variable R determined environment function created
The scoping environment may accessed using variety feature simulate experience dynamic scoping programmer desire

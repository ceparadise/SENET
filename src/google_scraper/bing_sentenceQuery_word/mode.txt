In design distinct setting within physical machine produce perceived result different would setting
The interface component probably key standard put user typing different mode pressed return regular mode
An interface us mode known interface
Modeless interface avoid making impossible user commit
A precise definition given book An interface modal respect given gesture current interface user attention interface execute one among several different response gesture depending system current state
Page
In Raskin sense according definition interface modal long user fully aware current state
Raskin refers locus attention word meaning place location
Typically user aware system state state change purposefully initiated user system give strong signal notify user state change place interaction occurs
If user locus attention change different area state interface may represent mode since user longer aware
Several example software described using interface mode Modes often frowned upon interface design likely produce user forgets state interface performs action appropriate different mode get unexpected undesired response
A mode error quite startling disorienting user cope sudden violation
Problems occur change system state happens unnoticed initiated system another person user previously using machine time user forgets state change
Another typical problem sudden change state interrupt user activity
In situation easily happen user operation old state mind brain yet fully processed signal indicating state change
A frustrating type modality created mode user find way word find restore previous system state
According one factor contributing crash Modes intended grab user full attention cause acknowledge content present particular critical confirmation user required
This later use criticised ineffective intended use protection error destructive action due
Actually making action reversible providing undo option recommended instead
Though mode successful particular usage restrict dangerous undesired operation especially mode actively maintained user
Modes sometimes used represent information pertinent task fit well main visual flow
Modes also work convention painting tool
Modal proponent may argue many common activity modal user adapt
An example modal interaction driving motor vehicle
A driver may surprised pressing acceleration pedal accelerate vehicle forward direction likely vehicle placed operating mode like park neutral reverse
Modal interface require training experience avoid mode error like
Interface expert came strongly mode writing Modes significant source error confusion unnecessary restriction complexity interface
Later note accident swearing denoted writes colleague James Winter typewriter used typed number Caps Lock engaged
Raskin dedicated book describe principle modeless interface computer
Those principle implemented system
Some interface designer recently taken step make obvious user friendly darkening background behind window allowing mouse click outside modal window force window close design called thus alleviating risk modal error
state advantage modal dialog improves user awareness
When something need fixing better make sure user know
For goal Lightbox design provides strong visual contrast dialog rest visuals
However method may reduce risk inadvertent wrong interaction solve problem modal window block use application normal feature prevents user taking action fix difficulty even scrolling screen bring view information need correctly choose option modal window present nothing alleviate user frustration blundered dead end escape without le destructive consequence
disliked mode sufficiently get personalized license plate car read NO MODES
He used plate early present various car
Along others also using phrase Do Mode Me In year rally cry eliminate reduce mode
Bruce Wyman designer table art exhibition argues interface several simultaneous user must modeless order avoid bringing single user focus
Alternatives mode command recommended possible
HCI researcher argues best way avoid mode error addition clear indication state helping user construct accurate system allow predict mode accurately
This demonstrated example road intersection
A driver may near home assume similar intersection also four way stop
If happens two way driver could proceed see car
Especially obstructed view car could come though hit first car broadside
An improved design alleviates problem including small diagram showing direction stop sign thus improving driver
Modal control best placed focus task flow
For example modal window placed next trigger activation
Modal control disruptive effort made reduce capacity block user work
After completing task mode activated cancel action returning previous state mode dismissed reduce negative impact
In book Jef Raskin championed termed mode kept place constant action part user mode also called
The term composite Latin prefix mean English word
keyboard example quasimodal interface
The application enters mode long user performing conscious action like pressing key keeping pressed invoking command
If sustaining action stopped without executing command application return neutral status
The purported benefit technique user remember current state application invoking command action always produce perceived result
An interface us quasimodes full mode still modeless according Raskin definition
The feature turn quasimode mode serializing keystroke modifier key normal key pressed simultaneously
In case increased possibility mode error largely compensated improved user physical disability

A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

Modem short Modulator Demodulator
It electronic device used access Internet modulates carrier wave encode information transmitted also demodulates incoming carrier wave decode information carry
A modem important piece network hardware allows computer send receive data telephone line cable connection
In simple word device connects computer Internet
A modem Photo Credit Tmthetom Wikipedia Commons The word modem actually made combining part two different word dulator odulator
As suggests modem device modulates demodulates signal encode retrieve information respectively
For starter process adding meaningful information carrier wave transmitted long distance
You see electrical signal containing meaningful information need transmitted long distance added carrier wave
This process mounting original signal carrier wave called modulation
This example amplitude modulation wherein amplitude carrier wave modified proportionally according amplitude input signal
Photo Credit Photo Credit Back old day landline phone primary tool communicate long distance modem came pretty handy gain Internet connectivity using telephone line
In fact without modem would impossible user connect Internet
While computer technology purely digital relies number transmit receive information telephone technology even day partly analog meaning us continuously varying electrical signal transmit information
Now telephone line partly analog lot computer tech laptop desktop etc
purely digital
How make talk exchange information
Simple
Use modem
A modem two plug one connects telephone line cable provided Internet service provider connecting computer WiFi router
Typically two cord connect modem one brings Internet take Internet router computer Photo Credit Simon Eugster Wikipedia Commons Basically modem take digital signal computer add top analog telephone signal modulates transferred telephone line
Since modem sends information telephone line modulating digital signal also need another kind translator help demodulate analog signal receives via telephone line
That modem named modulates demodulates signal
It important note necessarily require modem link Internet also directly plugging Ethernet cable computer
Most modern computer small inbuilt modem draw power motherboard
Notice Ethernet cable rear computer cabinet
You necessarily need modem link internet
This depends ISP provides broadband connectivity user
Your ISP may provide ethernet cable plug directly computer help communicate network digitally without needing modem switch back forth analog digital signal
It noted intend connect Internet wirelessly want get multiple device connected network simple modem enough
In case need different device called router
You might heard term router thrown around lot broadband conversation
A router also referred WiFi router basically device let connect multiple device Internet physical Internet connection
A typical wireless router Photo Credit Flickr A router also let connected device talk local network
Furthermore offer protection individual device connected keeping directly exposed Internet
If want use Internet one device regular modem suffice
However want connect laptop Internet work also want use messaging app phone tablet need modem plus router wherein modem bring Internet house router let multiple device connect
Fortunately modern router combine feature regular modem router mean need two separate device
In fact due increasing popularity router ISPs often provide free router customer subscribe broadband plan

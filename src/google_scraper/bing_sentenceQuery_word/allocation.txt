The memory really
It reserved fixed address program
Nothing allocated runtime
In contrast variable may sit register CPU
Most local variable
Pointers heap zone managed OS primitive thru
So read You may want understand role operating system
Then read
Static Memory Allocation Memory allocated declared variable compiler
The address obtained using operator assigned pointer
The memory allocated compile time
Since declared variable static memory kind assigning address variable pointer known static memory allocation

I trying understand Slab Allocation work different better ordinary paging
I I believe would helpful explanation
Some question I really appreciate help
THanks
I see confused
The diagram bit confusing may actually incorrect
First let think kernel need memory allocator level page
This probably already stuff mostly know I go completeness
Pages typical unit memory operation
When application allocates memory file something like typically get multiple machine page size
There notable exception Windows us virtual memory allocation unit matter page size CPU
Nonetheless let think way
On modern CPU far code concerned flat address space
This actually illusion provided virtual memory system
The OS provides page anywhere RAM possibly RAM case swapped memory file map contiguous virtual address space
The point apart special case operating system perhaps DMA buffer maybe special data structure set boot time oh kernel image operating system kernel probably never manage block RAM bigger page
This simplifies thing enormously mean far page go every allocation deallocation size
It also effectively eliminates external fragmentation macro level
However kernel also need implement data structure need different kind memory allocator
These data structure usually thought collection individual object
object may thread mutex
The size object typically far smaller page size
So example object represents security credential process think user id group id POSIX say might byte whereas process thread might size
Clearly want use whole page small record idea implement allocator top page
The allocation system satisfy many issue allocator reasonably fast including multicore system want minimise fragmentation
But importantly tunable configurable depending kind data structure storing
Some data structure inherently
For example many operating system maintain cache path name filesystem object avoid long chain directory lookup called name cache namei cache
These object needed performance correctness could theory forget whole page full entry memory tight need free page frame quickly
Other data structure could swapped disk memory tight need soon
But want data structure control swapping virtual memory system
Some data structure moved around memory penalty
nobody refers pointer could compact avoid fragmentation needed
So main idea slab allocator page store data structure type
This tick box object page size external fragmentation
Objects type performance requirement semantics
Incidentally similar story allocation
For type object probably okay wait memory immediately available allocate object
An object represents open file might one example opening file expensive operation best time waiting little longer wo hurt much
For type object
object represents event must happen certain time really want wait
So make sense type object say free page reserve request satisfied without waiting
What basically allowing type object allocator configured need object
These allocator confusingly called cache
You allocate one cache per type object
Yes typically implement cache cache well
Each cache store object type
thread structure address space structure
Each cache turn manages slab
A slab page frame contains array object type
Slabs may full object use empty object use partial object use
Partial slab probably interesting since slab allocator maintains free list every partial slab
Full slab empty slab need free list
Objects allocated partial slab first probably full partial slab first try avoid allocating page needed
The nice thing slab allocation allocation policy option well memory semantics tuned kind object
Some cache might retain pool empty slab might
Some might able swapped secondary storage might
Linux three different kind slab allocator depending whether need compactness raw speed
There explains tradeoff well
The Solaris slab allocator see detail squeeze even performance
For start Solaris everything done slab allocation including page frame allocation
This Solaris solution allocating object larger half page size
It manages smaller object nesting slab allocator space
Some object Solaris require complex expensive construction destruction
object kernel lock could partly free
constructed allocated
Solaris also optimises free slab allocation maintaining free list basis ensuring operation completely
To support allocation
array whose size known operating system also cache represent object rather object
FreeBSD example maintains cache unknown object whose size power byte
What I hope see slab allocation flexible framework tuned need different kind data
It compete paging complement although Solaris page frame allocated slab
I hope help
Let know anything need clarification
The idea underneath slab allocator operating system need specific somewhat standard data structure example process PCB semaphore file metadata etc suggest memory usage necessary
The slab allocator algorithm provides stock memory area whose dimension initialization optimized standard data structure
For example see picture exist object well object
However know kernel allocates memory multiple page size
In order avoid time memory waste OS keep different cache pool memory area rapidly allocated upon request cache dimension different every type object structure
However cache directly contain manage memory area even guaranteed reside contiguous memory
They instead divided slab contiguous page memory whose number generally chosen reduce memory fragmentation
It slab reside different object instance whether allocated free
If cache full new slab allocated somewhere primary memory added cache
To sum thing see picture example object OS know kB big
The kernel allocate page memory specifically since would exponentially increase memory fragmentation redirects cache grey box
In cache address indicate physically contiguous area memory slab set box object finally allocated area slab part colored blue among free full analogous memory area slab

This question likely related wanting better understanding local variable stored versus explicitly dynamically allocated variable
Function parameter local variable generally allocated stack
A stack computer term basically linear structure memory information value variable example stored sequentially recently added value end memory structure value also read removed
This allows function call recursively separate copy parameter local variable retained separately call
The variable value onto stack execution begin new set value new call
When function return variable value restored value stack reverse order thus restoring previous value variable
A heap generally used larger data structure memory programmer want explicitly manage
Whenever used C respectively memory request allocated heap coder make sure get freed appropriate time
Whereas stack data usually easy manage compiler allocates free space heap data easy mess often requires manually written code determine get allocated freed
But appropriate want manage large block memory independently scope function
And although memory computer linear level heap le linear way managed maintains pointer different area memory making easier allocate free block memory arbitrary sequence instead strictly reverse order
Stack heap differ following way You use stack know exactly much data need allocate compile time big
You use heap know exactly much data need runtime need allocate lot data
In situation thread completely independent stack share heap
Stack thread specific Heap application specific
The stack important consider exception handling thread execution

In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

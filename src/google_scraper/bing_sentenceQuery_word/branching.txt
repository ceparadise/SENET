A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

The conditional control structure allows program follow alternative path execution
Iteration looping give computer much power
They repeat sequence step often necessary appropriate repetition quite simple step solve computer Colossus conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot flexibility machine conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot

When Algorithm make choice one two thing called branching
The common programming statement used branch IF statement
Algorithms Computer Programs lot like recipe recipe allow cook make choice
If say mix two egg cup flour exactly
But recipe allow variation
Such cooking Grill outside one thing cooking oven inside something else
In computer program algorithm often must choose one two thing depending state program
If grade greater give student A otherwise grade greater give student B etc
The used way make decision program IF statement
The statement look like The else statement shown optional NOTHING done condition false else statement used
For example congratulate good student chastise bad student
Because often break problem several sub path Matlab provides elseif control statement
For example dollar go dollar theater else dollar go regular theater else dollar go Broadway play else dollar buy theater
The code Matlab would look like Only one followed program executed
The actual path code executed based statement true first starting Top Down
The first statement true executed rest even would true ignored
Notice else run together form elseif Matlab two separate word C Java ActionScript
Go figure
There several syntax aware using statement
The listed You put semicolon line condition statement else statement end statement
When writing statement important align indented level
This make reading code much easier person maintain code
Here example good indentation code bad indentation Again proper indentation show help programmer reader code understand purpose code
Think English always indent show new paragraph
It similar purpose
An statement look similar loop statement loop
The code inside block else block executed
If want something happen many time see Here INCORRECT way use ELSE statement I call Backwards else statement
Sometimes want something condition false true tempted write code empty true branch place code false branch
Here pseudocode example nothing done true condition blank exists program code found else part statement
This considered bad programming style I give
Because statement represents true false condition fix remove empty block reversing condition removing else
Often code set assign boolean value variable based condition loop
Such statement transformed remove loop direct assignment conditional expression

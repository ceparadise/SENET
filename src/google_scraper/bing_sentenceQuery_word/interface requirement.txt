Computer science concentrators must take departmental course departmentals independent work
The minimum amount independent work depends whether AB candidate semester minimum BSE candidate semester minimum
Departmental course computer science course level except specific set course department enumerated
There also distribution requirement within departmental course must take least Systems departmentals least Theory departmentals least Applications departmentals
Notice leaf departmentals constrained departmentals unconstrained
BSE candidate independent work signing COS junior year COS senior year
You encouraged one semester independent work second semester independent work may counted departmental
AB candidate junior independent work project full year senior thesis
Numbered course used designate AB independent work
Any computer science COS course level except independent work count computer science departmental
In addition graduate COS course count undergraduate departmentals COS depending content structure
Please ask need use graduate course departmental
However graduate course rarely count special tracked departmentals see list exception
In addition level Math ELE Physics ORF course duplicate COS content Philosophy MAE CHM ECO MOL NEU count departmentals
On occasion special course computational content department may fall category
Note rare course outside computer science department computer science department count ie departmentals
Courses track explore theoretical underpinnings computing system
They use mathematical proof rigorous development area study
take COS COS count theory requirement
Courses track study design implementation foundational hardware software constitute modern computing environment
Courses track treat broad range topic
Some regular course COS departmentals count specific track COS Information technology public policy
COS Special Topics departmental may associated different track track depending content
Other course may also departmentals may count one track depending level content
Check advisor undergraduate coordinator information
Independent work one unique feature Princeton education
Independent project typically arise either idea excites idea put forth professor department
The department maintains wiki
This list good place start looking project advisor
There also general advice finding topic adviser successful outcome
Once project get form located bulletin board outside Computer Science undergraduate office sign along advisor let u know
Your project advisor always COS Independent Work Coordinator coordinate independent work schedule public talk checkpoint requirement
It possible project faculty member another department approval Independent Work Coordinator
If plan attend graduate school CS pursue PhD strongly encouraged take semester independent work end junior year level course area research interest
If narrowed potential area take class core area curriculum
Successful admission top graduate program requires positive letter recommendation CS faculty commonly taking independent research excellent course work

Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace

Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

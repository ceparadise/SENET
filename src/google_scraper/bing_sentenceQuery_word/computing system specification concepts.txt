What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

To make learning list important computer science theory concept explained analogy minimal technical term
It like computer science degree program everyone get understand general concept
Important note Also check getting started programming
Say order Amazon download film collection online time
You want test method faster
The delivery take almost day arrive download completed minute earlier
Great
So tight race
For online shopping number purchased item input affect delivery time
The output constant
We call
For online downloading download time directly proportional movie file size input
We call
From experiment know online shopping scale better online downloading
It important understand big O notation help analyze algorithm
Big O notation represents algorithm
Let assume O O n scenario example
Someone movie theater asks row sitting
You lazy count ask person front
You simply add person answer get current row number
Brilliant right
However person front exactly thing
Finally question reach row answer I row
From correct message incremented one row pas way person asked
Here another example known
A nurse carrying tray box cocoa cup containing smaller image holding thing turn contains even smaller version image
Here
If still get recursion Otherwise continue reading
Let assume leak water pipe garden
You take bucket sealing material fix problem
After see leak much bigger need plumber bring bigger tool
In meanwhile still using bucket drain water
After notice massive underground stream opened
You need handle gallon water every second
Buckets useful anymore
You need completely new approach solve problem volume velocity water grown
To prevent town flooding may need government build massive dam requires enormous civil engineering expertise elaborate control system
Big data describes data set large complex impossible manage conventional data processing tool
Every computer scientist programmer least know Imagine going hiking goal reach highest peak possible
You already map start thousand possible path shown map
You lazy simply time evaluate
Screw map
You started hiking simple strategy greedy
Just take path
After trip ended whole body sore tired look hiking map first time
Oh god
There muddy river I crossed instead keep walking upwards
A greedy algorithm pick never reconsiders choice
This time climbing another hill
You determined find path lead highest peak
However map provided foggy
To make trip easier downloaded hiking app track path taken measure current altitude
You climb hill
Each time take exact path lead highest peak ever recorded somewhere choose
You also randomly choose different starting point known
So linger around area reduce probability getting stuck
The hill climbing algorithm attempt find better solution generating
Each neighboring solution generated based best solution far
It Mount Everest biggest challenge ever faced
Your goal reach summit impractical climb Mount Everest
You one chance
You cautious
Instead always climbing upwards reducing chance taking wrong path
The higher climb lower probability move lower point explore
The example describes yes memoization memorization approach dynamic programming store result previous computation future use
Pararth Shah wrote brilliant analogy long included
P v NP one popular important unsolved problem computer science field
Say I give multiplication question like x The answer
Easy solve right
What I reverse question x To solve assuming seen probably go possible number
We find easily
What I ask Could possibly
You answer right
Just divide
Multiplication easy
Finding original factor number hard
So P polynomial problem
Computer easily multiply super large number without spending significantly computer time small number
NP nondeterministic polynomial problem
Finding factor still fairly easy computer solve number
It impossible computer right
Here important part Are NP problem factorization also P problem multiplication discover efficient way solve NP problem
Are NP problem really hard solve need aha moment brilliant scientist
come efficient algorithm
Or maybe human dumb
Imagine exist machine life posse
They see u like see ant
Our level intelligence insignificant
Solving P v NP problem like solving
So P v NP problem important
If able prove mean solved easily within reasonable computer time
We able cure cancer break password etc
It
P v NP listed Clay Mathematics Institute
million awarded first correct solution

Here excellent video us domino visualize computer perform binary calculation basic fundamental level huge topic includes subfields like
Let say work secretary company A
You answer phone call arrange meeting typing document etc
You always task based priority
Every time phone ring stop whatever task working
Concurrency property program system allow task run time period
Eventually cope job much data entry task
You complain bos happily hire data entry clerk handle data entry task
Parallelism allows task run time provided machine capability
However implementation concurrency concept also introduces potential problem race condition
This happen allow concurrent transaction banking system race condition handled So handle situation
One really simple way mutual exclusion
Now whenever ongoing transaction system lock account involved transaction
This time moment transaction A occurs account locked
You withdraw money ATM
It unlocks transaction A completes
So mutual exclusion solves problem right
Yes nobody want get rejected ATM every time ongoing transaction
Let modify solution little bit
Now let set different priority level different type transaction
Say cash withdrawal request higher priority bank transfer
When withdraw money ATM transaction A bank transfer stop allow transaction B carry first higher priority
It resume transaction B completed
Binary semaphore simple
ongoing transaction
waiting
On hand counting semaphore allows process running time
Let say locker room manager spa
There locker
You keep track number key time receive hand key exactly know
If locker full others queue
Whenever someone done hand key first person queue
Deadlock another common issue concurrency system
Let use banking system analogy different scenario
Just keep mind access bank account locked whenever ongoing transaction
However since transaction completed access locked account
Both wait complete
Deadlock
Here real life example Let approach first
Let approach first
Hacking similar breaking house
Here popular hacking technique Try hundred thousand different key
An experienced burglar try commonly used key first
A attack usually start guessing commonly used password like abcdef etc
A couple moved next door
They really nice helpful
They often invite dinner
One day mentioned going vacation soon
They happily offered take care dog
You left spare key
Since heard news
Social engineering revealing private information
A burglar check every possible entry find easiest way weakness get
Maybe window left open know
A burglar pretend plumber unlock door
He fix leaking pipe everything look perfectly normal
After left discovered jewelry missing
A trojan horse malware program useful helpful run malicious code
Your door lock jammed call locksmith
He fix door lock secretly duplicate another key
A rootkit gain computer various way like social engineering disguise necessary file hard detect antivirus software
Here bookshop analogy
Imagine people visit little bookshop time
Your bookshop occupied others come
You ask leave seem coming group
They probably know
Most seem genuinely interested buy book
Some even ask book shelved
Someone counter pay penny
People keep coming hour
All look perfectly normal
At end day made one book sale
Remember guy pay penny
DDoS attempt bring site service visitor
Cryptography study application secure communication
Here widely used cryptographic protocol Say Alice Bob want send stuff
To make sure nobody see stuff lock box
They make identical symmetric key lock meet share key beforehand
Sharing identical key work fine among people
What Alice want exchange stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff
Alice use lock key shared Bob else Bob unlock box easily
Of course Alice share completely new different lock key Carl Alice want exchange stuff different people
She need keep manage different key
So Alice come brilliant solution
Now maintains key private key
She distribute padlock public key friend
Anyone close padlock encrypt key open decrypt
Now anyone send stuff Alice using padlock distributed Alice longer manage different key different people
If Alice want send something Carl ask Carl padlock public key use lock encrypt stuff send Carl
The basic principle everyone private key decrypt message provide sender public key message encryption

Objects noun method verb
Objects like people
They living breathing thing knowledge inside thing memory inside remember thing
And rather interacting interact high level abstraction like right
Here example If I laundry object give dirty clothes send message say Can get clothes laundered I happen know best laundry place San Francisco
And I speak English I dollar pocket
So I go hail taxicab tell driver take place San Francisco
I go get clothes laundered I jump back cab I get back
I give clean clothes say Here clean You idea I
You knowledge laundry place
Maybe speak French even hail taxi
You pay one dollar pocket
Yet I knew
And know
All complexity hidden inside able interact high level abstraction

This goooooood
Thanks Yash
I actually adding theory right improving explanation stay tuned
Keep posted Very helpful analogy
However Asymmetric cryptography section I think Alice realize brilliant thought find solve initial problem sending stuff Carl people
You mean part distribute padlock friend
The thing asymmetric cryptography eliminates need managing different key different people
Alice need keep one key distributes padlock duplicating
I meant earlier part first paragraph
From I understand Carl send stuff Alice great still leaf Alice unable send stuff Carl Carl lock going help open package Alice original problem
The original problem number key person increase number friend increase
You right Alice send stuff Carl Carl easily send lock Alice Carl need manage single key
The basic idea everyone need manage one private key broadcast public key anyone
If case You remove line What Alice want send stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff I happy
You could also change problem If Alice could receive stuff want maintain separate everybody problem would make sense
Updated

hacking mean cracking Hi carl
The p v np analogy easy solve factoring
Simply find square root divide every number le reach find factor
So instead going test
Obviously know rule factoring divisible number check
odd possibility
No check
And rule factoring multiple sum multiple
The sum multiple
So number test
Hope help
Pay million

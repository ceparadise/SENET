Software production activity also known software development process improving due demand quality increase product
The demand quality cost decrease added introduction new technology naturally force process improvement
Those fact new occurs several production area employ different technique increase development process
In particular software research area involved process improvement Software Engineering Bauer IEEE IEEE
The first model ever employed software development process proposed work segmentation waterfall model
It able allow structured overview software development structure foundation stone propose new process new necessity required
There development model prototyping incremental evolutionary spiral
It interesting observe common point model start Requirements Engineering
Generally speaking Requirements Engineering process identify stakeholder need documenting way make analysis communication subsequent implementation feasible time leading product quality reliability Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The fact Requirements Engineering first activity within software production process better explored analyzing following statement Antoniou et
Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The first statement refers definition purpose inherent characteristic initial activity project research methodology Basili et Solingen Berghout
The second refers meet intended purpose
If software development basis come solution given problem fundamental importance knowledge exact dimension problem solved
Requirements initially discovered project understand basic condition next phase
Thus one get idea importance respect requirement Requirements Engineering occurs initial phase within development process
Requirements engineering activity divided five category Elicitation Analysis Negotiation Documentation Validation Management
These definition alternate among different author Jarke Pohl Sawyer et Graham Kotonya Sommerville Sommerville concept similar Individuals organization involved affected system influence requirement
They could manager supplier customer
The process identification analysis documentation management requirement useful implementation consistent need stakeholder provide software product quality
The main resource used maintain represent traceability relationship
A link establishes explicit relationship two artifact
Technical managerial procedure aid evaluation improvement software development process
The ability define trace requirement artifact throughout development process follow trace direction
A set element describing something built purpose subject particular form analysis
A parallel process support requirement engineering activity identification change management requirement traceability throughout development process

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Tracebility available

A document usually form table used assist determining completeness relationship correlating two using relationship comparison
It often used often consist marketing requirement detailed product matching part detailed design
A requirement traceability matrix may used check current project requirement met help creation various deliverable document project plan task
Common usage take identifier item one document place left column
The identifier document placed across top row
When item left column related item across top mark placed intersecting cell
The number relationship added row column
This value indicates mapping two item
Zero value indicate relationship exists
It must determined relationship must made
Large value imply relationship complex simplified
To ease creation traceability matrix advisable add relationship source document backward traceability forward traceability
That way item changed one easy see need changed

capability trace something
In case interpreted ability verify history location application item mean documented recorded identification
Other common definition include capability implementation keeping track given set type information given degree ability chronologically interrelate uniquely identifiable entity way verifiable
The term used refer unbroken chain comparison relating known
traceable standard used determine instrument bias
It may also used show current interpretation evidence actual evidence legal context history handling information
In many country national standard weight measure maintained National Measurement Institute NMI provides highest level standard measurement traceability infrastructure country
Examples government agency include NPL NIST USA PTB Germany INRiM Italy
As defined NIST Traceability measurement requires establishment unbroken chain comparison stated reference stated uncertainty
A clock providing traceable time standard
The source traceable time
In traceability refers capability tracing good along distribution chain number series number basis
Traceability important aspect example automotive industry make recall possible food industry contributes
The international standard organization ratified standard especially EPC Information Services standard codify syntax semantics supply chain event secure method selectively sharing supply chain event trading partner
These standard traceability used successful deployment many industry wide range product certified compatible standard
In regard traceability refers capability associate finished part destructive test result performed material ingot heat treatment associate finished part result test performed sample melt identified unique lot number material
Destructive test typically include chemical composition mechanical strength test
A usually marked part raw material identifies ingot came lot number may identify group part experienced heat treatment oven time
Material traceability important aerospace nuclear process industry frequently make use high strength material look identical commercial low strength version
In industry part made wrong material called counterfeit even substitution accidental
This practice extends throughout industry using military hardware including industry
In traceability may regulatory ethical environmental issue
Environmentally friendly retailer may choose make information regarding supply chain freely available customer illustrating fact product sell manufactured factory safe working condition worker earn fair wage using method damage environment
In system term traceability refers ability link product requirement back stakeholder rationale forward corresponding design artifact code
Traceability support numerous activity change compliance verification traceback code selection requirement validation
It usually accomplished form matrix created project
Unfortunately practice constructing maintaining RTM arduous time trace tend erode inaccurate state unless stamped
Alternate automated approach generating trace using method developed
In transaction processing software traceability implies use unique piece data order serialized sequence number traced entire software flow relevant application program
Messages file point system audited correctness completeness using traceability key find particular transaction
This also sometimes referred transaction footprint
In fresh produce processing term traceability refers recording mean barcodes RFID tag tracking medium movement product step within production process
One key reason critical point instance issue contamination arises recall required
Where traceability closely adhered possible identify precise exact location good must recalled safe potentially saving million dollar recall process
Traceability within food processing industry also utilised identify key high production quality area business versus low return point production process may improved
In traceability system imply use unique piece data order serialized sequence number generally use traced entire production flow linking section business including supplier future sale supply chain
Messages file point system audited correctness completeness using traceability software find particular transaction product within supply chain
The European Union General Food Law came force making traceability compulsory food feed operator requiring business implement traceability system
The EU introduced Trade Control Expert System April
The system provides central database track movement animal within EU third country
Australia keep track livestock birth slaughterhouse
India started taking initiative setting traceability system Government Corporate level
Grapenet initiative Agriculture Processed Food Products Export Development Authority APEDA Ministry Commerce Government India example direction

Tejas Bhatt The reason shrimp Thailand using slave labor ended reputable company adequate Tejas Bhatt director Global Food Traceability Center IFT
He directs IFT science policy initiative related food
He IFT lead food product tracing pilot conducted Food Drug Administration mandated Food Safety Modernization Act FSMA
Prior joining IFT research associate Purdue Homeland Security Institute
Bhatt bachelor master degree computer science food science Purdue University certified food scientist
He written widely industry publication lectured numerous conference food safety
He scheduled speak June
A major project center guidance document best practice food traceability bakery dairy meat poultry processed food produce seafood
It appeared September issue Comprehensive Reviews Food Sciences Food Safety may accessed
The IFT working area food traceability since conducted pilot FDA
At time realized lot gap traceability implemented food industry
Stakeholders pushed IFT authoritative voice traceability project
Some example work since include development best practice guidance document intended stakeholder food want know art traceability implement
The guidance identified key data element need captured maintain chain product flow
It used industry also target regulatory agency lot coming new traceability requirement
The FDA EU used document development requirement
One key roadblock facing u develop traceability system food produced rate
But participant supply chain principal apply across board
Another project interest packaging industry study seafood traceability handled across supply chain around world harvest retailer
Several thing came extract value traceability moving mindset cost compliance traceability make money business
So often traceability used fined inadequate recordkeeping
This focus solving problem greater good
More information available
I Thailand last year tackle issue slave labor company modify practice
It fascinating
One key thing I learned fact lot people think traceability end case
It tool attempt solve problem
In many way know problem adequate reason shrimp Thailand using slave labor ended reputable company adequate traceability
We talking processor Russia Thailand China talking u
But responsibility rest shoulder Thai processor
It start EU consumer getting vocal demanding safer labor practice better corporate stewardship
The retailer respond need propagate supply chain
I believe company knowingly bought shrimp Thai supplier engaging human trafficking
But inadvertently ended know
If large retailer hundred thousand supplier daunting challenge endorse validate supplier
They system place ensure food safe food traceability extension food safety
We telling know shrimp coming condition harvested packaged know safe
At end day brand name consumer going connect unsafe food product
That hit home lot folk skeptical value traceability
The commonly understood definition identification kind barcodes
In reality certain barcodes label important access information product make meaningful decision key
Often data traceability exist put storage
The benefit around risk mitigation
Regulators without traceability record identify outbreak
Another one market access commonly overlooked
If specialty product want export without traceability ensure get highest value product mislabeled
A third around operational efficiency You reduce waste water use example
If processing tomato track much water used point need clean holding tank
You measure thing
One section FMSA requires new regulation around traceability FDA asks additional recordkeeping food
There lot debate define traced traced
In opinion food traced
We continue see new kind outbreak food lettuce
If always reactive position always behind curve
If deal product
From pragmatic standpoint make sense food
The short answer maybe
What advocating time food transformed transported pretty good tracking event
At certain key data element need captured
We advocating cohesive approach data collection analysis
It add significant cost systematically efficiently
The data work order shipment order need linked data collected processing
Any company handle food required record supplier customer
We say one forward one back
So company know incoming product used outgoing product
Linking crux
There amazing technology I really excited future implement traceability
Depending size company using paper invoice barcodes scanner inline printer
Some company using innovative way infusing inert gas packaging measure along supply chain
Some genetic labeling fingerprinting putting synthetic DNA packaging make sure tampered
I seen prototype consumer smartphone scannable label
We generally advocate electronic capability much easier access
We endorse particular technology feel every industry company unique challenge
We help company ask question let decide technology best

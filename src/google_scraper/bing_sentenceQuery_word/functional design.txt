paradigm used simplify design hardware software device computer increasingly
A design assures modular part device one responsibility performs responsibility minimum side effect part
Functionally designed module tend low
The advantage implementation software module single purpose simpler therefore easier le expensive design implement
Systems functionally designed part easier modify part claim
Since maintenance successful system life feature crucial advantage
It also make system easier understand document simplifies training
The result practical lifetime functional system longer
In system program functional module easier reuse le likely side effect appear part system
The standard way assure functional design review description module
If description includes conjunction design one responsibility therefore likely side effect
The responsibility need divided several module order achieve functional design
Every computer system part functionally pure exist distribute CPU cycle different module
For example system initialization section start module
Other example
Some function inherently mixed semantics
For example function move car garage inherently side effect changing car position
In case mixed semantics extend large topological tree graph related concept
In unusual case functional design recommended authority
Instead procedural method may preferred
Recently several software company introduced functional design concept describe modeling simulation
In context mean object parameter tied design criterion axle adjust diameter based strength material amount force applied simulation
It hoped create efficiency design process mechanical perhaps even assembly integrating result directly behavior individual object

In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In information technology term pronounced number meaning
It taken Latin functio perform
In general use function given
In language programming function named procedure performs distinct service
The language statement request function called
Programming language usually come set canned function programmer specify writing language statement
These provided function sometimes referred
Some function return result requesting program without help
Other function need make request order perform work
In mathematics function relationship two variable called independent variable dependent variable
The dependent variable one value specific value independent variable
A function usually symbolized lowercase italicized letter alphabet followed independent variable parenthesis
For example expression read equal mean dependent variable function independent variable
Functions often graphed usually appear line curve coordinate plane
In hardware device function one complete physical movement discernible consequence relative device purpose
In printer example might carriage return line feed

Cohesion type measurement usually described high cohesion low cohesion
Modules high cohesion tend preferable high cohesion associated several desirable trait software including reliability understandability
In contrast low cohesion associated undesirable trait difficult maintain test reuse even understand
Cohesion often contrasted different concept
High cohesion often correlate vice versa
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured Design cohesion coupling published article book latter two subsequently became standard term software engineering
In method serve class tend similar many aspect class said high cohesion
In highly cohesive system code readability increased complexity kept manageable
Cohesion increased Advantages high cohesion strong cohesion While principle module perfect cohesion consisting single atomic element single function example practice complex task expressible single simple element
Thus module element either complicated order accomplish task narrow thus tightly coupled module
Thus cohesion balanced unit complexity coupling
Cohesion qualitative measure meaning source code measured examined using determine classification
Cohesion type worst best follows Although cohesion ranking type scale rank indicate steady progression improved cohesion
Studies various people including indicate first two type cohesion inferior communicational sequential cohesion good functional cohesion superior
While functional cohesion considered desirable type cohesion software module may achievable
There case communicational cohesion highest level cohesion attained circumstance

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Difference requirement context designing software system
Give example case
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Let elaborate
An example would A related system may The functional requirement relates system functionality
The requirement system
Typically requirement fall area A complete list available Wikipedia entry
requirement sometimes defined term metric something measured system make tangible
requirement may also describe aspect system relate execution rather evolution time
maintainability extensibility documentation etc
functional requirement main thing user expects software example application banking application application able create new account update account delete account etc
functional requirement detailed specified system design acquirement straight forward requirement system rather related usability way example banking application major requirement availability application available time possible
Functional requirement specifies function system system component must able perform
It documented various way
The common one written description document use case
Use case textual enumeration list well diagram describing user action
Each use case illustrates behavioural scenario one functional requirement
Often though analyst begin eliciting set use case analyst derive functional requirement must implemented allow user perform use case
Functional requirement system
It may A typical functional requirement contain unique name number brief summary rationale
This information used help reader understand requirement needed track requirement development system
already explained requirement
I add
requirement requirement functional requirement
This requirement specifies criterion used
requirement form overall property system whole particular aspect specific function
The system overall property commonly mark difference whether development project succeeded failed
requirement divided two main category Whether requirement expressed functional requirement may depend Ex
A system may required present user display number record database
This functional requirement
How update number need requirement
If number need updated real time system architect must ensure system capable updating displayed record count within acceptably short interval number record changing
References activity system must perform Functional requirement related technical functionality system
requirement requirement specifies criterion used judge operation system particular condition rather specific behavior
For example consider shopping site adding item cart browsing different item applying offer deal successfully placing order come functional requirement
Where performance system peak hour time taken system retrieve data DB security user data ability system handle large number user login come non functional requirement
I think client developer side regarding functionality user software developer client
requirement given client provided developer run system smoothly
safety security flexibility scalability availability etc

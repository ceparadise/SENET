Schedule Variance v Schedule Performance Index post Designed help preparing take PMP CAPM Certification Exam post within series present comparison common concept appear PMP CAPM exam
Schedule variance SV schedule performance index SPI two earned value calculation provide measurement project progress project schedule baseline
Earned value measurement may helpful project communicating status identifying potential issue
However earned value analysis technique responds lagging indicator meaning using past performance dictate predict future performance
That always accurate PM must use judgment knowledge interpreting result communicating stakeholder
Schedule variance SV calculated difference earned value EV planned value PV
How much value earned project based budget completion BAC percentage work completed much plan spent point project
SV EV PV hint EV always come first earned value calculation CV CPI SV SPI If negative balance bank account good bad
It bad right
Remember hold true schedule variance well
If negative schedule variance mean behind schedule
A positive SV indicates trending ahead schedule
A variance zero indicates project exactly schedule really happen
Schedule performance index SPI ratio earned value EV planned value PV
SPI EV PV If SPI le one indicates project potentially behind schedule whereas SPI greater one indicates project running ahead schedule
An SPI one indicates project exactly schedule
If subtract SPI see percentage ahead behind schedule
You managing bathroom renovation project
The project budget complete
The project project planned spend per month worth work completed month
You evaluating status end first month
BAC EV PV SV EV PV That good ahead schedule SPI EV PV Indicates ahead schedule The earned value technique may helpful analysis tool still requires knowledge judgment project manager project team interpret result
Schedule variance earned value minus planned value Schedule performance index earned value divided planned value See post Everything need know PMI PMP credential application process various study method exam experience

Building Better Project Managers In project management getting early indication problem silver bullet allows project manager correct problem start
The usually abbreviated SPI one fundamental output
It tell far ahead behind project point analysis usually right
Where For example The Schedule Performance Index represents relative amount task behind ahead schedule
For example task budget schedule performance index would represent task ahead schedule
The underlying Planned Value PV Earned Value EV must calculated task task basis summed determine overall project SPI
It must time point reference word snapshot certain point time
If project currently active schedule performance index changing
To put another way project getting ahead behind schedule time go work go
In order calculate schedule performance index project must initially divided task task must assigned following data This called give project manager something track
one fundamental aspect project management
Also known Budgeted Cost Work Scheduled BCWS Planned Value amount task completed term task budget
It calculated project budget
For example today task supposed last complete
If task budget PV x
Also known Budgeted Cost Work Performed BCWP Earned Value amount task completed
It also calculated project budget
For example actual percent complete task budget EV x
Let say project two task building fence laying sod
The initial schedule baseline Let say
Determine Schedule Performance Index project
Determine percent complete task
Since real project assume task complete respectively
Determine Planned Value PV
Task complete given start end date respectively
Therefore PV x
Task day complete
Therefore PV x
Determine Earned Value EV Task actually complete therefore EV x
Task actually complete therefore EV x
Determine Schedule Performance Index SPI SPI EV PV
The overall project schedule performance index mean work accomplished project plan point
However task SPI mean significantly behind schedule
The Schedule Performance Index usually analyzed conjunction CPI tell far budget rather ahead behind schedule project
The SV similar SPI tell absolute rather relative amount project ahead behind schedule

By In blog post I going discus performance index project cost management Schedule Performance Index SPI Cost performance Index CPI
This blog post fourth blog post series seven Earned Value Management project forecasting
If coming search engine referral I suggest go previous three blog post reading post
Here link blog post So studied schedule variance cost variance
Like variance index also let know health project
They help analyze schedule cost performance project
Schedule Performance Index give information schedule performance project
In simple word Schedule Performance Index tell efficiently actually progressing compared planned progress
Below formula calculate SPI Schedule Performance Index Earned Value Planned Value SPI With formula conclude While calculating Schedule Performance Index make sure consider task
Sometimes may consider task ignore rest cause wrong result
Therefore ensure activity ignored
Given question Actual Cost AC Planned Value PV Earned Value EV Now Schedule Performance Index SPI EV PV Hence Schedule Performance Index Since Schedule Performance Index le one behind planned schedule
The Cost Performance Index indication cost performance project
The Cost Performance Index help analyze efficiency cost utilized project
It measure value work completed compared actual cost spent project
In simple word Cost Performance Index informs much earning dollar spent project
Below formula calculate CPI Cost Performance Index Earned Value Actual Cost CPI With formula conclude Given question Actual Cost AC Planned Value PV Earned Value EV Now Cost Performance Index CPI EV AC Hence Cost Performance Index Since Cost Performance Index le one mean earning USD every USD spending
In word budget
A consistently high low value SPI CPI indication something wrong either planning cost estimate
In case check assumption estimate correctness take corrective action needed
You studied variance index
Now thinking get information set parameter
variance index discard one set parameter
Why schedule variance cost variance taken account schedule performance index cost performance index
There difference variance index
In variance find difference two value index get ratio two value
In cost schedule variance result come dollar form
If number negative say project bad shape
However number positive say project good shape
The problem variance compare health project another project organization many project
Therefore use Performance Indexes compare health project among many project
The Performance Index ratio parameter glimpse ratio sufficient get idea health project
Performance Indexes make easier compare relative health project
Here concept related Earned Value Management EVM complete
In next blog post discus forecasting technique
If interested learning mathematical formula PMP exam try practice PMP exam sample question
image credit Hi
If CPI SPI would expect project end
Let say finished year end instead decleare finish May next year
Also reduction resource way
It seems contradiction av SPI long project still ongoing time amount resource Hello Sitara
Thanks visiting blog
As said CPI SPI I would say condition really bad I say project worst shape something terribly wrong schedule
In case project manager review project schedule network diagram
There must mistake otherwise condition mentioned rare
Let u say schedule OK project manager two option complete project either fast tracking crashing
If manage complete project fast tracking would needing extra money otherwise fresh cost estimation required
Hi Fahad
Good discussion
In case see budget exhausted
So could say fast require additional money case additional resource required complete job
Thanks Ram Since CPI project budget exhausted
How would explain situation CPI greater SPI le
If CPI greater one mean budget
If SPI le one mean behind schedule
These parameter simple telling although spending le money complete work moving slowly
You must speed activity cover schedule delay
hello sir please solve given project detail project
Your company well profit need invest
The money currently saving account earning interest per annum guaranteed next year
You want make profit work harder looked investment opportunity available
They To insulate current company office cost provide fuel saving per year next year

If cost schedule remaining task slip would project perform term cost time
mark Hi Fahad question assignment please ignore perhaps delete
Rashmita I suggest study exam
Regards Jason HAHAHAHAHA I believe someone actually posted
I
budget
create schedule
make WBS area resource load
baseline schedule
get calculation one performance nothing compare
area separated analysis aggregate
calculating CPI SPI value multiply get percentage value
No need multiply number
Thanks lot In blog u said every rupee v r earning cpi doesnt thar mean running budjet dont enough money
It mean budget corrective action taken fund may finish soon
hi u say good excelent
cpi spi
ur answer exellent ru approach
Hello Majid I get question correctly explain
I spi cpi teacher say spi cpi bad
cpi spi bad indicator
approach Alternative cpi spi
Thanks SPI CPI indicator direction project leading
CPI SPI good bad depends condition project
Hi help Exercises cod source Assumed I task day teacher say student must Design gant chart With c text file
Sincerely
Majid Sorry Majid I idea
You say explanation performance index value lie
However CPI SPI value exceed project well
That error Corrected
Thanks pointing
Hi Just question If PV EV AC task calculate SPI work package
SPI Schedule Performance Index
As name suggests SPI calculated schedule individual activity task work package
In case roll activity calculate SPI
These information used Performance Report show progress forecast project management
Management want see whole picture broad level interested seeing status thousand activity hundred work package
Hi Usmani I one question
Whether task type task impact SPI CPI EVM Metrics
example fixed duration task impact SPI CPI differ SPI CPI value fixed unit fixed work

I understand want ask
Can clarify I mean Does task type fixed duration fixed work fixed unit play hand determining CPI SPI value
start project allow determine baseline
work compared baseline
Great explanation Fahad
One question I
If SPI le say course mean behind always mean deliverable met
Can possible project complete deliverable accepted SPI still
Thanks Deliverable met even project behind schedule
It possible complete project spi still project complete work left spi
Thanks Fahad
How possible Fahad Deliverables met project behind schedule
Can elaborate
Suppose working project deliver deliverable interval
And deliver deliverable late say although deliverable met project behind schedule
Still could get
Let u say Project X deliverable
Day Day Day
If I saying Day delivered Day Project behind schedule
But deliverable met
No
Then saying met wrong
In case yes met SPI SPI
And importantly project SPI
No
As Cumulative SPI pull
Or I understanding differently
Yes right
In case proceeding correct direction deliver however delivering deviate schedule delayed
Thanks Fahad
The correct wording would Project delayed SPI however deliverable met NOT
When read first time felt like Project delayed deliverable met meaning case
Btw take CPI case complete Project project delivered delayed delivered
Will different
Regarding CPI need see much earned much spent
Hello CPI SPI benchmark recognized internationally
And You thé RD business
Regards thanks Pierre General understanding say revolve around
Some organization comfortable others
It organization decide benchmark depending risk tolerance
sir Fahad Usmani sb would like send primavera note
I search send I get something
Hello Do think CPI SPI would help determine whether project behind ahead schedule

Yes Schedule Performance Index SPI help determine whether project behind ahead schedule
Hello sir help solving one problem There project A completed day get completed day
And Planned value Actual cost What CPI SPI project
Since project completed mean SPI SPI EV PV Now CPI According question AC PV And This mean CPI Hence SPI CPI equal
Hope help
Yes sir really helped Thanks lot
But sir SPI CPI negative
And sir CPI SPI problem If activity completed day got completed day SPI CPI depends EV PV AC
These ratio negative
Regarding next doubt analyse logic
Thank cal elaborate Can SPI
And second question Is SPI Acc logic
The logic say SPI Mathematically come number get result
Hi When calculating SPI calculated PV complete BAC example six month passed one year duration project way may deceiving sometimes
assumes budget divided equally along month project duration
Would accurate get actual planned amount date use PV
Regards If concept clear deceived
I took simplest example make concept clear
another question please In calculating EV use complete term quantity ex
planned quantity cubic meter reinforced concrete finished month BAC date completed cubic meter EV BAC right accurate
Regards Let u use simple mathematics
The cost cubic meter concreting USD
This mean cost cubic meter concreting USD Therefore cost cubic meter concreting USD Hope help
Why use CPI correctly forecast EAC use SPI correctly forecast schedule completion
There another term called To complete schedule performance index
I understand PMI included PMBOK Guide
Hello congratulation blog
How calculate SPI activity start schedule
I tried cant calculate lower part fraction planned value equal zero
Thanks advance
You need review schedule first
To calculate SPI EV PV hand
I already calculated EV PV example EV PV task begun ahead schedule
Then impossible calculate SPI condition
Yes
Dear Fahad Here example BAC million Project Time month After one month EV million AC million PV million After calculation CPI mean project budget EAC million SPI mean project behind schedule EAC million Now question I relate CPI SPI time duration project month
If I devide time duration project SPI tell u estimated time duration project month case estimated cost would million
Is approach right wrong
If No please explain right approach Yes Can I also use CPI calculate estimated time duration project
And case estimated cost would relative cost
You relate CPI SPI
These two different parameter
CPI tell cost performance SPI tell schedule performance
Dear Fahad Thank much response
Its OK question relate specially SPI time duration
For example SPI mean behind schedule much behind term time duration
The approach I adopted right wrong
devide project time duration SPI estimated project time duration would month
Dear Fahad Thanks reply
Actually I want ask relate SPI project time duration
For example SPI tell u behind schedule question much behind term project time
If I devide project time duration month SPI estimated project time duration would month
Is approach right wrong
You compare actual progress planned progress schedule baseline
This comparison show much lagging
I project CPI SPI
However tracked MSP schedule show variance delay day
Can anybody comment wrong situation project based
The project duration day day passed
Raghu Hi Fahad Quick question
SPI change order added PV suddenly change
Some CO added already complete time added schedule time planned date change order need adjusted otherwise SPI seem calculate properly
Any thought
Thanks Lisa Once change request approved baseline updated calculate PV per current situation
Thanks sharing knowledge started discus lot
regard You welcome Anwar
Dear sir thanks nice article
could please tell PV calculated project delayed
As calculate per initial date PV exceeds budget
Or need make new baseline calculate PV respect delayed date
thanks vpt
You calculate PV based current schedule
If behind schedule recover must change schedule baseline

A parameter
The ratio actual performance planned performance
It generated taking sum budget activity milestone completed data date Budgeted Cost Work Performed BCWS Earned Value EV dividing sum budget activity completed date Budgeted Cost Work Scheduled BCWS Planned Value PV
A ratio le suggests project performed slowly planned behind programme ratio greater indicates project performed faster planned ahead programme
However since SPI unrelated critical path analysis lead distorted picture progress schedule even result work performed order specifically order game SPI
The duration project dependent performance activity yet completion activity critical path lot equal weight depending budget compared activity CP
As result project manager sometimes deliberately seek inflate SPI performing big budget activity float temporarily ignoring critical path activity whose delay extend project duration
The problem corrected
Using separate baseline SPI namely one place SPI baseline critical path schedule activity float delay activity date delay project duration
Refusing give credit earned value performed earlier period scheduled performed

In read range tip suggestion help manage money effective manner
The measure SPI used earn value analysis project explore problem impact scheduled project activity job
It calculated following general formula BCWP BCWP mean Budgeted Cost Work Performed The ratio parameter formula show whether actual value scheduled activity correlate planned value
A higher SPI prof amount actual work scheduled rather efficiently
If measure tends decline work seems planned inefficiently overall schedule likely inefficient well

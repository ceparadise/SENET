Context Diagram Definition A data flow diagram DFD represents complete system
A context Diagram show system boundary external entity interact system relevant information flow external entity system
Search Context Diagram UK US Search Context Diagram rest Computing Students

A context diagram data flow diagram show top level otherwise known Level
At level one visible process node represents function complete system regard interacts external entity
A typical context diagram made two element labeled box represents various entity labeled line show relationship
Information shown context diagram also include classification external entity
This classification show entity interacts influence system whether directly indirectly

In computer science task minimal set data used task may must saved allow task later continued point
The concept context assumes significance case interruptible task wherein upon interrupted processor save context proceeds serve
Thus smaller context smaller latency
The context data may located memory used task used manage task
The storage memory file used task concerned task context case even stored us checkpointing
In computer language like C also concept
For instance needed inside added since version context
Here example code The keyword prevents relocating variable
The access array like
using pointer arithmetic individual element array accessed index

Imagine moment need general understanding automated ordering system
Would helpful could develop view system without getting bogged processing detail
Well system context diagram
It picture worth thousand word


even ten thousand word really big system
You think map system surrounding environment
Drawing context diagram help understand system interacts system business unit key personnel
In addition use help define scope system operation
System context diagram drawn using three diagramming element context bubble external entity data flow
The first diagramming element discus
It drawn circle center diagram identifies conceptual boundary encloses group related process activity
For example could show internal manual automated processing associated ordering system single context bubble
Since context diagram view system specific detail associated internal operation shown
Masking internal structure system operation referred
This concept enables focus identifying understanding behavior data interaction system without distracted complexity internal processing
When context diagram used tool setting scope simply declare operation process scope
If scope include within context bubble
If decide scope place outside context bubble
The scope item constitute second diagramming element context diagram
They drawn box picture stick figure surrounding context bubble adjacent system business unit people governmental agency thing located outside context boundary
Because external entity outside scope system internal processing defined
The key reason show context diagram external entity interact system
Consider following example
You customer external entity order book interaction book store website ordering system
In addition pay purchase another interaction credit card authorized approved interaction credit card company another external entity
Interactions external entity represent either input system output system
Therefore external entity source sink data processed system
Get FREE access day create account
The last diagramming element context diagram drawn labeled arrow represent exchange information system associated external entity
The direction arrow indicates whether flow input output
Each external entity must least one data flow context bubble
Data flow identify data content real object transaction message record document email screen display report
Continuing example book order input data flow actually electronic transaction entered online screen
Likewise credit card payment another input data flow also online transaction
In event received wrong book would send email complaint input data flow system
The system would route email electronic message output data flow customer service department resolution
Since data flow across context boundary always considered within scope system
The information content medium timing data flow define critical interface integration point system external entity
Generally order avoid cluttering diagram irrelevant information show data flow external entity
For example would show book ordered shipped Warehouse even though know event happens
Drawing good context diagram evolutionary learning process
Deciding whether something either inside context bubble scope external entity scope matter judgment
Your decision based reason drawing diagram experience nature system
You may need multiple iteration drawing reviewing revising diagram
Do afraid changing context diagram develop better understanding system
Continue modifying enhancing diagram confident fair representation system
The key criterion judging quality usefulness context diagram ability help others understand system interaction surrounding environment
A powerful tool show view automated system business area
The defines boundary system major interact
External entity business unites people governmental agency thing located outside context boundary
Those interaction represent important exchange information system associated external entity
A system context diagram allows grasp quickly overall operation system within environment
In addition effective mean defining illustrating scope system operation
A system context diagram ultimate view system

Data Flow Diagram available

A SCD defines boundary part system environment showing entity interact
This diagram high level view
It similar
System context diagram show system whole external factor
According Kossiakoff Sweet System context diagram used early project get agreement scope investigation
Context diagram typically included requirement document
These diagram must read project stakeholder thus written plain language stakeholder understand item within document
Context diagram developed use two type building block For example customer place order
Context diagram also use many different drawing type represent external entity
They use representation convey meaning
Decision tree data storage represented system flow diagram
A context diagram also list classification external entity one set simple category Examples add clarity level involvement entity regard system
These category include The best system context diagram used display system interoperates high level system operate interact logically
The system context diagram necessary tool developing baseline interaction system actor actor system system system
Alternatives system context diagram Most diagram work well long limited number interconnects shown
Where twenty interconnects must displayed diagram become quite complex difficult read

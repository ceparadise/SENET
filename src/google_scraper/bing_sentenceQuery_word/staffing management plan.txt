But persistent advance technology changing business perception changed nature IT staffing
No longer viewed bastion esoteric technology IT shop assumed traditional role cost center everyday element business operation contends diminishing budget dollar part organization
Business change also converged technological advance management tool improvement resiliency emergence virtualization
And factor profound effect IT staffing need skill set requirement modern data center
Organizations expect today IT staff le
Because reality scope many IT role expanding often aided advance virtualization technology support many business system without body operate
It common see IT staff tasked backup taking care SharePoint portal system administrator may manage storage well
The change taking place way corporate ladder
Senior management role CIO CTO evolving accelerated rate specific alignment business line manager said Allen Zuk president CEO Sierra Management Consulting LLC technology consulting firm based Parsippany
Although evolution role may sometimes result fewer IT position bright side experienced IT personnel often get spend extra time strategic project
The reality get past initial setup hardening operation managed junior technician said Chris Steffen principal technical architect Kroll Factual Data business information provider Loveland For senior IT personnel mean shift toward supervisory project management position
It trend Steffen see increasing among peer
IT manager ca really afford get rid picture people said
They need people around nothing else compliance reason
Steffen anecdotal observation reinforced data survey Computing Technology Industry Association nonprofit IT trade association known CompTIA
Its survey called Evaluating State IT Skills report number IT employee within respondent organization staying see Figure respondent indicated increase number IT employee
Only respondent indicated decline IT staff
But median number open IT position substantially five open position one open position
The reduction open position likely combination new opening filled open requisition cancelled tendency business hold line staffing level economy show clear sign recovery
Although average number open position may dwindling opening show significant range IT responsibility see Figure technical support application developer
Roughly one quarter respondent open position
There certainly single formula rule thumb staffing modern data center
Staff composition vary dramatically based size organization geographic location industry vertical market actual technology implemented
Still core staffing typically requires number data center operator SAN architect network architect administrator support technician application developer communication engineer
As example Steffen report Kroll Factual Data employ approximately IT professional CIO network operation group five six junior technician two three senior IT staff people technical support
The remaining staff generally comprises application development professional various manager
Those work IT profession typically amount coursework bachelor science degree computer science associate science degree strong technical training may also acceptable
Steffen suggests starting selection baseline certification CompTIA
Although certification demonstrate basic knowledge give prospective junior staffer excellent starting point
At high end expect senior IT administrator engineer posse advanced Microsoft certification MCSE MCSA Cisco certification CCNA CCIE
Steffen said considers CCISP MCIE represent pinnacle IT certification complexity scope certification requirement
There however proliferation IT certification including SANS Institute cooperative research education organization along specialized certification vendor like VMware Citrix well professional certification depending specific need organization
CompTIA research show growing importance certification IT employee
In respondent CompTIA survey emphasized need internal training incentive reward certification
In certification took top spot feedback assessment internal training used method enhance IT skill
Other skill also essential IT professional looking get ahead
Zuk underscore value negotiation management ability tech employee
Broad network data center management experience going significantly important well understanding negotiation agreement ability manage work managed service provider said
Soft skill customer service sale project management communication earned high rating CompTIA survey importance level
These skill considered almost important hardware skill knowledge garnered slightly higher rating
According Steffen staff baseline certification rather set number year experience enhance value job market
IT professional expect show least five year relevant experience
Once door part expectation employee would obtain certification Steffen said
Budget constraint new technology prompting data center look number new alternative reduce dependence employee
Such option particularly attractive small organization business need justify IT project current revenue level simply might allow
Outsourcing routine task managed service provider one well established avenue support core business task website hosting email hosting hosted security
MSPs allow client pay fixed monthly fee needed service without burden managing infrastructure IT staff
In many case MSP us highly scalable process infrastructure allow easily absorb additional client without adding staff
VARs consultant temporary staffing agency offer alternative client bring outside talent perform particular service project usually limited duration limited cost
For example experienced VAR might ideal choice install integrate new server storage system freeing IT staff continue daily routine minimal disruption
Similarly knowledgeable consultant may appropriate compliance auditing expertise lacking internally
VARs consultant effective choice staffing especially need staff augmentation Zuk said
But assumes required talent available timetable meet client need
One emerging trend temporary contract staffing model give client company opportunity hire desirable temp proposition sometimes called try buy
A third option adoption integration automation resource geared toward end user
One example automated password reset freeing IT staff focus bigger project
Zuk said option quickly gaining traction acceptance end user becoming tech savvy
But improper deployment excessive reliance automation tool pose management nightmare existing IT staff
Experts say see little perceptible change IT staffing near future
Virtualization still new broader sense management tool still behind eight ball term support Zuk said
motivated people still play crucial role provisioning management maintenance activity
But staffing change horizon
Ongoing concern global economy tighter business focus IT invariably keep staff count tight
Companies increasingly leverage staffing alternative tackle important IT project
Staffing decision also need clearer consideration critical technology faster introduction new technology data center
People truly succeeding industry stay top technology look work getting experience newest latest greatest Steffen said
CompTIA research indicates security general networking soft skill critical IT professional five year
The need IT service certainly expected wane company may eventually opt trim IT staff position management improves core IT function outsourced MSPs
Conversely company may choose maintain even increase staffing level implement manage new project vital bottom line

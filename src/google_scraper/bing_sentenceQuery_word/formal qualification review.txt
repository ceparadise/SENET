When Shlomo Zippel got first job programming
And pretty much end academic career
I arrangement principal long I showed test well would tell parent I school recall Zippel
Instead getting school bus every morning I got normal bus took office I worked
Zippel lived Israel time developing software used major bank country plus Reuters Israel
At hourly rate Zippel making coding higher parent
My dad surgeon Zippel say
This might say little doctor paid Israel though
The tech world filled famous dropout
David Karp instance ditched high school never graduated
Instead created Tumblr later sold Yahoo billion
Mark Zuckerberg left Harvard University sophomore year mirroring another famous Harvard dropout Bill Gates
Tech billionaire Peter Thiel also vocal critic college famously offering selected student drop college instead focus developing idea
Michael Solomon founder represents coder note many degree major computer science
One biggest issue education technology industry ability keep curriculum current cusp technology say Erik Zuuring programmer dropped college
Just trend technology change monthly basis

But someone want build website SaaS product work startup need point practical understanding
Beyond though deep understanding computer science help become better programmer say Yuri Niyazov Ruby Rails
say
Sure professional experience I asked build another Rails app brings content database browser someone read book probably good I
However time come fix database browser number tool involved process theoretical underpinnings computer science became quite As Danny Sleator professor computer science coach programming team Carnegie Mellon one nation top computer science school acknowledges lot stuff teach may end running might
That may seem faint promise justify cost degree
Not surprisingly many affinity coding opting alternative traditional degree like online course boot camp
The former seem viable alternative except one thing Their woeful completion rate
According SkilledUp people sign online course finish completion
If pay course figure double
Boot camp much higher completion rate
Relatedly demand much bigger commitment
Because require physical presence sometimes move attend
The cost also range high though average lot lower program even pay attend accepted
An exhaustive list dozen boot camp program found
They call boot camp nothing though
Lighthouse instance program day cost
The placement rate going make week year coop position
After salary range Burks say
CodeFellows another boot camp program guarantee job making graduate
Such program viewed entry point junior position work way
Solomon coder make per hour usually five year coding experience
From could course found startup become fabulously wealthy make decent living programmer
However facing graduate top computer science school regardless level coding proficiency may get job offer
The downside going school take time also expensive say Sleator
On hand Our student get lot real plum job
I think easy someone coming boot camp program get job Google

In general computing sense mean process transferring program code data replacing already stored
Overlaying method allows program larger computer
An would normally use overlay limitation lack facility
Constructing overlay program involves manually dividing program block called laid
segment depth level share memory called
An overlay manager either part part overlay program load required overlay destination region needed
Often provide support overlay
The following example show control statement instruct Linkage Editor link overlay program indented show structure segment name arbitrary These statement define tree consisting permanently resident segment called two overlay A B loaded following end
Overlay A consists two overlay segment AA AB
At execution time overlay A B utilize memory location AA AB utilize location following end
All segment root given overlay segment called
As business application intended run platform
A developer platform design program memory constraint exist unless program exceeds available physical memory
Most importantly architect focus problem solved without added design difficulty forcing processing step constrained overlay size
Thus designer use programming language allow programmer much control size

Still overlay remain useful embedded system
Some processor used provide MMU
In addition many embedded system system overlay provide determinate
For example us programmed overlay
Even platform virtual memory may point
In era overlay popular operating system many computer system ran lacked virtual memory little RAM current standard original depending configuration
Overlays popular technique load graphic screen
In order detect overlay already loaded could used
Several DOS linkers supported overlay form nearly identical used year earlier mainframe computer
containing memory overlay de facto standard extension
This file type used among others DOS office automation software package

In part responsible loading
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content containing program instruction memory carrying required preparatory task prepare executable running
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader apart highly specialized computer system fixed set specialized program
typically loader instead code executes directly ROM
In order load operating system part specialized used
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory although operating system support may allow loader located region memory
In case operating system support virtual memory loader may actually copy content executable file memory rather may simply declare virtual memory subsystem mapping region memory allocated contain running program code content associated executable file
See
The virtual memory subsystem made aware page region memory need filled demand program execution actually hit area unfilled memory
This may mean part program code actually copied memory actually used unused code may never loaded memory
In loader
The Unix loader task include In loader function contained following Some operating system need adjust address pointer executable compensate variation address loading start
The operating system need relocating loader program always loaded location address space pointer absolute address rather offset program
Some example IBM mainframe descendant including mainframe
In descendant system privileged operating system facility called IEWFETCH internal component OS Supervisor whereas LOADER application perform many function plus Linkage Editor entirely external OS Supervisor although certainly us many Supervisor service
IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized theoretically possible load relocate entire executable within one revolution DASD medium m maximum m average legacy rpm drive
For load module exceed track size also possible load relocate entire module without losing revolution medium
IEWFETCH also incorporates facility overlay structure facilitates running potentially large executables minimum memory model small KB version OS KB KB common
The OS always resident portion Supervisor formatted way compatible version IEWFETCH
Unlike normal executables OS nucleus scatter loaded part nucleus loaded different portion memory particular certain system table required reside initial KB table code may reside elsewhere
The system application named IEWL
IEWL main function associate load module executable program object module output say assembler compiler including automatic call library language function format may efficiently loaded IEWFETCH
There large number editing option conventional application commonly employed
The load module format includes initial text record followed immediately relocation control record text record followed instance text record relocation control record pair end module
The text record usually large relocation control record small IEWFETCH three relocation control record buffer fixed byte smaller relocation control record certainly possible byte maximum possible IEWL ensures limitation complied inserting additional relocation record required next text record necessary special case sequence record may text record relocation record control record text record
A special byte within relocation control record buffer used disabled bit spin communication area initialized unique value
The Read CCW relocation control record Program Controlled Interrupt bit set
The processor thereby notified CCW accessed channel via special exit
At point processor enters disabled bit spin loop sometimes called shortest loop world
Once byte changed initialized value processor instantaneously know reading relocation control record completed bit spin terminated relocation may proceed synchronously rotation medium relocation occurs gap within medium relocation control record next text record
If relocation text record completed NOP CCW changed TIC loading relocating proceed using next buffer
If channel encounter NOP CCW channel program terminate restarted IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit
The three buffer continuous circular queue pointing next last pointing first three buffer constantly reused loading relocating proceeds
IEWFETCH thereby load relocate load module practical size minimum possible time
another type loader load link like already loaded running program

We recommend upgrading latest
Every overlay consists four component
All run supervision single process
This part responsible UDP communication
Its task send digest receive member
This component identification incoming message happens
Supported message either dispatched either worker forwarded member subscription
If case failure messaging part terminated supervisor restart
Module responsible managing membership
Only member process tracked within module
Every member handled separate process
Every overlay us worker
This overlay us separate set symmetric key iv
To exclude possibility encryption key mismatched overlay us separate encryption module
A gossip member may want subscribe event happening within overlay
This method local application exchange data within overlay
Subscribe unsubscribe packet processed gossip member subscription originate
All subscription managed subscription worker
This component manages subscription information
Every local application subscriber may subscribe presence event
Any member may want send domain specific digest
Any digest included subscribed
Such digest provided either sending custom digest wrapped inside sending REST API call overlay member
Every gossip member share subscription gossip member
Each gossip member store date list subscription every gossip member
When digest arrives gossip member check gossip member expect type digest
All member digest forwarded quality service least delivery
If acknowledgement receiving returned message stay retry state member becomes unreachable maximum number retries reached depending
It important reply event
Please aware message may delivered client

Supervisor mode mode execution device instruction including privileged one performed processor
It thus capable executing operation privileged operation
The operating system computer usually operates mode
Supervisor mode help preventing application corrupting data operating system
Supervisor mode mostly deal interpreting different command capable executing privileged instruction
It full access component system mostly reserved operating system OS since OS routine run supervisor mode
Supervisor mode automatic mode selected computer powered
It allows initial program executed computer mainly bootloader BIOS OS unlimited access hardware
It also mode selected OS kernel task require unrestricted hardware access
Supervisor mode may provide access different peripheral memory management hardware different memory address space
It provides protective barrier application
It also capable interrupt enabling disabling returning loading processor status
Supervisor mode also change create memory address space also access memory address space operation
It also ability access different data structure inside OS

Imagine project manager large smartphone manufacturer iTalk
You assigned work new smartphone development project
Before actual work begin need carry planning project create project schedule
Once project start project schedule used baseline monitor actual project progress planned progress using earned value management
The main aim measure project performance
You start creating hierarchical planning structure break final project product smartphone work package processor chip hardware casing design
You would break work package smaller activity
For example hardware work package include activity produce individual component microphone antenna battery
The next step work creating duration cost estimate activity WBS
When added estimate make project schedule project budget respectively
As attempt estimate different activity duration quickly realize apply method activity different nature
Earned value management distinguishes three different activity type discrete effort apportioned effort level effort activity
In lesson focus discrete effort activity
activity planned measured linking specific WBS output
In earned value management completion rate activity tracked proportion delivered physical output
For example producing battery new smartphone discrete effort activity time required complete task directly linked number battery produced project
In case iTalk need produce battery new smartphones task whole expected take day
In day time would expect battery ready assembly
At point time progress measured counting number battery produced
Because work completed measured discrete effort activity also referred

It important project manager understand able measure physical progress project activity therefore project activity classified discrete effort
Some activity result physical output
Nevertheless included project schedule may critical project success
Examples activity include hardware testing quality assurance visual inspection
While add project deliverable help ensure quality resulting product
hierarchical planning structure help disseminate final project product work package work package separated smaller activity
used measure project performance tracking activity progress
It distinguishes three different activity type discrete effort apportioned effort level effort activity
activity linked certain WBS output
The progress activity planned monitored proportion delivered physical output

As title say Background I pursuing Master degree focus fundamental Algorithms Complexity Computability Theory Programming Languages get good foundation working field Parallel Computing
Some background My university grant lot freedom choice course Master degree
It officially called Software Engineering due broad range elective different focus possible
Interestingly none elective lecture Math
I thinking course Discrete Mathematics would take half semester complete successfully even I ca use degree
So question I trying find effort justifiable
This question appears

As Computer Scientist looking get Master degree focus Algorithms Complexity Computability Theory Programming Languages I would say Discrete Mathematics important
Discrete math help Algorithms Complexity Computability Theory part focus programming language
The understanding set theory probability combination allow analyze algorithm
You able successfully identify parameter limitation algorithm ability realize complex
As far programming language discrete math touch actually program rather used software system design specification
I used ZED university dealing designing system using set theory
I sure percentage software system designed set theory day though
The last important concept grab discrete math boolean algebra
This useful creating logical solution useful programming
Software simply boolean logic
Overall discrete math number class part
It make use brain way class
It logical thinking class must patience computation come easy
I seen people change major could think abstractly enough get course
In short I would make stance discrete math would important class take Computer Engineer
Actually Discrete Mathematics backbone Computer Science I say Theoretical Computer Science
Without The study Discrete mathematics We miss crux Computer Development
It brings rational clarity solution formal way analysing problem
Every field computer science related discrete object whether database Nueral network Computer Organization Compilers Network Programming etc
I would say subject computer science every one study subject

submitted Hey Junior High School
I loved computer year ever since I young love tech
I taking programming class right first real programming I ever done
It independent study I struggle little bit
Any reccomendations
The teacher great self taught
Many people say get used
It python btw
I love I amazing
When I well I love
I also greatest math
IN high school I honor algebra got
Prolly could gotten I reallllllllly pushed getting A non honor geometry
HOw much CS math
Prolly gon na software engineering btw
FInally hard major
I GPA h take honor AP class
furthermore I looking ivy rather school UMD UMBC TOWSON GMU WSU UNCG etc
THanks everyone
The purpose get input whether I possibly major CS Finance
Post comment
The purpose get input whether I possibly major CS Finance
You gon na need math either major
The math take easier understand CS topic
You also work motivation
It really want never get
I want CS
I attracted job opportunity stability salary general interest
I bad math I find extreme math much
Just slight reword said I want money
I attracted job opportunity stability salary
I also general interest CS
Not like thing different really wanting
Looking back day college really pick one cared v one checking box
That said want CS want math could always Software Engineering Computer Security
The CS snob look always life D Thanks reply
I plan SE Doing SE without much CS background limit
Always keep open mind learning
Your ability succeed CS directly correlated NOT I repeat NOT something based financial opportunity
I college right CS I see difference care want money
And really really hard road want money constantly working without paid get paid
College prepare great
You I agree
I feel want job industry enough degree
And degree need lot dedication need really want
Having said Really wanting necessarily something know
I obviously see much difficult choice US money etc
comparison country Denmark example choice somewhat reverted
I understand real love subject around semester degree
I agree many time
You get put college
I would always crank college project day got I could get back fun coding trying new linux whatever computer topic I interested time
CS field many time stare screen matter much experience
One biz guy asked I knew solve problem
I explain since first time I solved problem I know solve
I figure work
For lot people hard thing I love showing work day knowing I going learn something new
What consider extreme math
The kind math encounter computer science curriculum quite different algebra teach high school
I thought I hated math based appraisal calculus I got logic set theory statistic I really got going
That said need grind least two level calculus linear algebra subject felt like pulling teeth get CS degree
Getting degree one thing successful field another altogether
I signed lucrative job offer New York company graduating I CS program I loved sought new challenge
You hear people complain related subreddits CS graduate ca grad actually seek challenge aside school work
Choose major really excite
If mean ditching CS finance say economics much likely find success choking year something hope lucrative
Maybe see math another light apply programming
Algorithm complexity abstract math dealing abstracting pattern programming language help lot writing good fast code low chance error
Regardless computer science math discipline software eng comp eng le
It one hardest major another level compared anything used
Do let discourage use reinforcement really study hard well even pas matter
Unless super genius cramming night acing class
Fellow HS Junior
Everyone I talked say CS basically extension math little I studied totally true
Even sidebar subreddit say Despite popular misconception CS mostly math
Theoretical computer science basically branch discrete math outgrew part academic mathematics department
There stuff generally included heading computer science really mathematical software engineering
Some would argue topic really subject rather included computer science
Everyone able minded person capable getting degree computer science
Some study others
It easiest degree I think hardest either
Make sure study actually show class take note fine
Many people think skip class homework fail thinking hard put solid effort
Many people intimidated degree understand read code debug code challenging
They expect able start writing code day take month year get hang writing code
Do get discouraged pick right away
I tried self teach programming I struggled long time
But studying business school I went back school computer science graduated top class
So get discouraged get easier take work
Read lot tutorial watch lot coding video YouTube
Everyone able minded person capable getting degree computer science
I agree disagree statement
It true sense necessarily take genius get CS degree false sense everyone patience
It really requires develop entirely different way thinking early stage frustrating sometimes feel completely hopeless
At least
Many people intimidated degree understand read code debug code challenging
They expect able start writing code day take month year get hang writing code I somewhat agree
In statement start second paragraph I agree many people get frustrated early degree never programmed
Less people get frustrated English degree read write speak English daily many people read write code daily starting CS degree usually easier time wrapping head around since first time seen
I think anyone practice enough study enough
With anything take practice
Many people get frustrated quit quit stopping
But bring good point
Frustration degree concept brand new discourage many people probably biggest barrier completing degree
deleted Thanks
The major general strenuous major
The amount credit need higher major add difficulty
I give bit experience Sophomore
The introductory class usually quite easy get stressed extremely easily
The people I seen struggle class people never used computer someone different major interest CS need elective
Little math used class likely taking math class along CS class generic class needed like English
The intermediate class hardest IMO
You finally actually start learning computer science program
This challenging I expected pick multiple language week worth time since class focus language rather topic happened use language ie Advanced Data Structures Java
For example learning use generic quite bit different knowing coding syntax math
At time likely finishing math class
For Calc Discrete along CS class
Having many logical topic fry brain may different
Pushing intermediate class seemed hardest everyone
The advanced class bit easier intermediate class
For example I started beginner class teaching Python
My intermediate class taught Advanced Data Structures Java
My advanced class teaching Large Data Structures At point I understand different data structure use matter optimizing algorithm C better implement data structure
The advanced class tend become much group oriented well safety net place
Most people advanced class actually care CS well easy get help
As far math go I take many class
Calc Calc Discrete Linear Algebra Stats course
Math becomes significantly interesting apply application
I used discrete many time dealing large data along stats
Calc feel useless moment I touched anything class since I taken year ago
The advanced go math become relevant
One thing keep mind always going bad CS manner
There always new technology coming sometimes even new language
You constant state learning
You never point I great CS
You seek thrive challenge shy away done attitude
That deciding factor want pursue technology field
Cs math logic said time
However I recommend pulilng one many programming tutorial start learning language I like python get brain around
Then hit get math heavy great CS major centered around CS solve
Just cent Life CS major college different life major
To come term others thread say want
You love work enough wo bother pull get project done put extra effort put together portfolio etc
It time rub wrong way may want consider le intensive major eg Information Technology Software Engineering etc
Those upside cite often come cost
Though experience
Individual mileage may vary
CS math presented different way
In sense still syllabus exclusively programming discover far road advanced math along worded differently
Which pretty cool
That said master craft need advanced math along way
When get far enough rabbit hole need calculus work asymptotic bound understand pro con different algorithm data structure formal logic really get grasp case viewed lens discrete math
Which different
And often formal
And lead understanding formal computing theory
Some niche area CS growth recently machine learning probabilistic data structure etc also require healthy dose calculus linear algebra
But I think dive deeply undergrad
Again cent
Best luck
Edit I posted I caveat saying let formal math requirement scare away something interested
It experience understanding math exposure presented
Just got ok grade one class HS mean good math
It one thing get get keep rolling
The internet great resource
Both CS Finance going require math importantly center around algorithm
I CS degree job field consultant
From view degree field I simply create algorithm process manipulate data
Largely speaking algorithm I use develop formed shaped rule set finance accounting
I never found CS degree hard per say
It set challenge largest challenge faced learning create algorithm efficient effective
Hope help
Dude probably required take calculus course
math actually apply math focused computer course going use
It fun math
Stats computer logic algebra automaton theory funky set theory math
Shit like
That algorithm programing software design
The typical bullshit math course something gota power big dick imagine
Do CS
UMBC good school alma mater
I argue better UMD based knowing former UMD student event
I know anything UNCG CS program list I choose UMBC though
Yeah hard lot math
Push put effort fine
I terrible math I made
College different high school paying someone tend want better actually plan graduating
UMBC SE program CS IS information science opposed CS
I know many people could handle math CS switched IS year two three fine
Edit I graduated little ago CS degree UMBC I currently software engineer Central Maryland
If pay attention homework difficult degree
It IS easy get behind though behind uphill battle
Some major require write paper CS requires write program
The better easier
I recommend trying free online course intro programming something like python
If like like CS
Something like hard way
math like quantum physic hard go easy way
math algorithm level still difficult manageable folk
The university rarely go beyond easy way I actually second semester senior comp sci
For hard actually
Mostly university exercise time management I one weird people show lecture read text absorb lesson
Occasionally run tough problem fun puzzle work
I say really something want get enjoy level otherwise pull hair go insane
Like others said computer science least part come mathematics specifically applied mathematics look completely different horrid calculus prep work math education
However lot university add math requirement
In program I take calc prob stats discrete math part core comp sci requirement
Then I made mistake minoring mathematics Even PhDs computer science churn perfect code may need compile two get program running worry much
I would take look data structure see implement basic one stack queue array list linked list hash table maybe even take stab simpler tree
Then different sort search algorithm list example
Learning CS basically learning speak alot different language need expressed different subset math code rather word order algorithm understand perfectly work
Just like learning two three language either got talent
If start programming year old probably going fit major
I would recommend majoring something le intensive forgiving want work computer Especially money CS major get money intensive career set
You likely work day every week completing algorithm
Not mention CS competitive environment
You also likely get internship starting
Companies may also picky hire likely hire someone talented always someone better
The real good news someone always looking CS major landing job require applied persistence
In theory yes could CS major put work going need prepare fail aloooot
You likely may pas class first second third possibly even fourth time
In short going risking plummeting GPA process
Even succeed going cake walk You likely going balding tearing hair time met newer problem feel like hit brick wall
At time deadline algorithm need completed depending work add lot stress
You may even find going spending time office actually living home
This discourage really think task recommend something fall
Trust CS everyone
It end world
Just put mountain debt finding hard way
I recommend something like CIS people late teen young adult still know programming
Like CS lot application le intensive alot friendly people would want get computer

Since common reason If thinking choosing computer science wanted game designer There alot simpler way making game side focus career provide decent living even need degree make game lot dedication patient
NP Hard least
You luck
I happen experience answer question quite well
My educational qualification GPA HS I BA philosophy GPA I followed MS Finance GPA went back school second BS Computer Science GPA I going second MS CS
At undergrad level neither CS Finance require incredible mathematical capability
You likely take Calc regardless major choose CS also take Linear Algebra
Real math view heavy theorem proof
The CS side thing opportunity dive CS concerned understanding computation application theoretical level
Finance undergraduate level hand interested practical application
You likely wo get math heavy course unless take graduate course finance Derivatives financial contract type Investment Theory
Everything else pretty low level though need comfortable Algebra
To reiterate At undergraduate level neither requires much math
You fluent Algebra
You take Calculus seems daunting bad CS likely take Linear Algebra
CS challenging opinion Finance I put significantly work practice fun I enjoy
If attracted thing like Artificial Intelligence theoretical understanding math heavy
Note I went CS without prior programming ability
As Finance understanding sphere come relatively easily
YMMV Your educational history amazing
I curious though go back school second BS Computer Science
From I heard school tend accept student already bachelor
Although could I mostly looking public school California
Thanks
Yeah I took liberty calling second bachelor technically certificate mean I take core major class including linear algebra requirement etc retake silly
So took year instead full
Good point
I agree CS wo need higher math understand fully get I feel good theoretical understanding proof theorem valuable
The Linear Algebra course I took university Denmark much rooted theorem proof I feel essential understanding logic computational theory CS
Things like Algebra
Group Theory also importan want good understanding cryptography later
Take note grain salt though I suppose experience third year student Denmark may comparable LoveOfProfit response

The class two type homework
Some early homework explicitly group homework assigned random classmate work submit one solution entire group three receive grade
For homework follow Gilligan Island rule
You allowed collaborate classmate group three student
However take memento away collaboration meeting
No paper note note laptop photograph etc
Your writeup entirely look writeups classmate either group others
You also mark clearly name classmate collaborated
Between group meeting beginning writeup let least one hour elapse pursue activity entirely unrelated class watching Gilligan Island hence name
If need hint problem instructor TAs sherpa help
It never appropriate search online book etc
solution homework question try pas work

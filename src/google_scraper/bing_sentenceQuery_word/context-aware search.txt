In computer science task minimal set data used task may must saved allow task later continued point
The concept context assumes significance case interruptible task wherein upon interrupted processor save context proceeds serve
Thus smaller context smaller latency
The context data may located memory used task used manage task
The storage memory file used task concerned task context case even stored us checkpointing
In computer language like C also concept
For instance needed inside added since version context
Here example code The keyword prevents relocating variable
The access array like
using pointer arithmetic individual element array accessed index

property defined complementarily
Whereas location may determine certain process around contributing device operate context may applied flexibly mobile user especially user
Context awareness originated term pervasive computing sought deal linking change environment computer system otherwise static
The term also applied business theory relation issue
Various categorization context proposed past
Dey Abowd distinguish context type
Kaltz et al
identified category cover broad variety mobile web scenario
They emphasize yet classical modality optimal categorization depends much application domain use case
Beyond advanced modality may apply single entity addressed also cluster entity work coherence context
team work also single bearer multiplicity appliance
Some classical understanding context business process derived definition AAA application following three category three term including additionally location time stated
In computer science refers idea computer sense react based environment
Devices may information circumstance able operate based rule intelligent stimulus react accordingly
The term ubiquitous computing introduced Schilit
device may also try make assumption user current situation
define context information used characterize situation entity
While computer science community initially perceived context matter user location Dey discus last year notion considered simply state part process user involved thus sophisticated general context model proposed see survey support application use adapt interface b tailor set data c increase precision information retrieval discover service e make user interaction implicit f build smart environment
For example mobile phone may know currently meeting room user sat
The phone may conclude user currently meeting reject unimportant call
system concerned acquisition context
using sensor perceive situation abstraction understanding context
matching perceived sensory stimulus context application behaviour based recognized context
triggering action based context
As user activity location crucial many application context awareness focused deeply research field
Context awareness regarded enabling technology ubiquitous computing system
Context awareness used design innovative often used part
It also beginning felt internet advent
Schmidt Beigl Gellersen define two important aspect relating computer science
More recently much work also done ease Bellavista Corradi Fanelli Foschini survey several middleware solution designed transparently implement context management provisioning mobile system
Grifoni Ferri provided review several service system using big data analysing methodological practical choice developer made main phase context awareness process
context acquisition context representation context reasoning adaptation
Perera Zaslavsky Christen Georgakopoulos performed comprehensive survey computing Internet Things perspective reviewing leading project field
Further Perera also surveyed large number industrial product existing IoT marketplace computing perspective
Their survey intended serve guideline conceptual framework product development research IoT paradigm
The evaluation done using theoretical framework developed Dey Abowd decade ago
The combination Internet emerging technology transform everyday object smart object understand react context
Human factor related context structured three category information user knowledge habit emotional state biophysiological condition user social environment others social interaction group dynamic user task spontaneous activity engaged task general goal
Likewise context related physical environment structured three category location absolute position relative position infrastructure surrounding resource computation communication task performance physical condition noise light pressure air quality
Context awareness applied area CSCW help individual work collaborate efficiently
Since early researcher developed large number software hardware system collect contextual information location video feed away status message user
This information openly shared user thereby improving situational awareness allowing identify natural opportunity interact
In early day computing many system developed purpose specifically designed assist business geographically separated work team collaborate shared document work artifact
More recently however growing body work demonstrates technique also applied group friend family member help keep apprised activity
To date system use context awareness improve situational awareness characterised The common context obtain share purpose improving situational awareness user location
In early prototype Active Badge system example user uniquely identifying badge could tracked via series overhead infrared sensor
As user walked throughout building location constantly monitored centralized server
Other user could view information either text form map done later work determine user office thereby allowing determine best time stop unplanned conversation
Location also shared PeopleTones Serendipity Group Interaction Support Systems help user determine near friend user shared personal interest teammate respectively
In comparison Active Badge display location information system proactive alert user proximity
This let user know potential interaction opportunity available thereby increasing chance taking advantage
Another popular context share user work activity often sharing video
In Community Bar system researcher developed desktop application periodically took screenshots user display
This information shared user could know teammate working provided common frame reference user could n talk artifact collocated
In Montage user given ability remotely activate webcam another user computer brief amount time
This capability glance another user let user see busy preoccupied turn help better determine opportune time initiate conversation
A third type context share improve enhance situational awareness user audio
In Thunderwire system researcher developed medium space allowed friend share raw audio mobile device microphone
This system essence perpetual allowed user listen user audio order determine participating conversation
The WatchMe ListenIn system also rely heavily audio order determine user potentially interruptible
Unlike Thunderwire however system rely machine learning algorithm order analyze user audio determine user talking
This allows system provide user context whether user conversation without share actual audio thereby making privacy centric
A fourth type context commonly shared user overall activity
In Hubbub Conchat system researcher developed series instant messenger application monitored user active idle using either software environmental sensor respectively
This information could provided user let know friend available respond message
In Digital Family Portrait system researcher developed digital picture frame provides qualitative visualization user elderly daily activity
This visualization provided user adult child could check parent without explicitly bother thereby allowing age place
Although system demonstrate context awareness used support situational social awareness long term effectiveness system yet fully understood
Many system described evaluated conceptual level demonstrate system technically feasible
Consequently initial result study suggest context awareness support situational awareness task longitudinal data required
mobile best suited host implementing application
Modern integrated voice data communication equips hospital staff smart phone communicate vocally preferably look next task executed capture next report noted
However attempt support staff approach hampered till failure acceptance need look upon new event patient identity order list work schedule
Hence well suited solution get rid manual interaction tiny screen therefore serf user mobile agent well suited host implementing newer application relation new paradigm
Modern integrated voice data communication equips workshop production line staff smart phone communicate data production control feedback data originates detecting identifying component part get integrated flexible production management product
However attempt support staff approach hampered fixed production schedule unless information customer demand product configuration matched part supply
Hence well suited solution get rid missing interaction production plan production line occurrence relevant information material mean The key requirement implement solution free manual interaction worker information handling
Otherwise error rate rise rise information requirement
Additionally none conventional RFID WLAN RTLS locating solution advertising precise locating serve required quality determining location conventional attitude looking absolute coordinate fails either technically economically
Other approach based promise better return investment
A leveraging sensed human context adapt game system behavior
By blending real virtual element enabling user physically interact surroundings play people become fully involved attain better gaming experience
For example pervasive game us context human activity location reported
Museums archaeological site sometimes provide multimedia mobile device alternative conventional audio guide see
Tate Modern London
A context aware device use location current user interaction graph connected object dynamically tailor information presented user
In case combined navigation around site guide user artefact exhibit likely interest based user previous interaction

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication

In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

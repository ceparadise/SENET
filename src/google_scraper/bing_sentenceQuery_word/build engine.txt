A automatic designed tabulate
The name derives method way interpolate tabulate function using small set coefficient
Most commonly used engineer scientist navigator including polynomial difference engine compute many useful
The historical difficulty producing table team mathematician spurred desire build mechanism automate process
engineer army conceived idea difference machine
This described book published first written reference basic principle difference machine dated Müller unable obtain funding progress idea
began construct small difference engine completed Difference Engine
He announced invention June paper entitled Note application machinery computation astronomical mathematical table
This machine used decimal number system powered cranking handle
The interested since producing table expensive hoped difference engine would make task economical
In British government gave Babbage start work project
Although Babbage design feasible metalworking technique era could economically make part precision quantity required
Thus implementation proved much expensive doubtful success government initial estimate
In Babbage produced small working model calculating section Difference Engine No
intended operate number difference operated number difference
described seeing working prototype We went see thinking machine seems last Monday
It raised several Nos
power extracted root Quadratic equation
Work larger engine suspended
By time government abandoned project Babbage received spent development still fell short achieving working engine
The government valued machine output economically produced table development unknown unpredictable cost complete machine
Babbage unwilling recognize predicament
Meanwhile Babbage attention moved developing undermining government confidence eventual success difference engine
By improving concept analytical engine Babbage made difference engine concept obsolete project implement utter failure view government
Babbage went design much general later produced improved Difference Engine No
design number difference
Babbage able take advantage idea developed analytical engine make new difference engine calculate quickly using fewer part
Inspired Babbage difference engine built several experimental model
In son Edward proposed construct working model metal finished calculating part capable calculating series number difference later extended
In adding printing part model completed
In funded government construction larger improved number difference machine began finished
The machine demonstrated sold Dudley Observatory Albany New York
In British government ordered next difference machine built
It basic construction previous one
improved Scheutz construction machine capacity Scheutz used device producing publishing printed table interest table table
Alfred Deacon London produced small difference engine number difference
American started working calculating machine unaware work Babbage Scheutz Schentz
One year later learned difference engine proceed design one describing construction
In Boston Thursday Club raised subscription construction model built
It could expanded enhance precision
built one machine number difference Tables Peters Tables eight decimal place first published Leipzig built machine used difference engine
It later replaced Burroughs Class number difference number least difference
built number difference table logarithm Logarithmetica britannica
This machine composed four modified Triumphator calculator
described use calculating machine difference engine number
He also noted National Accounting Machine Class could used difference engine
During associate professor studied Babbage original drawing Difference Analytical Engines library London
This work led Science Museum construct working difference engine No
Curator Computing
This celebrate anniversary Babbage birth
In Babbage originally designed difference engine also completed
The conversion original design drawing drawing suitable engineering manufacturer use revealed minor error Babbage design possibly introduced protection case plan stolen corrected
Once completed engine printer worked flawlessly still
The difference engine printer constructed tolerance achievable technology resolving debate whether Babbage design would actually worked
One reason formerly advanced Babbage engine engineering method insufficiently developed Victorian era
The printer primary purpose produce plate use printing press pressing type soft plaster create
Babbage intended Engine result conveyed directly mass printing recognized many error previous table result human calculating mistake error manual process
The printer paper output mainly mean checking Engine performance
In addition funding construction output mechanism Science Museum Difference Engine No
commissioned construction second complete Difference Engine No
exhibit January
It since transferred display outside main lobby
The difference engine consists number column numbered
The machine able store one decimal number column
The machine add value column column produce new value
Column store column display possibly value calculation current
The engine programmed setting initial value column
Column set value polynomial start computation
Column set value derived first higher polynomial value
Each column set value derived first higher derivative polynomial
In Babbage design one iteration one full set addition operation happens rotation main shaft
Odd even column alternately perform addition one cycle
The sequence operation column thus Steps occur every odd column step occur every even column
While Babbage original design placed crank directly main shaft later realized force required crank machine would great human handle comfortably
Therefore two model built incorporate reduction gear crank four revolution crank required perform one full cycle
Each iteration creates new result accomplished four step corresponding four complete turn handle shown far right picture
The four step The engine represents negative number
Subtraction amount addition negative number
This work manner modern computer perform subtraction known
The principle difference engine
If initial value polynomial calculated mean value difference engine calculate number nearby value using method generally known
For example consider quadratic goal tabulating value forth
The table constructed follows second column contains value polynomial third column contains difference two left neighbor second column fourth column contains difference two neighbor third column The number third constant
In fact starting polynomial degree column number always constant
This crucial fact behind success method
This table built left right possible continue building right left diagonal order compute value
To calculate use value lowest diagonal
Start fourth column constant value copy column
Then continue third column adding get
Next continue second column taking previous value adding third column
Thus
In order compute iterate algorithm value take fourth column add third column value get add second column value get
This process may continued
The value polynomial produced without ever multiply
A difference engine need able add
From one loop next need store example last element first second column
To tabulate polynomial degree one need sufficient storage hold number
Babbage difference engine No
finally built could hold number decimal digit could thus tabulate degree polynomial precision
The best machine Scheutz could store number digit
The initial value column calculated first manually calculating N consecutive value function
calculating required difference
Col get value function start computation
Col difference If function calculated expressed initial value calculated directly constant coefficient without calculating data point
The initial value thus Many commonly used function expressed example
The initial value calculated degree accuracy done correctly engine give exact result first N step
After engine give function
The Taylor series express function sum obtained one point
For many function higher derivative trivial obtain instance function value derivative
Setting start computation get simplified The method calculating initial value coefficient used polynomial function
The polynomial constant coefficient value The problem method described error accumulate series tend diverge true function
A solution guarantee constant maximum error use
A minimum value calculated evenly spaced along range desired calculation
Using curve fitting technique like degree function found
With optimized polynomial initial value calculated

Yet understand programming language one must implement one
Ideally every computer science major would take compiler class
At minimum every computer science major implement interpreter
The following language provide reasonable mixture paradigm practical application Racket dialect Lisp aggressively simple syntax
For small fraction student syntax impediment
To blunt student fundamental mental barrier accepting alien syntactic regime even temporarily lack mental dexterity survive career computer science
Racket powerful macro system facility programming thoroughly erase line data code
If taught correctly Lisp liberates
C terse unforgiving abstraction silicon
C remains without rival programming embedded system
Learning C imparts deep understanding dominant von Neumann architecture way language

Computer scientist understand generative programming macro lexical dynamic scope closure continuation function dynamic dispatch subtyping module functors monad semantic concept distinct specific syntax
Computer scientist must solid grasp formal logic proof
Proof algebraic manipulation natural deduction engages reasoning common routine programming task
Proof induction engages reasoning used construction recursive function
Computer scientist must fluent formal mathematical notation reasoning rigorously basic discrete structure set tuples sequence function power set
For computer scientist important cover reasoning Students learn enough number theory study implement common cryptographic protocol
Students certainly see common rare yet unreasonably effective data structure algorithm
But important knowing specific algorithm data structure usually easy enough look computer scientist must understand design algorithm greedy dynamic strategy span gap algorithm ideal implementation
At minimum computer scientist seeking stable employment know following Computer scientist ready implement extend algorithm operates data structure including ability search element add element remove element
For completeness computer scientist know imperative functional version algorithm
A grasp theory prerequisite research graduate school
Theory invaluable provides hard boundary problem provides mean circumventing initially appear hard boundary
Computational complexity legitimately claim one truly predictive theory computer science
A computer scientist know boundary tractability computability lie
To ignore limit invite frustration best case failure worst
At undergraduate level theory cover least model computation computational complexity
Models computation cover automaton regular language regular expression pushdown automaton language formal grammar Turing machine lambda calculus undecidability
At undergraduate level student learn least enough complexity understand difference P NP
To avoid leaving wrong impression student solve large problem NP reduction SAT use modern SAT solver
There substitute solid understanding computer architecture
Computer scientist understand computer transistor
The understanding architecture encompass standard level abstraction transistor gate adder muxes flip flop ALUs control unit cache RAM
An understanding GPU model computing important foreseeable future
A good understanding cache bus hardware memory management essential achieving good performance modern system
To get good grasp machine architecture student design simulate small CPU
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes operating system
As computer scientist aware kernel handle system call paging scheduling filesystems internal resource management
A good understanding operating system secondary understanding compiler architecture achieving performance
Understanding operating system I would interpret liberally include runtime system becomes especially important programming embedded system without one
It important student get hand dirty real operating system
With Linux virtualization easier ever
To get better understanding kernel student could Given ubiquity network computer scientist firm understanding network stack routing protocol within network
The mechanic building efficient reliable transmission protocol like TCP top unreliable transmission protocol like IP magic computer scientist
It core knowledge
Computer scientist must understand involved protocol design example choose TCP choose UDP
Programmers need understand larger social implication congestion use UDP large scale well
Given frequency modern programmer encounter network programming helpful know protocol existing standard Computer scientist understand exponential back packet collision resolution mechanism involved congestion control
Every computer scientist implement following No student ever pas intro neworking class without sniffing instructor Google query
It probably going far require student implement reliable transmission protocol scratch atop IP I say personally transformative experience student
The sad truth security majority security vulnerability come sloppy programming
The sadder truth many school poor job training programmer secure code
Computer scientist must aware mean program compromised
They need develop sense defensive programming mind thinking code might attacked
Security kind training best distributed throughout entire curriculum discipline warn student native vulnerability
At minimum every computer scientist need understand A reader pointed computer scientist also need aware basic IT security measure choose legitimately good password properly configure firewall iptables
Cryptography make much digital life possible
Computer scientist understand able implement following concept well common pitfall Since common fault implementation cryptosystems every computer scientist know acquire random number task hand
At least nearly every data breach shown computer scientist need know salt hash password storage
Every computer scientist pleasure breaking ciphertext using cryptosystems statistical tool
RSA everyone
Every student create digital certificate set http apache
It surprisingly arduous
Student also write console web client connects SSL
As strictly practical matter computer scientist know use GPG use authentication ssh encrypt directory hard disk
Software testing must distributed throughout entire curriculum
A course software engineering cover basic style testing substitute practicing art
Students graded test case turn
I use test case turned student student
Students seem care much developing defensive test case unleash hell come sandbagging classmate
Programmers often write software programmer worse
User interface design broadly user experience design might underappreciated aspect computer science
There misconception even among professor user experience soft skill ca taught
In reality modern user experience design anchored principle human factor engineering industrial design
If nothing else computer scientist know interface need make ease executing task proportional frequency task multiplied importance
As practicality every programmer comfortable designing usable web interface HTML CSS JavaScript
Good visualization rendering data fashion human perceive information
This easy thing
The modern world sea data exploiting local maximum human perception key making sense
Parallelism back uglier ever
The unfortunate truth harnessing parallelism requires deep knowledge architecture multicore cache bus GPUs etc
And practice
Lots practice
It clear final answer parallel programming solution emerged
For student learn CUDA OpenCL
Threads flimsy abstraction parallelism particularly cache cache coherency involved
But thread popular tricky worth learning
Pthreads reasonably portable thread library learn
For anyone interested parallelism MPI prerequisite
On principle side seem enduring
The principle software engineering change fast programming language
A good course practice team software construction provides working knowledge pitfall inherent endeavor
It recommended several reader student break team three role leader rotating three different project
Learning attack maneuver large existing codebase skill programmer master one best learned school instead job
All student need understand centralized version control system like svn distributed version control system like git
A working knowlege debugging tool like gdb valgrind go long way finally become necessary
As demand secure reliable software increase formal method may one day end mean delivering
At present formal modeling verification software remains challenging progress field steady get easier every year
There may even come day within lifetime computer science major formal software construction expected skill
Every computer scientist least moderately comfortable using one theorem prover
I think matter one
Learning use theorem prover immediately impact coding style
For example one feel instinctively allergic writing statement cover possibility
And writing recursive function user theorem provers strong urge eliminate
There discipline dominated clever graphic
The field driven toward even defined good enough
As better way teach clever programming solid appreciation optimizing effort graphic simulation
Over half coding hack I learned came study graphic
Simple ray tracer constructed line code
It good mental hygiene work transformation necessary perform perspective projection wireframe engine
Data structure like BSP tree algorithm like rendering great example clever design
In graphic simulation many
Robotics may one engaging way teach introductory programming
Moreover cost robotics continues fall threshold passed enable personal robotics revolution
For program unimaginable degree personal physical automation horizon
If reason outsized impact early history computing computer scientist study artificial intelligence
While original dream intelligent machine seems far artificial intelligence spurred number practical field machine learning data mining natural language processing
Aside outstanding technical merit sheer number job opening relevance engineer indicates every computer scientist grasp fundamental machine learning
Machine learning doubly emphasizes need understanding probability statistic
At undergraduate level core concept include Bayesian network clustering learning
Databases common useful ignore
It useful understand fundamental data structure algorithm power database engine since programmer often enough reimplement database system within larger software system
Relational algebra relational calculus stand exceptional success story model computation
Unlike UML modeling ER modeling seems reasonable mechanism visualing encoding design constraint upon software artifact
A computer scientist set operate LAMP stack one good idea lot hard work away running company
My suggestion limited blind spot knowledge
What I listed included

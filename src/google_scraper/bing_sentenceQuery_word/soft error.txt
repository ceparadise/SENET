In type signal datum wrong
Errors may caused usually understood either mistake design construction broken component
A soft error also signal datum wrong assumed imply mistake breakage
After observing soft error implication system le reliable
In spacecraft industry kind error called
In computer memory system soft error change instruction program data value
Soft error typically remedied computer
A soft error damage system hardware damage data processed
There two type soft error
soft error occur particle hit chip radioactive atom chip material decay release alpha particle chip
Because alpha particle contains positive charge kinetic energy particle hit cause cell change state different value
The atomic reaction example tiny damage physical structure chip
soft error occur data processed hit noise phenomenon typically data data bus
The computer try interpret noise data bit cause error addressing processing program code
The bad data bit even saved memory cause problem later time
If detected soft error may corrected rewriting correct data place erroneous data
Highly reliable system use correct soft error fly
However many system may impossible determine correct data even discover error present
In addition correction occur system may case must include
Soft error involve change storage circuit change physical circuit
If data rewritten circuit work perfectly
Soft error occur transmission line digital logic analog circuit magnetic storage elsewhere commonly known semiconductor storage
Whether circuit experience soft error depends energy incoming particle geometry impact location strike design logic circuit
Logic circuit higher higher logic voltage le likely suffer error
This combination capacitance voltage described parameter Q minimum electron charge disturbance needed change logic level
A higher Q mean fewer soft error
Unfortunately higher Q also mean slower logic gate higher power dissipation
Reduction chip feature size supply voltage desirable many reason decrease Q
Thus importance soft error increase chip technology advance
In logic circuit Q defined minimum amount induced charge required circuit node cause voltage pulse propagate node output sufficient duration magnitude reliably latched
Since logic circuit contains many node may struck node may unique capacitance distance output Q typically characterized basis
Soft error became widely known introduction
In early device chip packaging material contained small amount contaminant
Very low decay rate needed avoid excess soft error chip company occasionally suffered problem contamination ever since
It extremely hard maintain material purity needed
Controlling alpha particle emission rate critical packaging material le level count per hour per cm required reliable performance circuit
For comparison count rate typical shoe sole
Package radioactive decay usually cause soft error emission
The positive charged alpha particle travel semiconductor disturbs distribution electron
If disturbance large enough change vice versa
In effect transient perhaps lasting fraction nanosecond led challenge soft error combinational logic mostly going unnoticed
In sequential logic even transient upset become stored indefinite time read later
Thus designer usually much aware problem storage circuit
A paper discus security implication Internet
The paper found incorrect request per day due change various common domain
Many would probably attributable hardware problem could attributed alpha particle
received letter congratulating accidental prediction RAM error novel
Once electronics industry determined control package contaminant became clear cause also work
led program work culminated publication number paper Ziegler Lanford demonstrating also could cause soft error
Indeed modern device cosmic ray may predominant cause
Although primary particle cosmic ray generally reach Earth surface creates energetic secondary particle
At Earth surface approximately particle capable causing soft error energetic neutron remainder composed proton pion
IBM estimated one error per month per ram expected desktop computer
This flux energetic neutron typically referred cosmic ray soft error literature
Neutrons uncharged disturb circuit undergo nucleus atom chip
This process may result production charged secondary alpha particle oxygen nucleus cause soft error
Cosmic ray flux depends altitude
For common reference location N W sea level New York City NY USA flux approximately
Burying system cave reduces rate induced soft error negligible level
In lower level atmosphere flux increase factor every every ft increase altitude sea level
Computers operated top mountain experience order magnitude higher rate soft error compared sea level
The rate upset may time sea level upset rate
This contrast package decay induced soft error change location
As Intel expects error caused cosmic ray increase limiting factor design
The average rate soft error proportional sunspot activity
That average number soft error decrease active portion increase quiet portion
This counterintuitive result occurs two reason
The sun generally produce cosmic ray particle energy GeV capable penetrating Earth upper atmosphere creating particle shower change solar flux directly influence number error
Further increase solar flux active sun period effect reshaping Earth magnetic field providing additional shielding higher energy cosmic ray resulting decrease number particle creating shower
The effect fairly small case resulting modulation energetic neutron flux New York City
Other location similarly affected
Energetic neutron produced cosmic ray may lose kinetic energy reach thermal equilibrium surroundings scattered material
The resulting neutron simply referred average kinetic energy
Thermal neutron also produced environmental radiation source decay naturally occurring uranium thorium
The thermal neutron flux source shower may still noticeable underground location important contributor soft error circuit
Neutrons lost kinetic energy thermal equilibrium surroundings important cause soft error circuit
At low energy many reaction become much probable result fission certain material creating charged secondary fission byproduct
For circuit capture nucleus B particularly important
This nuclear reaction efficient producer nucleus
Either charged particle alpha Li may cause soft error produced close proximity approximately critical circuit node
The capture cross section B smaller contribute soft error
used insulator interconnection layer integrated circuit particularly lowest one
The inclusion boron lower melt temperature glass providing better planarization characteristic
In application glass formulated boron content weight
Naturally occurring boron B remainder B isotope
Soft error caused high level B critical lower layer older integrated circuit process
used low concentration dopant contribute soft error
Integrated circuit manufacturer eliminated borated dielectric time individual circuit component decreased size nm largely due problem
In critical design depleted almost entirely used avoid effect therefore reduce soft error rate

For application medical electronic device soft error mechanism may extremely important
Neutrons produced high energy cancer radiation therapy using photon beam energy MeV
These neutron moderated scattered equipment wall treatment room resulting thermal neutron flux higher normal environmental neutron flux
This high thermal neutron flux generally result high rate soft error consequent circuit upset
Soft error also caused problem inductive capacitive
However general source represent small contribution overall soft error rate compared radiation effect
One experiment measured soft error rate sea level FIT failure per billion hour per DRAM chip
When test setup moved underground vault shielded foot rock effectively eliminated cosmic ray zero soft error recorded
In test cause soft error small measured compared error rate caused cosmic ray
Some test conclude isolation memory cell circumvented unintended side effect specially crafted access adjacent cell
Thus accessing data stored DRAM cause Memory cell leak charge interact electrically result high cell density modern memory altering content nearby memory row actually addressed original memory access
This effect known also used computer security
A designer attempt minimize rate soft error judicious device design choosing right semiconductor package substrate material right device geometry
Often however limited need reduce device size voltage increase operating speed reduce power dissipation
The susceptibility device upset described industry using standard
One technique used reduce soft error rate digital circuit called
This involves increasing capacitance selected circuit node order increase effective Q value
This reduces range particle energy logic value node upset
Radiation hardening often accomplished increasing size transistor share region node
Since area power overhead radiation hardening restrictive design technique often applied selectively node predicted highest probability resulting soft error struck
Tools model predict node vulnerable subject past current research area soft error
There work addressing soft error processor memory resource using hardware software technique
Several research effort addressed soft error proposing error detection recovery via redundant
These approach used special hardware replicate application execution identify error output increased hardware design complexity cost including high performance overhead
soft error tolerant scheme hand flexible applied commercial microprocessor
Many work propose instruction replication result checking soft error detection
Designers choose accept soft error occur design system appropriate error detection correction recover gracefully
Typically semiconductor memory design might use incorporating redundant data create
Alternatively used detecting soft error rewriting correct data another source
This technique often used
Soft error sometimes detected corrected using technique design
These often include use redundant circuitry computation data typically come cost circuit area decreased performance higher power consumption
The concept TMR employed ensure high reliability logic circuit
In technique three identical copy circuit compute data parallel output fed returning value occurred least two three case
In way failure one circuit due soft error discarded assuming two circuit operated correctly
In practice however designer afford greater circuit area power overhead required usually selectively applied
Another common concept correct soft error logic circuit temporal time redundancy one circuit operates data multiple time compare subsequent evaluation consistency
This approach however often incurs performance overhead area overhead copy latch used store data power overhead though considerably modular redundancy
Traditionally attention quest reduce soft error due fact DRAM comprised susceptible device surface area desktop server computer system ref
prevalence ECC RAM server computer
Hard figure DRAM susceptibility hard come vary considerably across design fabrication process manufacturer
technology kilobit DRAMS could cluster five six bit flip single
Modern DRAMs much smaller feature size deposition similar amount charge could easily cause many bit flip
The design error detection correction circuit helped fact soft error usually localised small area chip
Usually one cell memory affected although high energy event cause upset
Conventional memory layout usually place one bit many different correction word adjacent chip
So even lead number separate multiple correction word rather single correction word
So error correcting code need cope single bit error correction word order cope likely soft error
The term used upset affecting multiple cell memory whatever correction word cell happen fall
used multiple bit single correction word error
The three natural masking effect determine whether SEU propagate become soft error
An SEU propagation blocked reaching output latch gate input prevent logical transition gate output
An SEU signal attenuated electrical property gate propagation path resulting pulse insufficient magnitude reliably latched
An SEU erroneous pulse reach output latch occur close enough latch actually triggered hold
If three masking effect fail occur propagated pulse becomes latched output logic circuit erroneous value
In context circuit operation erroneous output value may considered soft error event
However standpoint affected result may change output program
For instance erroneous data could overwritten use masked subsequent logic operation simply never used
If erroneous data affect output program considered example
Soft error rate SER rate device system encounter predicted encounter soft error
It typically expressed either number FIT MTBF
The unit adopted quantifying failure time called FIT equivalent one error per billion hour device operation
MTBF usually given year device operation put perspective one FIT equal approximately time MTBF
While many electronic system MTBF exceeds expected lifetime circuit SER may still unacceptable manufacturer customer
For instance many failure per million circuit due soft error expected field system adequate soft error protection
The failure even product field particularly catastrophic tarnish reputation product company designed
Also application cost system failure far outweighs cost system chance soft error failure per lifetime may high acceptable customer
Therefore advantageous design low SER manufacturing system requiring extremely high reliability

According Science pursuit application knowledge understanding natural social world following systematic methodology based evidence
The Council go describe Scientific Method In case systematic observation using scientific method relatively straightforward process easily replicated others
In case objective observation replication difficult impossible
In general science easily make use scientific method described termed hard science observation difficult termed soft science
Sciences explore working natural world usually called hard science
These also called natural science
They include Hard science like involve experiment relatively easy set make objective measurement
Results hard science experiment represented mathematically mathematical tool used consistently measure calculate outcome
For example X quantity Y mineral tested Z chemical mathematically describable outcome
The quantity mineral tested chemical precisely result
There variation outcome unless material used conduct experiment changed example mineral sample chemical impure
In general soft science deal intangible relate study human animal behavior interaction thought feeling
Soft science apply scientific method intangible nature living being almost impossible recreate soft science experiment exactitude
Some example soft science sometimes referred social science include Particularly science dealing people may difficult isolate variable may influence outcome
In case controlling variable may even alter result
Simply put harder devise experiment soft science
For example A researcher hypothesizes girl likely boy experience bullying
They select cohort girl boy particular class particular school follow experience
In fact find boy likely bullied
The experiment repeated using number child methodology different school
The opposite outcome occurs
The reason difference extremely difficult determine could relate teacher individual student socioeconomics school surrounding community etc
The term hard science soft science used le often used part terminology misunderstood therefore offensive
People perceive harder imply difficult may much challenging devise interpret experiment soft science hard science
The distinction two type science matter strongly state test accept reject hypothesis
In modern world degree difficulty le related discipline specific question one might say term hard science soft science outdated

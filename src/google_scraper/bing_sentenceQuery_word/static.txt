There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine
Perhaps need scroll right bit

I heard many term like Dynamic binding Static binding Dynamic linking Static linking Dynamic loading
All I know term vocabulary dynamic mean runtime
But Dynamic Static
According dictionary dynamic something keep changing Happen runtime equal Something keep changing
I see point people using dynamic mean Happen runtime
Dynamic linking program dynamically linked number shared library modify library main program provided change interface
So yes library might keep changing
An example upgrade Linux typically get new version many system library
Dynamic binding work programming language support dynamic binding function call bound function body dynamically based argument function called upon

A OOP associated
An object mostly made data behavior form interface object present outside world
Data represented object behavior method
For example object would method state whether opened closed would property
In method defined object instance given class
One important capability method provides method overriding
The name used multiple different kind class
This allows sending object invoke behavior delegate implementation behavior receiving object
A method Java programming set behavior class object
For example object send message another object appropriate formula invoked whether receiving object etc
Methods also provide interface class use access modify data object
This known encapsulation
Encapsulation overriding two primary distinguishing feature method procedure call
overloading two significant way method differs conventional procedure function call
Overriding refers subclass redefining implementation method superclass
For example may method defined shape class
The various subclass etc
would define appropriate formula calculate area
The idea look object black box change internals object made minimal impact object use
This known encapsulation meant make code easier maintain
Method overloading hand refers differentiating code used handle message based parameter method
If one view receiving object first parameter method overriding special case overloading selection based first argument
The following simple example illustrates difference Accessor method used read data value object
Mutator method used modify data object
Manager method used initialize destroy object class
constructor destructors
These method provide facilitates
For example class provides accessor method retrieve current rather directly accessing balance data field later code implement complex mechanism balance retrieval fetch without dependent code needing changed
The concept encapsulation modularity unique programming
Indeed many way approach simply logical extension previous paradigm
A method called beginning object lifetime create initialize object process called
Initialization may include acquisition resource
Constructors may parameter usually return value language
See following example Java A method called automatically end object lifetime process called
Destruction language allow destructor method argument return value
Destruction implemented perform cleanup chore task object destruction
In language destructors known
They similar purpose function destructors difference language utilize language manual memory management sequence called different
An one
It often used specify subclass must provide implementation method
Abstract method used specify computer language
The following code show abstract class need extended The following subclass extends main class Class method method called rather instance
They typically used part object
class defined instance class object created
allow class created deleted
In sense provide functionality constructor destructors described
But language allows developer dynamically alter object model run time create new class redefine class hierarchy modify property etc
Special method language may support none special method defined
A language compiler may automatically generate default special method programmer may allowed optionally define special method
Most special method directly called rather compiler generates code call appropriate time
Static method meant relevant instance class rather specific instance
They similar static variable sense
An example would static method sum value variable every instance class
For example class might static method compute average price product
In Java commonly used static method This static method owning object run instance
It receives information argument
A static method invoked even instance class exist yet
Static method called static resolved compile time based class called dynamically case instance method resolved polymorphically based runtime type object
operator define action performed compiler class object assigned class object type
Operator method define operation performed symbol associated method parameter
Example Some procedural language extended capability leverage large skill set legacy code language still provide benefit development
Perhaps example extension programming language
Due design requirement add paradigm existing procedural language message passing unique capability terminology
For example method known
also concept member function allow
mean class achieve polymorphic behavior
participate

When internal working computer exposed possible damage computer static electricity held human body
Whenever casing computer opened internal working exposed change add memory chip example danger damaging computer buildup held human body
The internal working computer especially hard drive extremely susceptible static electricity cause considerable damage hard drive zapped even small amount
damage occur exposed static electricity low volt human able perceive static electricity reached volt
Walking across rug produce static electricity voltage volt static voltage life threatening
So possible damage hard drive static electricity even felt person low voltage
Also computer become increasingly susceptible static electricity damage circuitry built
Static electricity caused process called
Everything around u including u made atom every atom center nucleus positively charged proton neutron electrical charge
Surrounding atom negatively charged electron
The proton neutron atom change electron move one atom another
When two object touch exchange electron cause one object become electrically positive become electrically negative
When object touch another object either opposite neutral charge electron flow
Static electricity created electron move back forth atom
To avoid zapping component static electricity take precaution ground static electricity touching internal component computer
Wearing working mat prevent static electricity damaging computer
Another way ground static electricity touch internal metal frame computer case computer plugged electrical socket
The static electricity discharged grounded electrical circuit grounded via AC outlet
Also work PCs often consider using humidifier help control static electricity room work need stand carpet rug
Always handle electronic circuitry hard drive internal component insulated area insure send bolt static electricity coursing
An important exception rule working inside monitor
You ground working inside monitor
Monitors store electricity capacitor grounding provide conduit voltage discharge body
An older store enough electricity capacitor lethal released often ten thousand volt
Even power monitor disconnected power source monitor retains extremely high electrical charge

Static electricity nuisance even danger
The energy make hair stand end also damage electronics cause explosion
However properly controlled manipulated also tremendous boon modern life
Electric charge fundamental property matter according Michael Richmond physic professor
Nearly electric charge universe carried proton electron
Protons said charge electron unit electron charge although sign completely arbitrary
Because proton generally confined atomic nucleus turn imbedded inside atom nearly free move electron
Therefore talk nearly always mean flow electron talk static electricity generally mean object
One common cause static charge buildup contact solid material
According When two object rubbed together create static electricity one object give electron becomes positively charged material collect electron becomes negatively This one material weakly bound electron many vacancy outer electron shell electron move former latter creating charge imbalance material separated
Materials lose gain electron way called triboelectric according
One common example would shuffling foot across carpet particularly low humidity make air le conductive increase effect
Because like charge repel tend migrate extremity charged object order get away
This cause hair stand end body take static charge according Library Congress
When touch grounded piece metal screw light switch plate provides path ground charge built body
This sudden discharge creates visible audible spark air finger screw
This due high potential difference body ground much volt
In addition causing painful shock sudden discharge provide source ignition flammable substance according
Static shock also damage delicate electronics
According simple spark finger damage sensitive component render unusable precaution must taken keeping circuit board conductive plastic bag wearing grounding strap dissipate static charge continuously body
Another source static charge motion fluid pipe hose
If fluid flammable gasoline spark sudden discharge could result fire explosion
People handle liquid fuel take great care avoid charge buildup sudden discharge
In interview Daniel Marsh professor physic Missouri Southern State University warned putting gasoline car always touch metal part car getting dissipate charge might developed sliding across seat
Also buying gas lawn mower always take car place ground filling
This dissipates static charge continuously keep building enough create spark
Large tank farm present even greater danger fire explosion National Transportation Safety Board NTSB issued guideline include minimizing static generation preventing charge accumulation avoiding spark discharge controlling environment inside tank
Moving gas vapor also generate static charge
The familiar case lightning
According Martin Uman author Dover Benjamin Franklin proved lightning form static electricity son flew kite thunderstorm
They attached key kite string wet string conducted charge cloud key gave spark touched
Contrary version legend kite struck lightning
If result could disastrous
fact shaped way think electricity
He became interested studying electricity
Until people thought electrical effect result mixing two different electrical fluid
However Franklin became convinced one single electric fluid object could excess deficiency fluid
He invented term positive negative referring excess deficiency according
Today know fluid actually electron discovered year
According cloud develop zone static charge due warm water droplet updraft exchanging electron cold ice crystal downdraft
According potential atmospheric charge ground exceed volt consequence struck lightning deadly
In lightning strike current tends move surface body process called external flashover cause severe burn particularly initial point contact
Some current though travel body damage nervous system according
Additionally concussion blast cause traumatic internal injury permanent hearing loss bright flash cause temporary permanent vision damage
As example tremendous energy released lightning strike Marsh told Live Science personal observation large oak tree literally split half steam created lightning strike
If hear thunder generally already within striking range according
If outdoors storm approach immediately seek shelter building vehicle avoid touching metal
If get inside move away tall object tree tower hilltop squat possible balance ball foot making little contact ground possible according Brigham Young University
While static electricity nuisance even danger case static cling static shock case quite useful
For instance static charge induced electrical current
One example named capacity store electric charge analogous spring store mechanical energy
A voltage applied capacitor creates charge difference plate
If capacitor charged voltage switched retain charge time
This useful case replace rechargeable battery application also dangerous
Electronic equipment older CRT computer monitor television set contain large capacitor retain charge volt cause injury death even device turned several day
Another way create useful static charge mechanical strain
In electron literally squeezed place forced move region strain
The voltage due resulting charge imbalance harnessed work
One application energy harvesting whereby device operate energy produced environmental vibration
Another application
Sound wave air deflect diaphragm connected piezoelectric member convert sound wave electrical signal
In inverse operation electric signal cause piezoelectric transducer loudspeaker move thus reproducing sound
Localized static charge also affected intense light
This principle behind
In photocopier light may come projected image sheet paper laser printer image traced onto drum scanning laser beam
The entire drum initially charged coronal discharge wire give free electron air exploiting principle cause
The electron wire attracted positively charged drum
An image projected onto photoconductive drum charge dissipated illuminated area dark area image remain charged
The charged area drum attract oppositely charged toner particle rolled onto paper backed positively charged roller fused place electric heating element
Marsh noted power plant use collect particulate smokestack disposed solid waste rather discharged air
In another application described static charge applied herbicide sprayed onto weed fine mist
The charged droplet attracted distributed evenly leaf undesirable plant rather falling onto ground wasted
The principle used paint go onto target le air wall floor paint room

trying make interface class ticket machine
well real coursework computer science module
dont understand use static method
dont know much computer science main method seem use static
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Think class cookie cutter object cookie instance class
Static method method part class cookie cutter whereas method part class instance cooky
In case static method would thing specific ticket machine general like calculating much money deducted
method would thing specific single ticket counter keeping track many ticket processed
Here information A method associated instance class
Any method use modify instance class defined
Short answer That making use object
You instantiate class object run using using method
Instance method machine static method something affect ticket machine simultaneously
Now case may realistically use e time
But conceptually machine would keyboard screen CPU method instance
That mean need create machine Of course currently writing directly standard sure read
A better design might pas UNInterfaceTest constructor write instead
That let machine screen
Of course information may beyond scope assignment
It still useful know

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

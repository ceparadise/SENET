In mathematically based technique whose purpose help implementation system software
They used describe system analyze behavior aid design verifying key property interest rigorous effective reasoning tool
These specification sense syntax semantics fall within one domain able used infer useful information
In passing decade computer system become increasingly powerful result become impactful society
Because better technique needed assist design implementation reliable software
Established engineering discipline use mathematical analysis foundation creating validating product design
Formal specification one way achieve software engineering reliability predicted
Other method commonly used enhance code quality
Given possible use technique demonstrate system design correct respect specification
This allows incorrect system design revised major investment made actual implementation
Another approach use probably correct step transform specification design ultimately transformed implementation
It important note formal specification implementation rather may used develop
Formal specification describe system system
A good specification must following attribute adequate internally consistent unambiguous complete satisfied minimal A good specification One main reason interest formal specification provide ability perform proof software implementation
These proof may used validate specification verify correctness design prove program satisfies specification
A design implementation ever declared correct
It ever correct respect given specification
Whether formal specification correctly describes problem solved separate issue
It also difficult issue address since ultimately concern problem constructing abstracted formal representation informal concrete abstraction step amenable formal proof
However possible specification proving challenge concerning property specification expected exhibit
If correct theorem reinforce specifier understanding specification relationship underlying problem domain
If specification probably need changed better reflect domain understanding involved producing implementing specification
Formal method software development widely used industry
Most company consider apply software development process
This may variety reason Other limitation Formal specification technique existed various domain various scale quite time
Implementations formal specification differ depending kind system attempting model applied point software life cycle introduced
These type model categorized following specification paradigm In addition paradigm way apply certain heuristic help improve creation specification
The paper referenced best discus heuristic use designing specification
They applying approach
The example leading formal
Others include Specification Language AMN

closely related concept interoperability meaning ability user one member group disparate system functionality work system group equal ease via interface
In case database

characteristic product system whose interface completely understood work product system present future either implementation access without restriction
While term initially defined service allow information exchange broader definition take account social political organizational factor impact system system performance
Task building coherent service user individual component technically different managed different organization If two system capable communicating exhibit syntactic interoperability using specified
standard among tool syntactic interoperability
This also true data format ensuring alphabetical character stored format English international text communicating system
Beyond ability two computer system exchange information semantic interoperability ability automatically interpret information exchanged meaningfully accurately order produce useful result defined end user system
To achieve semantic interoperability side must refer common information exchange reference model
The content information exchange request unambiguously defined sent understood
The possibility promoting result convergence disparate interpretation information object study research prototype
Multiple social organizational political legal entity working together common interest information exchange
Interoperability imply Open standard
definition
Interoperability imply exchange range product similar product several different vendor even past future revision product
Interoperability may developed special measure two product excluding rest using Open standard
When vendor forced adapt system dominant system based Open standard interoperability
Open standard rely broadly consultative inclusive group including representative vendor academic others holding stake development discus debate technical economic merit demerit feasibility proposed common protocol
After doubt reservation member addressed resulting common document endorsed This document subsequently released public henceforth becomes It usually published available freely nominal cost comer Various vendor individual even part original group use standard document make product implement common protocol defined standard thus specific liability advantage customer choosing one product another basis standardised feature
The vendor product compete quality implementation user interface ease use performance price host factor keeping customer data intact transferable even chooses switch another competing product business reason
interoperability may result absolute market dominance particular product contravention applicable standard effective standard present time product introduction
The vendor behind product choose forthcoming standard standardisation process using insist product set standard market dominance
This problem product implementation open minimally encumbered may well closed heavily encumbered
patent claim
Because achieving interoperability product critical vendor wish remain relevant market difficult accomplish lack equal term original vendor may well see new vendor potential competitor threat
The newer implementation often rely absence technical data achieve interoperability
The original vendor provide technical data others often name competition data invariably encumbered may limited use
Availability data equivalent open standard In term defined In interoperability composed three dimension Search interoperability refers ability two information collection searched single query
Specifically related search challenge interoperability stem fact designer web resource typically little need concern exchanging information web resource
technology place format requirement data owner emerged one solution search interoperability challenge
In addition standard emerged recently also help address issue search interoperability related web resource
Such standard also address broader topic interoperability allowing data mining
With respect term used describe capability different program exchange data via common set exchange format read write use
The ability execute different platform contemplated definition interoperability
The lack interoperability consequence lack attention design program
Indeed interoperability taken granted portion computing world
According interoperability defined follows The capability communicate execute program transfer data among various functional unit manner requires user little knowledge unique characteristic unit
Note definition somewhat ambiguous program another program latter portion set program required interoperable might well need knowledge characteristic unit
This definition focus technical side interoperability also pointed interoperability often organizational issue often interoperability significant impact organization concerned raising issue ownership people want share data
dealing labor relation people prepared undergo training
usability
In context apt definition captured term
Interoperability important consequence example research estimated cost inadequate interoperability capital facility industry billion year
If competitor product interoperable due cause result may well
For reason may prudent user community government take step encourage interoperability various situation
At least international body country implemented interoperability framework initiative called United States initiative
Standards Defining Organizations SDOs provide open public software specification facilitate interoperability example include organization formerly International Alliance Interoperability
As far user community creating standard business process interoperability
Another example neutral party document IETF
The OSLC Open Service Lifecycle Collaboration community working finding common standard order software tool share exchange data
bug task requirement etc
The final goal agree open standard interoperability open source tool
Java great example interoperable programming language allows program written run anywhere Java Virtual Machine
One writing program Java long use system specific functionality maintain interoperability machine Java Virtual Machine
There many implementation Java Virtual Machine Oracle IBM Android etc
If Java Virtual Machine created specification application maintain compatibility implementation different underlying language interface
Many organization dedicated interoperability
All common want push development World Wide Web towards semantic web
Some concentrate eGovernment eBusiness data exchange general
Internationally facilitates global interoperability across border language technical barrier
In Europe instance European Commission programme issue
IDABC succeeded programme
They also initiated
A EULIS established consortium European National Land Registers
The aim service establish single portal customer provided access information individual property land property registration service associated legal environment
In United States government service provides collaboration environment component development sharing registration reuse related work component repository
The serf agency measurement standard
New technology introduced lab rate
The need interoperability ability take medical device box easily make work one device attracted great attention healthcare provider industry
Increasingly medical device like incubator imaging MRI CT ultrasound others driven sophisticated software must integrate point care electronic system electronic medical record
At Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society RAPS meeting expert field like Angela Johnson GE Healthcare representative United States Food Drug Administration provided practical seminar company developing new medical device hospital installing work effectively align interoperable software system
The HIMSS board approved following definition interoperability April In healthcare interoperability ability different information technology system software application communicate exchange data use information exchanged
Data exchange schema standard permit data shared across clinician lab hospital pharmacy patient regardless application application vendor
Interoperability mean ability health information system work together within across organizational boundary order advance effective delivery healthcare individual community
There three level health information technology interoperability Foundational Structural Semantic
They also introduced ConCert comprehensive interoperability testing IOT certification program
One first product completed testing program iPatientCare EHR system
Speaking perspective interoperability refers collaboration ability service citizen business public administration
Exchanging data challenge due language barrier different specification format variety categorisation
Many hindrance identified
If data interpreted differently collaboration limited take longer efficient
For instance citizen country A want purchase land country B person asked submit proper address data
Address data country include Full name detail street name number well post code
The order address detail might vary
In language obstacle order provided address data across language barrier becomes difficult
If language requires character almost impossible translation tool available
Hence eGovernment application need exchange data semantically interoperable manner
This save time money reduces source error
Fields practical use found every policy area justice trade participation etc
Clear concept interpretation pattern required
Interoperability important issue public health safety department first responder need able communicate emergency
It major area investment research last year
Traditionally agency could exchange information operated widely disparate hardware incompatible
Agencies information system dispatch system CAD record management system RMS functioned largely isolation information island
Agencies tried bridge isolation inefficient method large agency began implementing limited interoperable system
These approach inadequate lack interoperability public safety realm become evident Pentagon World Trade Center structure
Further evidence lack interoperability surfaced agency tackled aftermath Hurricane Katrina disaster
In contrast overall national picture state including Utah already made great stride forward
The department Utah created statewide network using technology company based
The Commonwealth Virginia one leading state United States improving interoperability continually recognized National Best Practice Department Homeland Security DHS
Virginia proven governance structure ensures right player involved decision making training exercise planning effort
The Interoperability Coordinator leverage regional structure better allocate grant funding around Commonwealth area opportunity improve communication interoperability
Virginia strategic plan communication updated yearly include new initiative Commonwealth project effort tied plan aligned National Emergency Communications Plan authored Department Homeland Security Office Emergency Communications OEC
The State Washington seek enhance interoperability statewide
The State Interoperability Executive Committee SIEC established legislature work assist emergency responder agency police fire sheriff medical hazmat etc
level government city county state tribal federal define interoperability local region
Washington recognizes collaborating system design development wireless radio system enables emergency responder agency efficiently provide additional service increase interoperability reduce cost
This work save life emergency personnel citizen serve
The government making effort overcome nation lack public safety interoperability
The Department Homeland Security OIC pursuing SAFECOM program designed help agency integrate CAD IT system
The OIC launched CADIP August
This project partner OIC agency several location including
This program use case study identify best practice challenge associated linking CAD system across jurisdictional boundary
These lesson create tool resource public safety agency use build interoperable CAD system communicate across local state federal boundary

Software interoperability achieved five interrelated way Each important role reducing variability intercommunication software enhancing common understanding end goal achieved
Interoperability tends regarded issue expert implication daily living sometimes underrated
The show interoperability concern important question power relationship
In European Commission found Microsoft abused market power deliberately restricting interoperability Windows work group server work group server
By Microsoft able protect dominant market position work group server operating system heart corporate IT network
Microsoft ordered disclose complete accurate interface documentation enable rival vendor compete equal footing interoperability remedy
As June Commission market testing new proposal Microsoft rejected previous proposal insufficient
Interoperability also surfaced

Want watch later
Have ever asked government agency coordinate midst national disaster
In event national disaster event requires federal state local coordination needed order public safety remain priority
Interoperability ability system work together order communicate exchange information necessary
Interoperability come play natural disaster manmade disaster national emergency major car aviation navigable water accident emergency
Interoperability pertains coordination various integral system voice data video system
The essential system interoperability communication system
This relates radio system permit various entity communicate necessary
Common language designated line authority line issue relate interoperability emergency
Operators must understand utilize designated radio system well
Get FREE access day create account
In addition designated computer system must compatible utilize common language
Also mobile device smart phone tablet device host application require coordination resolution privacy concern data security issue
All issue relate interoperability
The management monitoring interoperability standard become challenge emergency
Therefore interoperability issue must resolved prior time interoperability necessary
Governmental office emergency management specific team devoted interoperability effectiveness
On federal level interoperability function Federal Emergency Management Administration also known
State local government similar office handle interoperability
Sometimes office referred Management
Furthermore police public safety emergency response official involved interoperability
These entity designated first responder emergency situation therefore interoperability critical group
In addition agreement government help coordinate effort set standard interoperability achieved necessary

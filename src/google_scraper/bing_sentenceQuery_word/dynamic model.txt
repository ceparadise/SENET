Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

A description using concept
The process developing mathematical model termed
Mathematical model used discipline well
analyst use mathematical model extensively
A model may help explain system study effect different component make prediction behaviour
Mathematical model take many form including
These type model overlap given model involving variety abstract structure
In general mathematical model may include
In many case quality scientific field depends well mathematical model developed theoretical side agree result repeatable experiment
Lack agreement theoretical mathematical model experimental measurement often lead important advance better theory developed
In traditional mathematical model contains four major element
These Mathematical model usually composed relationship
Relationships described algebraic operator function differential operator etc
Variables abstraction system interest
Several classification criterion used mathematical model according structure Mathematical model great importance natural science particularly
Physical almost invariably expressed using mathematical model
Throughout history accurate mathematical model developed
accurately describe many everyday phenomenon certain limit must used even apply situation need refinement
It possible obtain le accurate model appropriate limit example relativistic mechanic reduces Newtonian mechanic speed much le
Quantum mechanic reduces classical physic quantum number high
For example tennis ball insignificantly small classical physic good approximation use case
It common use idealized model physic simplify thing
Massless rope point particle among many simplified model used physic
The law physic represented simple equation Newton law
These law basis making mathematical model real situation
Many real situation complex thus modeled approximate computer model computationally feasible compute made basic law approximate model made basic law
For example molecule modeled model approximate solution Schrödinger equation
In physic model often made mathematical method
Different mathematical model use different geometry necessarily accurate description geometry universe
much used classical physic example theory use Euclidean
Since simple model used
Often engineer analyze system controlled optimized use mathematical model
In analysis engineer build descriptive model system hypothesis system could work try estimate unforeseeable event could affect system
Similarly control system engineer try different control approach
A mathematical model usually describes system variable set equation establish relationship variable
Variables may many type number value example
The variable represent property system example measured system output often form counter event occurrence
The actual model set function describe relation different variable
In mathematical model may used maximize certain output
The system consideration require certain input
The system relating input output depends variable variable
Decision variable sometimes known independent variable
Exogenous variable sometimes known
The variable independent state variable dependent decision input random exogenous variable
Furthermore output variable dependent state system represented state variable
system user represented output variable state variable
The depend perspective model user
Depending context objective function also known measure interest user
Although limit number objective function constraint model using optimizing model becomes involved computationally number increase
For example often apply using
Complicated mathematical model many variable may consolidated use one symbol represents several variable
Mathematical modeling problem often classified model according much information system available
A model system priori information available
A model also called glass box clear box system necessary information available
Practically system somewhere model concept useful intuitive guide deciding approach take
Usually preferable use much priori information possible make model accurate
Therefore model usually considered easier used information correctly model behave correctly
Often priori information come form knowing type function relating different variable
For example make model medicine work human system know usually amount medicine blood function
But still left several unknown parameter rapidly medicine amount decay initial amount medicine blood
This example therefore completely model
These parameter estimated mean one use model
In model one try estimate functional form relation variable numerical parameter function
Using priori information could end example set function probably could describe system adequately
If priori information would try use function general possible cover different model
An often used approach model usually make assumption incoming data
Alternatively NARMAX Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model eXogenous input algorithm developed part used select model term determine model structure estimate unknown parameter presence correlated nonlinear noise
The advantage NARMAX model compared neural network NARMAX produce model written related underlying process whereas neural network produce approximation opaque
Sometimes useful incorporate subjective information mathematical model
This done based based convenience mathematical form
provides theoretical framework incorporating subjectivity rigorous analysis specify subjective update distribution based empirical data
An example approach would necessary situation experimenter bend coin slightly toss recording whether come head given task predicting probability next flip come head
After bending coin true probability coin come head unknown experimenter would need make decision perhaps looking shape coin prior distribution use
Incorporation subjective information might important get accurate estimate probability
In general model complexity involves simplicity accuracy model
principle particularly relevant modeling essential idea among model roughly equal predictive power simplest one desirable
While added complexity usually improves realism model make model difficult understand analyze also pose computational problem including
argues science progress explanation tend become complex offer radical simplification
For example modeling flight aircraft could embed mechanical part aircraft model would thus acquire almost model system
However computational cost adding huge amount detail would effectively inhibit usage model
Additionally uncertainty would increase due overly complex system separate part induces amount variance model
It therefore usually appropriate make approximation reduce model sensible size
Engineers often accept approximation order get robust simple model
For example approximated model real world
Still Newton model quite sufficient situation long particle speed well study
Any model pure contains used fit model system intended describe
If modeling done optimization parameter called optimization model hyperparameters called often us
In conventional modeling explicitly given mathematical function parameter often determined
A crucial part modeling process evaluation whether given mathematical model describes system accurately
This question difficult answer involves several different type evaluation
Usually easiest part model evaluation checking whether model fit experimental measurement empirical data
In model parameter common approach test fit split data two disjoint subset training data verification data
The training data used estimate model parameter
An accurate model closely match verification data even though data used set model parameter
This practice referred statistic
Defining measure distance observed predicted data useful tool assessing model fit
In statistic decision theory play similar role
While rather straightforward test appropriateness parameter difficult test validity general mathematical form model
In general mathematical tool developed test fit model involving
Tools sometimes used evaluate well data fit known distribution come general model make minimal assumption model mathematical form
Assessing scope model determining situation model applicable le straightforward
If model constructed based set data one must determine system situation known data typical set data
The question whether model describes well property system data point called question event data point outside observed data called
As example typical limitation scope model evaluating Newtonian note Newton made measurement without advanced equipment could measure property particle travelling speed close speed light
Likewise measure movement molecule small particle macro particle
It surprising model extrapolate well domain even though model quite sufficient ordinary life physic
Many type modeling implicitly involve claim
This usually always true model involving differential equation
As purpose modeling increase understanding world validity model rest fit empirical observation also ability extrapolate situation data beyond originally described model
One think differentiation qualitative quantitative prediction
One also argue model worthless unless provides insight go beyond already known direct investigation phenomenon studied
An example criticism argument mathematical model offer insight go beyond conclusion basic principle ecology
Σ δ The state represents even number input far signifies odd number
A input change state automaton
When input end state show whether input contained even number
If input contain even number finish state accepting state input string accepted
The language recognized given denotes number possibly zero symbol

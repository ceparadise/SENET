Interrupt handler initiated hardware interrupt software interrupt instruction software used implementing transition protected mode operation
The traditional form interrupt handler hardware interrupt handler
Hardware interrupt arise electrical condition protocol implemented usually dispatched via table interrupt vector asynchronously normal execution stream interrupt masking level permit often using separate stack automatically entering different execution context privilege level duration interrupt handler execution
In general hardware interrupt handler used handle condition require interruption current code executing
Later found convenient software able trigger mechanism mean software interrupt form synchronous interrupt
Rather using interrupt dispatch table hardware level software interrupt often implemented level form
Interrupt handler multitude function vary based triggered interrupt speed interrupt handler completes task
For example pressing key moving trigger interrupt call interrupt handler read key mouse position copy associated information computer memory
An interrupt handler counterpart
However interrupt handler unusual execution context many harsh constraint time space intrinsically asynchronous nature make notoriously difficult debug standard practice reproducible test case generally exist thus demanding specialized important subset software engineer engage hardware interrupt layer
Unlike event handler interrupt handler expected set interrupt flag appropriate value part core functionality
Even CPU support nested interrupt handler often reached interrupt globally masked CPU hardware operation
In architecture interrupt handler would normally save smallest amount context necessary reset global interrupt disable flag first opportunity permit higher priority interrupt interrupt current handler
It also important interrupt handler quell current interrupt source method often toggling flag bit kind peripheral register current interrupt immediately repeated handler exit resulting infinite loop
Exiting interrupt handler interrupt system exactly right state every eventuality sometimes arduous exacting task mishandling source many serious bug kind halt system completely
These bug sometimes intermittent mishandled edge case occurring week month continuous operation
Formal validation interrupt handler tremendously difficult testing typically identifies frequent failure mode thus subtle intermittent bug interrupt handler often ship end customer
In modern operating system upon entry execution context hardware interrupt handler subtle
For reason performance handler typically initiated memory execution context running process special connection interrupt essentially usurping running time accounting often accrue time spent handling interrupt interrupted process
However unlike interrupted process interrupt usually elevated CPU mechanism privilege level high enough access hardware resource directly
In microcontroller chip might lack protection mode MMU
In chip execution context interrupt handler essentially interrupted program typically run small stack fixed size memory resource traditionally extremely scant low end
Nested interrupt often provided exacerbates stack usage
A primary constraint interrupt handler programming endeavour exceed available stack condition requiring programmer reason globally stack space requirement every implemented interrupt handler application task
When allocated stack space exceeded condition known normally detected hardware chip class
If stack exceeded another writable memory area handler typically work expected application fail later sometimes much later due handler side effect memory corruption
If stack exceeded protected memory area failure usually occur inside handler generally easier case later debug
In writable case one implement sentinel stack fixed value right beyond end legal stack whose value overwritten never system operates correctly
It common regularly observe corruption stack guard kind watch dog mechanism
This catch majority stack overflow condition point time close offending operation
In multitasking system thread execution typically stack
If special system stack provided interrupt interrupt consume stack space whatever thread execution interrupted
These design usually contain MMU user stack usually configured stack overflow trapped MMU either system error debugging remap memory extend space available
Memory resource level microcontroller typically far le constrained stack allocated generous safety margin
In system supporting high thread count better hardware interrupt mechanism switch stack special system stack none thread stack need account nested interrupt usage
Tiny CPUs far back provided separate system user stack pointer
For many reason highly desired interrupt handler execute briefly possible highly discouraged forbidden hardware interrupt invoke potentially blocking system call
In system multiple execution core consideration also paramount
If system provides hardware issue arise even single CPU core
It uncommon microcontroller lack protection level MMU still provide DMA engine many channel scenario many interrupt typically DMA engine associated interrupt handler expected tread carefully
A modern practice evolved divide hardware interrupt handler element
The first level receives initial interrupt context running process minimal work restore hardware le urgent condition emptying full receive buffer mark second level execution near future appropriate scheduling priority invoked operates process context fewer restriction completes handler logical operation conveying newly received data operating system data queue
In several operating operating system used handler divided two part

Basically piece hardware hardware interrupt OS task software interrupt need run trigger interrupt
If interrupt masked ignored OS stop call special code handle new event
One good example reading hard drive
The drive slow want OS wait data come back want OS go thing
So set system disk data requested raise interrupt
In interrupt service routine disk CPU take data ready return requester
ISRs often need happen quickly hardware limited buffer overwritten new data pulled quickly enough
It also important ISR complete quickly CPU servicing one ISR interrupt masked mean CPU ca get quickly enough data lost
The best way understand make minimal example

In signal emitted hardware software indicating event need immediate attention
An interrupt alert processor condition requiring interruption current code processor executing
The processor responds suspending current activity saving executing called interrupt service routine ISR deal event
This interruption temporary interrupt handler finish processor resume normal activity
There two type interrupt hardware interrupt software interrupt

Internally hardware interrupt implemented using electronic alerting signal sent processor external device either part computer external
For example pressing key moving trigger hardware interrupt cause processor read keystroke mouse position
Unlike software type described hardware interrupt occur middle instruction execution requiring additional care programming
The act initiating hardware interrupt referred IRQ
A caused either exceptional condition processor special cause interrupt executed
The former often called used error event occurring program execution exceptional enough handled within program
For example exception thrown processor commanded divide number zero instruction error impossible
The operating system catch exception choose abort instruction
Software interrupt instruction function similarly used variety purpose request service like interrupt sent request reading writing data disk
Each interrupt interrupt handler

Setting clearing mask may faster accessing interrupt mask register IMR PIC disabling interrupt device
In case architecture disabling enabling interrupt processor act however may actually slower

Such interrupt four property An interrupt meet requirement called
The phenomenon overall system performance severely hindered excessive amount processing time spent handling interrupt called
A interrupt signaled maintaining interrupt line high low
A device wishing signal interrupt drive line active level high low hold level serviced
It cease asserting line CPU command otherwise handle condition caused signal interrupt
Typically processor sample interrupt input predefined time bus cycle state microprocessor
If interrupt active processor sample CPU see
One possible use type interrupt minimize spurious signal noisy interrupt line spurious pulse often short noticed
Multiple device may share interrupt line designed
The interrupt line must actively driven settle inactive state
Devices actively assert line indicate outstanding interrupt let line float actively drive signalling interrupt
The line asserted state one one sharing device signalling outstanding interrupt
interrupt favored easy share line without losing interrupt multiple shared device interrupt time
Upon detecting assertion interrupt line CPU must search device sharing line one triggered interrupt detected
After servicing device CPU may recheck interrupt line status determine whether device also need service
If line CPU avoids checking remaining device line
Since device interrupt frequently others device interrupt particularly expensive careful ordering device check employed increase efficiency
The original standard mandated interrupt advantage sharing interrupt
There also serious problem sharing interrupt
As long device line outstanding request service line remains asserted possible detect change status device
Deferring servicing device option would prevent detection service request device
If device line CPU know service interrupt device permanently block interrupt device
An interrupt signalled interrupt line either falling edge high low rising edge low high
A device wishing signal interrupt drive pulse onto line release line inactive state
If pulse short detected special hardware may required detect edge
Multiple device may share interrupt line designed
The interrupt line must resistor actively driven settle one particular state
Devices signal interrupt briefly driving line state let line float actively drive signalling interrupt
This type connection also referred
The line carry pulse generated device
This analogous bus trolley passenger pull signal driver requesting stop
However interrupt pulse different device may merge occur close time
To avoid losing interrupt CPU must trigger trailing edge pulse
rising edge line pulled driven low
After detecting interrupt CPU must check device service requirement
interrupt suffer problem interrupt sharing
Service device postponed arbitrarily interrupt continue received device serviced
If device CPU know service may cause spurious interrupt even periodic spurious interrupt interfere interrupt signalling device
However fairly easy edge triggered interrupt missed example interrupt masked period unless type hardware latch record event impossible recover
Such problem caused many lockup early computer hardware processor know expected something
More modern hardware often one interrupt status register latch interrupt request well written interrupt software often check register ensure event missed
The elderly ISA bus us interrupt mandate device able share
The also us interrupt
Many older device assume exclusive use interrupt line making electrically unsafe share
However ISA motherboards include resistor IRQ line device share ISA interrupt fine
Some system use hybrid signalling
The hardware look edge also verifies interrupt signal stay active certain period time
A common use hybrid interrupt NMI interrupt input
Because NMIs generally signal major even catastrophic system event good implementation signal try ensure interrupt valid verifying remains active period time
This approach help eliminate false interrupt affecting system
A use physical interrupt line
Instead device signal request service sending short message communication medium typically
The message might type reserved interrupt might type memory write
interrupt behave much like interrupt interrupt momentary signal rather continuous condition
software treat two much manner
Typically multiple pending interrupt message virtual interrupt line allowed merge closely spaced interrupt merge
shared extent underlying communication medium shared
No additional effort required
Because identity interrupt indicated pattern data bit requiring separate physical conductor many distinct interrupt efficiently handled
This reduces need sharing
Interrupt message also passed serial bus requiring additional line
serial computer bus us exclusively
In analogy applied term often used describe mechanism whereby system signal notify device work done
Typically software system place data mutually agreed upon memory location ring doorbell writing different memory location
This different memory location often called doorbell region may even multiple doorbell serving different purpose region
It act writing doorbell region memory ring bell notifies hardware device data ready waiting
The hardware device would know data valid acted upon
It would typically write data send etc
The term usually
It similar interrupt cause work done device however doorbell region sometimes implemented region sometimes doorbell region writes physical device sometimes doorbell region hardwired directly physical device register
When either writing directly physical device register may cause real interrupt occur device central processor unit one
Doorbell interrupt compared similarity
Multiple device sharing interrupt line triggering style act spurious interrupt source respect
With many device one line workload servicing interrupt grows proportion square number device
It therefore preferred spread device evenly across available interrupt line
Shortage interrupt line problem older system design interrupt line distinct physical conductor
interrupt interrupt line virtual favored new system architecture relieve problem considerable extent
Some device poorly designed programming interface provide way determine whether requested service
They may lock otherwise misbehave serviced want
Such device tolerate spurious interrupt also tolerate sharing interrupt line
card due often cheap design construction notorious problem
Such device becoming much rarer becomes cheaper new system architecture mandate shareable interrupt
Interrupts provide low overhead good low load degrade significantly high interrupt rate unless care taken prevent several pathology
These various form system spends time processing interrupt exclusion required task
Under extreme condition large number interrupt like high network traffic may completely stall system
To avoid problem must schedule network interrupt handling carefully schedule process execution
With processor additional performance improvement interrupt handling achieved RSS used
Such NICs provide multiple receive associated separate interrupt routing interrupt different core processing interrupt request triggered network traffic received single NIC distributed among multiple core
Distribution interrupt among core performed automatically operating system routing interrupt usually referred manually configured
A purely implementation receiving traffic distribution known RPS distributes received traffic among core later data path part functionality
Advantages RPS RSS include requirement specific hardware advanced traffic distribution filter reduced rate interrupt produced NIC
As downside RPS increase rate IPIs
RFS take approach accounting performance improvement achieved processing interrupt request core particular network packet consumed targeted application
Typical us interrupt include following system timer disk signal
Other interrupt exist transfer data byte using sense control motor anything else equipment must
Another typical use generate periodic interrupt dividing output crystal oscillator interrupt handler count interrupt order processor keep time
These periodic interrupt often used OS task reschedule priority running
Some older computer generated periodic interrupt controlled utility eliminate drift electric clock
For example disk interrupt signal completion data transfer disk peripheral process waiting read write file start
As another example interrupt predicts request loss power allowing computer equipment perform orderly
Also interrupt used feature buffering event like
Interrupts used allow emulation instruction unimplemented certain model computer line
For example instruction may implemented hardware system emulated system
Execution unimplemented instruction cause interrupt
The operating system interrupt handler recognize occurrence unimplemented instruction interpret instruction software routine return interrupting program instruction executed
This provides application software portability across entire line

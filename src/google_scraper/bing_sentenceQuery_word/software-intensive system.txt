term used field including refer software intensive system unprecedented amount hardware line source code number user volume data
The scale system give rise many problem developed used many stakeholder across multiple organization often conflicting purpose need constructed heterogeneous part complex dependency emergent property continuously evolving software hardware human failure norm exception
The term system introduced Northrop others describe challenge facing
The term subsequently used discus challenge many area including computerization financial market
The term system ULSS sometimes used interchangeably term complex IT system LSCITS
These two term introduced similar time describe similar problem former coined USA latter UK
The term system introduced report authored Linda Northrop colleague
The report explained software intensive system reaching unprecedented scale measure including line code number user stakeholder purpose system put amount data stored accessed manipulated refined number connection interdependency among component number hardware element
When system become traditional approach engineering management longer adequate
The report argues problem longer engineering engineering ecosystem
In Linda Northrop team conducted talk review outcome study reality
In summary talk concluded ULS system midst society change current social fabric institution significant b The original research team probably conservative report c Recent technology exacerbated pace scale growth There great opportunity
At similar time publication report Northrop others research training initiative initiated UK
Many challenge recognized initiative similar recognized challenge system
Greg Goth quote director UK initiative saying The ULSS proposal LSCITS proposal written entirely independently yet came similar conclusion need done
A difference pointed UK initiative began year vision Northrop much longer term
This seems led two slightly different perspective system
For example Richard Gabriel perspective system desirable currently impossible build due limitation field software design system engineering
On hand perspective system already emerging example air traffic control key problem achieve ensure adequately engineered
system hold characteristic system operationally independent managerially independent component evolutionary development emergent behavior geographic distribution
But addition Northrop report argues ULSS The Northrop report state sheer scale ULS system change everything
ULS system necessarily decentralized variety way developed used wide variety stakeholder conflicting need evolving continuously constructed heterogeneous part
People user ULS system element system
The reality software hardware failure fundamentally integrated design operation ULS system
The acquisition ULS system simultaneous operation require new method control

We need look differently system system system ecosystem
We face fundamental challenge design evolution orchestration control monitoring assessment ULS system
These challenge require breakthrough research
The Northrop report proposed ULS system research agenda interdisciplinary portfolio research least following area People key participant ULS system
Many problem complex system today stem failure individual organizational level
Understanding ULS system behavior depend view human element socially constituted computational process
This research involves anthropologist sociologist social scientist conducting detailed analysis user interaction field goal understanding construct evolve system effectively
ULS system must satisfy need participant multiple level organization
These participant often behave opportunistically meet objective
Some aspect ULS system programmed properly incentivizing constraining behavior rather explicitly prescribing
This research area explores use method tool based economics game theory mechanism design ensure globally optimal ULS system behavior exploiting strategic system constituency
This research area also includes exploring metaheuristics digital evolution augment cognitive limit human designer manage ongoing ULS system adaptation effectively
Current design theory method notation tool practice acquisition method support inadequate design ULS system effectively
This research area broadens traditional definition design include people organization social cognitive economic consideration design structure design rule government policy
It involves research support designing ULS system point view many level abstraction hardware software people organization work
New approach required enable intellectual control entirely new level scope scale system analysis design system defined many language abstraction semantic structure
This research area focus evolving expressiveness representation accommodate semantic diversity
Because complexity ULS system challenge human comprehension area also focus providing automated support computing behavior component composition system maintaining desired property ULS system evolve
ULS system require infrastructure permit organization distributed location work parallel develop select deploy evolve system component
This research area investigates integrated development environment runtime platform support decentralized nature ULS system
This research also focus technology method theory enable ULS system developed deployment environment
ULS system must operate robustly environment fraught failure overload attack
These system must maintain robustness presence adaptation centrally controlled authorized
Managing traditional quality security performance reliability usability necessary sufficient meet challenge ULS system
This research area focus maintain quality ULS system face continuous change ongoing failure attack
It also includes identifying predicting controlling new indicator system health akin gross domestic product needed scale ULS system
Policy management framework ULS system must address organizational technical operational policy level
Rules policy must developed automated enable fast effective local action preserving global capability
This research area focus transforming acquisition policy process accommodate rapid continuous evolution ULS system treating supplier supply chain intrinsic essential component ULS system
The proposed research supplant current important software research rather significantly expands horizon

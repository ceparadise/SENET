Dynamic programming algorithm often used
A dynamic programming algorithm examine previously solved subproblems combine solution give best solution given problem
In comparison treat solution sequence step pick locally optimal choice step
Using greedy algorithm guarantee optimal solution picking locally optimal choice may result bad global solution often faster calculate
Some greedy algorithm however proven lead optimal solution
For example finding minimum number coin given denomination needed make given amount dynamic programming algorithm would find optimal solution amount first finding optimal solution smaller amount using solution construct optimal solution larger amount
In contrast greedy algorithm might treat solution sequence coin starting given amount step subtracting largest possible coin denomination le current remaining amount
If coin denomination given amount greedy algorithm give solution optimal solution
In addition finding optimal solution problem dynamic programming also used counting number solution example counting number way certain amount change made given collection coin counting number optimal solution coin change problem described

Let consumption period assume consumption yield long consumer life
Assume consumer impatient future utility factor period
Let period
Assume initial capital given amount suppose period capital consumption determine next period capital positive constant
Assume capital negative
Then consumer decision problem written follows Written way problem look complicated involves solving choice variable
Note choice consumer initial capital taken given
The dynamic programming approach solve problem involves breaking apart sequence smaller decision
To define sequence represent value amount capital time
Note assumption utility capital death
The value quantity capital previous time calculated using
In problem Bellman equation This problem much simpler one wrote involves two decision variable
Intuitively instead choosing whole lifetime plan birth consumer take thing one step time
At time current capital given need choose current consumption saving
To actually solve problem work backwards
For simplicity current level capital denoted

Consider problem assigning value either zero one position matrix even row column contains exactly zero one
We ask many different assignment given
For example four possible solution There least three possible approach dynamic programming
Brute force consists checking assignment zero one counting balanced row column zero one
As possible assignment strategy practical except maybe
Backtracking problem consists choosing order matrix element recursively placing one zero checking every row column number element assigned plus number one zero least
While sophisticated brute force approach visit every solution making impractical larger six since number solution already shall see
Dynamic programming make possible count number solution without visiting
Imagine backtracking value first row information would require remaining row order able accurately count solution obtained first row value
We consider board whose row contain zero one
The function applied map vector pair integer number admissible board solution
There one pair column two component indicate respectively number zero one yet placed column
We seek value argument one vector element
The process subproblem creation involves iterating every one possible assignment top row board going every column subtracting one appropriate element pair column depending whether assignment top row contained zero one position
If one result negative assignment invalid contribute set solution recursion stop
Otherwise assignment top row board recursively compute number solution remaining board adding number solution every admissible assignment top row returning sum memoized
The base case trivial subproblem occurs board

That solution entire problem relies solution subproblems
Let u define function If find value function square rank pick minimum follow path backwards get shortest path
Note equal minimum cost get three square since square reach plus
For instance Now let u define somewhat general term The first line equation make recursive property simpler dealing edge need one recursion

In following pseudocode size board return minimum number value It noted function computes actual path
We get path soon
This like example horribly slow since waste time recomputing shortest path
However compute much faster fashion store array rather using function

Matrix chain multiplication example demonstrates utility dynamic programming
For example engineering application often multiply chain matrix
It surprising find matrix large dimension example
Therefore task multiply matrix
As know basic linear algebra matrix multiplication commutative associative multiply two matrix time
So multiply chain matrix many different way example
There numerous way multiply chain matrix
They produce final result however take le time compute based particular matrix multiplied
If matrix A dimension matrix B dimension matrix dimension require scalar multiplication using simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm purpose illustration
For example let u multiply matrix A B Let u assume dimension respectively
Matrix size calculated two way shown Let u assume n p
So first way multiply chain require calculation
The second way require calculation
Obviously second way faster multiply matrix using arrangement parenthesis
Therefore conclusion order parenthesis matter task find optimal order parenthesis
At point several choice one design dynamic programming algorithm split problem overlapping problem calculate optimal arrangement parenthesis

For example multiplying chain turn mean optimal placement parenthesis matrix multiply matrix require scalar calculation
This algorithm produce table entry possible value j
The final solution entire chain n corresponding split n
Unraveling solution recursive starting top continuing reach base case
multiplication single matrix
Therefore next step actually split chain
place parenthesis optimally belong
For purpose could use following algorithm Of course algorithm useful actual multiplication
This algorithm way see result look like
To actually multiply matrix using proper split need following algorithm The term originally used describe process solving problem one need find best decision one another

Sorry advance question sound dumb As far I know building algorithm using dynamic programming work way As far I know I said everything dynamic programming
I mean dynamic programming give expressing recurrence relation turning code
So special dynamic programming
What give vague method approaching certain kind problem
Dynamic programming give way think algorithm design
This often helpful
Memoization method give turning recurrence relation code
Memoization relatively simple idea best idea often
Dynamic programming give structured way think running time algorithm
The running time basically determined two number number subproblems solve time take solve subproblem
This provides convenient easy way think algorithm design problem
When candidate recurrence relation look quickly get sense running time might instance often quickly tell many subproblems lower bound running time exponentially many subproblems solve recurrence probably wo good approach
This also help rule candidate subproblem decomposition
For instance string S defining subproblem prefix S suffix S substring S might reasonable number subproblems polynomial n defining subproblem subsequence S likely good approach number subproblems exponential n
This let prune search space possible recurrence
Dynamic programming give structured approach look candidate recurrence relation
Empirically approach often effective
In particular pattern recognize common way define subproblems depending type input
For instance If input n one candidate way define subproblem replacing n smaller integer n
n n
If input S candidate way define subproblem include replace S prefix S replace S suffix S replace S substring S
Here subproblem determined choice j
If input string
If input T one candidate way define subproblem replace T subtree T pick node x replace T subtree rooted x subproblem determined choice x
If input pair x recursively look type x type identify way choose subproblem
In word one candidate way define subproblem replace x x x subproblem x subproblem
You also consider subproblems form x x
And
This give useful heuristic looking method come list candidate way define subproblems
In word looking problem statement looking input come handful candidate way define subproblem
This often helpful
It tell recurrence relation particular choice define subproblem often hard work corresponding recurrence relation
So often turn design dynamic programming algorithm structured experience
You write scrap paper list candidate way define subproblems using heuristic
Then candidate try write recurrence relation evaluate running time counting number subproblems time spent per subproblem
After trying candidate keep best one able find
Providing structure algorithm design process major help otherwise algorithm design intimidating huge space possible approach without structure unclear even get started
Your understanding dynamic programming correct question justified
I think additional design space get kind recurrence call dynamic programming best seen comparison schema recursive approach
Let pretend input array A sake highlighting concept
Here idea make problem smaller solve smaller version derive solution original one
Schematically f A f A A g translates solution
Partition input several smaller part solve problem combine
Schematically two part f A f A f A
Shortest pairwise distance plane Consider way partitioning problem smaller problem pick best
Schematically two part f A best f A f A c
Edit distance problem
The application best every step reduces search space considerably
In sense know statically going top bottom make decision dynamically
The lesson learning dynamic programming try possible partitioning well required correctness still efficient using memoization
Dynamic Programming allows trade memory computation time
Consider classic example Fibonacci
Fibonacci defined recurrence Fib n
If solve using recursion end O call Fib since recursion tree binary tree height n
Instead want calculate Fib use find Fib use find Fib etc
This take O n time
DP also provides u basic technique translating recurrence relation solution relatively straightforward generally involve using dimensional matrix frontier matrix number parameter recurrence relation
These well explained text DP
Here another slightly different way phrasing dynamic programming give
Dynamic programming collapse exponential number candidate solution polynomial number equivalence class candidate solution class indistinguishable sense
Let take example problem finding number increasing subsequence length k array A lenght n
It useful partition set subsequence equivalence class two subsequence belong class length end index
All possible subsequence belong exactly one O equivalence class
This partitioning preserve enough information define recurrence relation size class
If f give number subsequence end index length f j A j A f j f n This recurrence solves problem time O

There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine
Perhaps need scroll right bit

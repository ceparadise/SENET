Modern computer system networked together correlated telecommunication network span entire planet beyond frighteningly highlighted
This necessitates method identifying individual computer connected network computer IP address come
Like street address affixed house within postal system allows computer send information computer receive information turn
This essential every networked activity undertaken online sending email playing video game want get technical establishing internet connection first place
However billion possible IP address billion device using
The value either procedurally generated assigned manually within given network possible IP conflict two separate device given address
So IP address conflict exactly one happen resolved
An IP address conflict result network small enough immediate concern data sent received normally conflict resolved layer networking separating two device
Usually involves multiple computer connected LAN local area In case term computer phrase anything connected internet whole device requires IP address
This includes mobile internet device traditional computer network adapter router wearable gadget internet connectivity
Related Resource The number possible IP address loosened additional line information two house located Chestnut Street confusing unless one located city Anywhere Alaska identified Somewhere South Dakota allows respective location clearly differentiated
This fundamentally IP address work different number assigned within local regional network information routed successively localized network reach individual computer
Most frequently IP address conflict result human error system administrator might assign static IP address two computer local area network network device connected directly usually cable mistake
It possible malfunction result IP address assigned multiple computer automatically although dynamic IP address address change periodically help correct issue
The solution IP address conflict depends upon nature generated first place
In case conflict two manually entered static IP address instance conflict resolved changing one address rebooting system
In case glitch involving dynamic IP address issue addressed process known releasing renewing device IP address
This conceptually comparable idea filing change address form post office trained network technician operating help desk relatively simple matter covered every certification program
In case inexplicable network outage step usually taken preliminary measure case
An IP address conflict may also result bad router within home institutional network case upgrading router basic operating software usually fix problem service provider usually make upgrade available website
IP conflict bring entire network also readily addressed standard procedure
A trained network professional help desk operator usually resolve IP address conflict minute
The common fix quick easily implemented require little take effect put place simple reboot local system

In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

On wikipedia page describes pretty well CDCL algorithm seems picture taken slide created Sharad Malik Princeton
However describing backtrack say appropriate point
MiniSAT also us variant CDCL algorithm I read
What seem say backtrack learned clause unit clause
That certainly clarification make sense
The last assignment definitely going part learned conflict clause far I tell perhaps I wrong
backtrack one step immediately make learned clause unit last assigned value flip algorithm proceed exactly DPLL without ever backtracking sufficiently far
Additionally wikipedia page follow rule backtracks much seems desirable
How far one supposed backtrack
Here relevant paragraph MiniSAT paper The decision phase continue either variable assigned case model conflict occurred
On conflict learning procedure invoked conflict clause producted
The trail used undo decision one level time precisely one literal learnt clause becomes unbound False point conflict
By construction conflict clause go directly conflict clause two unbound literal
If clause remains unit several decision level advantageous chose sic lowest level referred
A point seem missed learned clause becomes unit due undone assignment backtracking solver stop
There could assignment one bearing current conflict experimentally shown better undo unrelated assignment also
So solver continues undo assignment next undo would make learned clause
would contain one unassigned variable
The solver stop run unit propagation satisfy unit clause resume search assigning variable normally
Note also current decision variable may present learned clause
A common strategy CDCL solver find use variable learned clause
In case first UIP decision variable often

Photo courtesy Philip Guo started programming I first Logo BASIC
The picture age horrible posture
By time photo taken I already written several BASIC game I distributed shareware local BBS
I fast growing bored parent software engineer gave original grad school day
That I started learning C writing simple interpreter compiler
My early interpreter BASIC time I entered high school I already created nontrivial subset Throughout high school I spent weekend coding assembly obsessed code newly released
When I started freshman year MIT computer science major I already year programming experience
So I felt right home
OK lie
With one exception That photo
When taken I even know
My parent like Quick pose front new computer Look closely
My finger even right position
My parent humanity major single programming book house
In sixth grade I tried teaching BASIC week quit hard
The real exposure I programming prior college taking AP computer science grade taught math teacher learned material
Despite shortcoming class inspired major computer science college
But I started freshman year MIT I felt bit anxious many classmate actually year childhood programming experience I le one
Even though I grow household could code way paper bag I one big thing going I I good programming
Here freshman year college Photo courtesy Philip Guo As Asian male student MIT I fit society image young programmer
Thus throughout college nobody ever said said CS student I knew Although I started complete novice like everyone I never faced impeded intellectual growth
Throughout college grad school I gradually learned via class research internship incrementally taking harder harder project getting better better programming falling deeper deeper love
Instead age I mine age
And nobody ever got way even I looked like sort person would good thing
The software engineer Tess Rinearson writes dynamic different perspective essay Instead facing implicit bias I privilege implicit endorsement
For instance whenever I attended technical meeting people would assume I knew I regardless whether I treat accordingly
If I stared someone silence nodded talking would assume I understood I clueless
Nobody ever talked I always got benefit doubt technical setting
As result I able fake till I made often landing job whose posting required skill I yet learned knew I could pick spot
Most interview research assistantships summer internship quite gave chance try
And enough round practice I actually start knowing I
As I gained experience I able land meaningful programming job led virtuous cycle improvement
For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender
This kind privilege I people looked like possessed silent manifested people said u rather say
We spend enormous amount time developing technical expertise without anyone interference implicit discouragement
Sure worked really hard effort directly translated skill improvement without much loss due interpersonal friction
Because looked part
In contrast ask computer science major majority demographic white Asian male I guarantee encountered discouraging comment You know everyone cut computer They probably still remember word action hurt even though often trying harm
For example one good friend took course freshman year enjoyed
She wanted get better Java GUI programming got summer research assistantship MIT Media Lab
However instead letting build GUI like job ad described supervisor assigned task audio clip summer long
He assigned new male student build GUI application
And like student programming also freshman amount limited experience
The student spent summer getting better GUI programming grinded away mindlessly transcribing audio
As result grew resentful shied away learning CS
Thinking story always anger
Here someone natural interest took initiative learn denied opportunity
I doubt friend could gotten good really enjoyed opportunity I
It help accepted MIT son saying Well got MIT Over decade later programming research job wish learned back college
However negative association everything hard motivate fear shot
One trite retort Well friend tougher given easily
If wanted badly enough tried even knowing might face These sort remark aggravate
Writing code living like Navy SEAL
Programming seriously demanding need superhero enter profession
Just look photo software engineering summer internship Photo courtesy Philip Guo Even though I hacking hardware simulator sound mildly I actually pretty squishy chillin cubicle often taking extended lunch break
All guy around yes programmer men exception one older woman hang u also fairly squishy
These guy made fine living good superheroes
The hardship one guy faced summer staying late playing rolling office next morning
Anyone enough practice motivation could done job programming job well
Seriously company looking hire next Steve want ship code work
It frustrates people majority demographic often need tough nail succeed field constantly bearing lasting effect thousand
according one researcher Mary Rowe In contrast people look like kinda programming work want switch later work quietly suck rock whatever
And nobody make remark appearance whether truly dedicated hacker behavior might reflect badly kind people
silent technical privilege
Ideally want spur interest young people underrepresented demographic might never otherwise think pursue CS STEM study
There great people organization working toward goal
Although I think increased broader participation critical immediate concern reducing attrition already field
For instance according That I plan start taking step encourage retain already want learn
So thought experiment For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender exact initial interest aptitude level
Would still willing devote hour deliberate practice achieve mastery face dozen hundred instance implicit discouragement would inevitably encounter year
Sure outlier would many would
Many u would quit even though potential interest thrive field
As older Black male life go extra mile reach others starting line I could prouder author empathy
I hope live future people already interest pursue CS programming field
I want people experience I privileged enough gotten college beyond unimpeded opportunity develop expertise something find beautiful practical fulfilling

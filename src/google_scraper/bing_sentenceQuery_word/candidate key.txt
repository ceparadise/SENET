A candidate key column set column table uniquely identify database record without referring data
Each table may one candidate key one candidate key unique called primary key
This usually best among candidate key use identification
When key composed one column known composite key
The best way define candidate key example
For example bank database designed
To uniquely define customer account combination customer birth date sequential number account used
So Andrew Smith checking account numbered saving account
A candidate key created
This raise problem
What one person birth date want open account bank
Because potential pitfall frequently used option create unique candidate key
In case bank database issue unique account number guaranteed prevent problem highlighted
For good measure account number logic
For example checking account begin C followed year month creation within month sequential number
So Andrew Smith checking account
Even without referring elsewhere teller identify checking account created May
Savings account follow logic S instead Note possible uniquely identify account using aforementioned birth date sequential number candidate key potentially used identify record
However much better way thing demonstrated creating candidate key
In fact chosen candidate key good certainly uniquely identify every record used primary key
All database allow definition one one primary key per table

A candidate key combination attribute uniquely used identify database record without referring data
Each table may one candidate
One candidate key selected table
A table contains one primary key contain several candidate key
If candidate key composed two column called composite key
All candidate key common property
One property lifetime candidate key attribute used identification must remain
Another value null
Lastly candidate key must unique
For example uniquely identify employee company might use employee
As see people first name last name position two people ever Social Security number
Some type data readily lend candidate However type information might seem like good candidate actually prove problematic There error

What difference Primary key candidate key
Before seeing difference Candidate key Primary key let see similarity bullet point
Both Primary Candidate key uniquely identify record table database
Both Primary Candidate key constraint UNIQUE NOT NULL
Primary key Candidate key either single column combination multiple column table
Now difference Candidate key primary key SQL table point format easy remember There multiple Candidate key table relation database
Sybase MSSQL oneprimary key permitted
An example Primary key Candidate key ID SSN number Employee table Since identify employee uniquely candidate key one become primary key
Now choose asprimary key I go ID SSN sensitive information may safe use String query frequently ID
Second reason choosing ID SSN primary key use ID primary That difference Primary key Candidate key table
Primary key set one table uniquely identify record database table
It accept null duplicate value
Only one Candidate Key Primary Key
A Candidate Key set one identify record uniquely table
There multiple Candidate Keys one table
Each Candidate Key work Primary Key

Read article http answer following question
Post summary essential point article

The author discus three fundamental demand candidate key must never deviate become subject
Do agree statement
Justify answer
Article Candidate key Choosing right primary key It knowledge entity thing importance kind unique separate invoice number customer IDs
Your role validate property fit normalized model reflects need business
During discover many candidate key issue concerning primary key defined
With wrong primary key decision chance high worse job normalizing database model well achieve high performing database end
Read separate eBook database normalization
Three absolute demand candidate primary key regarded possible primary key
There three fundamental demand candidate key must never deviate become subject primary key
The candidate key must unique within domain entity represents beyond also intend access external entity

The candidate key hold NULL value NULL zero
Zero number
NULL value

The candidate key never change
It must hold value given occurrence entity lifetime entity
In say main purpose candidate key help u identify one single regardless whether exists billion row
This set high demand flexibility term delivering uniqueness
In say candidate key always without must hold value
Without break post
In say matter happens inside business outside allowed change value candidate key
Adding expanding candidate key would pose change
Some say able change primary key update underlying table
We deal later chapter
If candidate key withstand three demand likely identified primary key
As proceed eBook keep three demand mind

excerpt eBook
check Primary Foreign Keys
We also used plural form entity name well table name
The normal singular form entity plural table
We done exception reading purpose
Details uniqueness A primary key stated earlier post column collection column together give u ability uniquely read one single row table matter many row exists table
In logical world theory physical get lot trouble unable
Consider simple example You want give pay raise top DBA John Wilson
You writing UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET SALARY SALARY WHERE NAME Wilson If two employee name get pay raise
Not exactly intended Names unlikely candidate primary key
You need something unique name unique
Never
Details null value In post null value primary key How identify something know
This point go without saying I bring believe I read article claiming exists possibility weak primary key meaning null value allowed
Absolutely nonsense
All meaning term primary key vanishes thin air
Most serious database system actually disclose attempt deny go path good reason
If ever come across situation defy
It path failure
Actually discussion
Details change Think Africa
After
World War end colonialism many country changed name
A recent example There longer country called The Union Soviet Socialist Republics Today call Russia
We even standard naming country former Russia known world USSR Russia abbreviated RUS today
Look two fantastic table Fig
Country definition United Nations Another table country definition ISO standardization organization Is great
Western Samoa abbreviated WSM United Nations abbreviated WS ISO
It even identifier ISO WS WSM
Take look USSR Sorry RUS In United Nations call RUS ISO use RUS RU
But according FIPS abbreviated RS
How identify country using standard helpful people
If search Google term country code without quote find site two table among first ten hit
Do go ISO page actually want walk around shopping cart pay
In every column candidate key No two country name shortcut name differ put broader perspective In ISO name Russia latest determined standard abbreviation RU United Nations name country Russian Federation abbreviation RUS
Furthermore FIPS abbreviation RS
Do never meet talk
Looking isolated column Fig
also candidate key
But want match entry Fig
Fig

Actually I find one common denominator Both ISO UN give Russia common number
Here something investigate
Are abbreviation name meant organization share number identification
Have talking
It clear rely character column either organization While candidate key world would soon get trouble tried use talk world outside scope little application
As see defining choosing right primary key necessarily simple task
How another case You manufacturer one customer place behalf customer asking use customer customer number identification How long take another customer sheer coincidence supply id let u say totally different company
You organize system way uniquely identify information going system regardless external system regardless external change
That bottom line You make primary key foolproof
Candidate key Choosing right primary key
SUMMARY This article Primary key importance designing database model reflect actual need business designed
The role data base fit property requirement business normalized database
This important designing high performing data base
To make sure one meet business requirement author outline three fundamental requirement candidate key must meet become primary key
The author support statement example badly defined primary key problem pose transaction entity
The three fundamental requirement outlined
The candidate key must unique within domain entity table
This solution contains summary article choosing right primary key

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I definitely checked many different related post
I also done different sample problem online source well similar problem
However I stuck problem specifically
Given following relation R set functional dependency S hold R find candidate key R
Show work
R A B C D E F S AB C AC B AD E BC A E F Initially I broke attribute group attribute found left right side D ABCE F respectively
I also know I try compute closure D
This I get stuck
At first glance seems like I unable solve problem true
I also tried computing closure AD BD CD ED I thought closure D D
Any thought
You right start closure attribute
Finding closure help finding candidate key
There might efficient way go
What work least look given functional dependency
If none single attribute side bother finding closure individual attribute

given R A B C FDs A C B A closure individual attribute A B C respectively A B C
Here though one FD side F
The closure E E plus whatever E determine F thus E E F
Now figured closure individual attribute
But go far since rest FDs two attribute side
You calculate closure say A B
Automatically add A B closure since attribute determines
Now look set given FDs see one go A C
Since already A B inside closure attribute FD side closure add whatever attribute side closure
So closure A B A B C
Essentially keep building larger closure ultimate goal finding closure encompass entire set attribute
In case candidate key three
Try calculating closure A B D
You know automatically A B D go inside
You also add whatever attribute closure subset A B D A B
Thus add C closure look like A B C D
Now check list given FDs see A E added since A D inside closure
Thus closure A B C D E
Finally add FD F
And completes set attribute relation
Here useful tool checking work You use check work calculating closure candidate key
Follow following step Check attribute present RHS Functional Dependencies FDs attribute derived present candidate key
D case Check closure D D derive attribute candidate key Start checking closure pair attribute include AD BD CD Closure AD A D E F derive candidate key Closure BD B D candidate key Closure CD C D candidate key Start checking closure chunk attribute include ABD BCD ACD Closure ABD A B D C E F attribute covered Candidate key Closure BCD B C D A E F attribute covered Candidate key Closure ACD A C D E F B attribute covered Candidate Key Start checking closure chunk attribute include ABCD But ABCD super key ABD OR BCD OR ACD candidate key
Thus candidate key ABD BCD ACD

Database structure generally divided two respect namely flat database relational database
Relational database easier understand flat database
Because relational database simple design easy data operation
Database also relational structure found table store data
On table consists column row column define type information saved
Basically database useful time retain information categorized logically
For example want save information data database enterprise school group matter business become table
In database relationship relationship one one many many one many The key set column used identify access particular row row
Identified key explanatory table index constraint reference
The column part one key
A unique key key constrained two value
Unique key column contain NULL
For example column number employee defined unique key value column identifies one employee
No two employee number worker
The mechanism used enforce uniqueness index unique key
Unique index table column collection ordered column identifies value specify function unique row
A unique index contain NULL
The key one unique key defined table selected first important key
There one primary key table
A primary index automatically created primary key
The main index used database manager efficient access table row allows database manager enforce uniqueness primary key
You also specify index key column efficiently access data processing query
If table natural unique key order arrival method used distinguish unique row use time stamp part key help
Weld Line Automation Weld Line Programming If column table contains duplicate determine key one column
A key one column composite key
The combination column value define unique entity
If composite key easily defined also considered create new column unique
A foreign key field table corresponding relationship candidate key table
Foreign key used table
For example suppose two table customer includes customer data order table includes customer order
Intention order must associated client customer table
To place foreign key order table relates key customer table
Identifying foreign key column set column table refers column set column another table
Column table must reference key pillar super key referenced table
Value reference column line must occur single row referenced table
Thus row reference table contain value exist referenced table except potentially null
In way reference made link information together important part database normalization
Various row table reference may refer row referenced table
Most time reflects parent table reference table many child table referencing table relationship
Below example relationship Company also schedule Contact
Tables company parent link
In child contact schedule Field CompanyID table show contact contacted company owned
Diversification foreign key defines many record child table link record master table
In example child diversity since company number contact
Primary Key Foreign Key Relationship It Primary Foreign Key figure relationship two key

One One One Many Many Many
This indicated Key field equivalent schedule
show field identifies unique record
For example product Order value normally produced field
intrinsic meaning integer automatically generated one one
This indicated field table
In case field also created key example attitude Schedule Key Primary Key Table composite key consisting two field
The Primary Key table Primary Key table
common real world easy read Parents child
In figure show One Product attributed Many
The line product continuous line small dotted line
This mean field Primary Key Table
A dotted line show existence Foreign Key
Relationship important real world able see around u every day
For example many customer may order product
Many product ordered customer
This called Relationship
It implemented directly Database Table relationship
The solution create intermediate table record combination exist Customer Product
For example customer ordered three product three record customer intermediate table
Low key combination parent table primary key intermediate table
We also need allow comment like stronger
If get right database structure easy extend
Explain main characteristic advantage following term
Relational Database b Object Oriented Database c Object Relational Database Can connected database collection data item strongly recommended set name Minister Finance official explained Any data easily accessible
A database created using model relation relationship
The software used database relation database management system called Relations
A relationship database preferred choice storing data compared model hierarchical database model network model
The first database commenced namely Edgar Codd
data update easy without change information different file
info always date chance remaining old data forgotten file
typo avoid problem data type Excel dreaded syndrome
avoid unwanted conversion like November November validated data data entry filter impossible data existing information
With database combine different data easily
No force data different format
Do away intermediate Excel spreadsheet often generated manipulating data
And often dare delete case contain important information
Data manipulation done using query
This mean Structured Query Language SQL merge update manage data user need know SQL perform complex task
In Microsoft Access example Visual Query Builder provides simple intuitive interface make query
A database adjusted reveal new area investigation present large quantity data intuitive form
Often pattern become apparent data
With special database possible new way data many different source brought together displayed quickly fast
Ends Excel file subtlety different
Never sure correct file delete case
With relational database dilemma past
Your data set analysis created using query stored database
No copy made data instead link query directly statistic
The main goal development guarantee system enjoy longer life maintenance cost much le
This process system contained behavior reused included recent behavior
The ultimate goal new development Objects operational system prone model real world complete fashion traditional method
Objects organized class object behavior
Based object rather data processing system far reliable traditional system especially new behavior built existing object
Because object dynamically called accessible new object created time
New object inherit data attribute one many object
Behavior inherited novel behavior added without performing function existing system
Database Object capability expanded additional tie new data type access method function available object oriented programming
add character string data type
Complex data type combine feature data type already exist database
able determine data type text containing desired time number byte used create user defined data type opaque
also add virtual processor
By using encapsulation database object want contact form table
For example Table includes name address phone number email address contact
Through class encapsulating Contacts combine information table one
So query database information generate report style designed include information

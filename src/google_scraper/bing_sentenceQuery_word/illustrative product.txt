It difficult one define
Most people gut feeling line graphic design illustration
My understanding always Illustrators designer use similar tool similar skill training
Most illustrator competant designer designer competant illustrator
There lot overlap two discipline
It common see course title like Graphic Design And Illustration
In term skill involved illustration generally expressive image create subjective mood graphic design deliberate image achieve objective goal
Here example taken clothing site design made illustrator also designer example illustration
It really strong expressive style creates mood bringing mind bike chaotic thing energy without needing look directly
It need attention work look directly try direct attention around eye wanders around freely
example graphic design
It attracts attention strong clear focal image us visual hierarchy pas attention smaller image carry deliberate meaning bike needing fuel
It work attention controlled deliberate way
somewhere two graphic design illustration
It creates whimsical mood even look directly attracts directs attention deliberate set way attention communicates deliberate message pay direct attention
A lot
design work somewhere two like
Illustrations often carry deliberate meaning usually reframing meaning thing illustrates example illustration child book visually show action described text
A good child book illustration add depth enhances simple text without competing
Graphics often designed give abstract impression mood personality usually carefully controlled analysed deliberate way example good corporate logo meet lot specific requirement used function well giving impression abstract company
It fuzzy line two discipline
Adobe Illustrator particular vector based illustration program made Adobe
Illustrator person illustrates
Typically world Graphic Design would person take concept art director editor creates visual via drawing painting
In almost every way I agree I little add except excerpt book I also recommend Illustration long history existence century recognised distinct discipline fairly recently
It often confused discipline notably graphic design fine art perhaps sometimes overlap
However illustration communicating specific contextualised message audience
It rooted objective need fulfil particular task
Illustrators need knowledge understanding insight regarding context within working subject matter work within parameter need target audience
They need utilise breath intellectual practical skill might regarded transferable discipline considered essential illustrator ambition transcend role commissioned
I total noob sure
But I think Illustrator referring vector based graphic program create image based mathematical formula therefore scale well
Adobe Illustrator everything enlarged decreased numerical factor
The alternative program
Adobe Photoshop modify individual pixel therefore good working thing like photograph lot slightly different color
The question easier answer word What mean TO BE illustrator
The question illustrator
This strictly opinion To illustrator create original art hand pencil paint charcoal etc art based computer program accompany enhance idea
A example base idea may written story program poster group singer would like illustrate highlight song theme song
However illustrator keep mind base idea important accompanying art

Some product contain infinitely many term
For product relatively term number multiplicand written one another separated multiplication sign x
An example x x
This becomes awkward number term large
When product infinitely many term term must occur definable sequence
This sequence always clear term simply listed separated multiplication symbol
For reason product symbol devised large uppercase Greek letter pi
To denote x x following symbology used The expression side equation product
The value always integer
It usually start always increase succeeding term product
Suppose sequence multiplicand extended without limit according obvious pattern
Then product unlimited value x x x x denoted like The sideways called mean continues increase without limit
It imprecise say dealing product terminology often used anyway

An emphasis placed information system definitive boundary user processor storage input output aforementioned communication network
Any specific information system aim support operation management
An information system ICT organization us also way people interact technology support business process
Some author make clear distinction information system
Information system typically include ICT component purely concerned ICT focusing instead end use information technology
Information system also different business process
Information system help control performance business process
Alter argues advantage viewing information system special type
A work system system human machine perform process activity using resource produce specific product service customer
An information system work system whose activity devoted capturing transmitting storing retrieving manipulating displaying information
As information system one hand activity system
An information system form system data represent processed form social memory
An information system also considered support human decision making action
Information system primary focus study
Silver et al
provided two view IS includes software hardware data people procedure
Zheng provided another also add process essential element like environment boundary purpose interaction
The defines Information system specialist focus ing integrating information technology solution business process meet information need business enterprise
There various type information system example office information system
Critical information system information technology typically designed enable human perform task human brain well suited handling large amount information performing complex calculation controlling many simultaneous process
Information technology important malleable resource available executive
Many company created position CIO sits executive board CEO CFO COO CTO
The CTO may also serve CIO vice versa
The CISO focus information security management
The six component must come together order produce information system Information system organizational procedure need computer software data erroneous IE accounting system using ledger ink utilizes information system Data bridge hardware people
This mean data collect data involve people
At point data information
The classic view Information system found textbook pyramid system reflected hierarchy organization usually bottom pyramid followed ending top
Although pyramid model remains useful since first formulated number new technology developed new category information system emerged longer fit easily original pyramid model
Some example system A essentially IS using computer technology carry planned task
The basic component information system The first four component hardware software database network make known information technology platform
Information technology worker could use component create information system watch safety measure risk management data
These action known information technology service
Certain information system support part organization others support entire organization still others support group organization
Recall department functional area within organization collection application program information system
These functional area information system FAIS supporting pillar general IS namely system
As name suggest FAIS support particular function within organization
accounting IS finance IS production operation management POM IS marketing IS human resource IS
In finance accounting manager use IT system forecast revenue business activity determine best source us fund perform audit ensure organization fundamentally sound financial report document accurate
Other type organizational information system FAIS system executive dashboard system
Dashboards special form IS support manager organization

Expert system attempt duplicate work human expert applying reasoning capability knowledge expertise within specific domain
Information technology department larger organization tend strongly influence development use application information technology organization
A series methodology process used develop use information system
Many developer use engineering approach SDLC systematic procedure developing information system stage occur sequence
Recent research aim enabling measuring ongoing collective development system within organization entirety human actor
An information system developed house within organization outsourced
This accomplished outsourcing certain component entire system
A specific case geographical distribution development team
A information system following definition technologically implemented medium land information system disaster information system example emerging information system broadly considered spatial information system
System development done stage include The field study called encompasses variety topic including system analysis design computer networking information security database management decision support system

Information system bridge using theoretical foundation study various business model related process building IT system within computer science discipline
field studying computer algorithmic process including principle software hardware design application impact society whereas IS emphasizes functionality design
Several IS scholar debated nature foundation Information Systems root reference discipline others
Information system also defined collection hardware software data people procedure work together produce quality information
Similar computer science discipline seen related foundation discipline IS
The domain study IS involves study theory practice related social technological phenomenon determine development use effect information system organization society
But may considerable overlap discipline boundary discipline still differentiated focus purpose orientation activity
In broad scope term scientific field study address range strategic managerial operational activity involved gathering processing storing distributing use information associated technology society organization
The term information system also used describe organizational function applies IS knowledge industry government agency organization
often refers interaction algorithmic process technology
This interaction occur within across organizational boundary
An information system technology organization us also way organization interact technology way technology work organization business process
Information system distinct IT information system information technology component interacts process component
One problem approach prevents IS field interested use ICT social networking computer gaming mobile personal usage etc
A different way differentiating IS field neighbour ask Which aspect reality meaningful IS field field

Information Systems worker enter number different career There wide variety career path information system discipline
Workers specialized technical knowledge strong communication skill best prospect
Workers management skill understanding business practice principle excellent opportunity company increasingly looking technology drive revenue
Information technology important operation contemporary business offer many employment opportunity
The information system field includes people organization design build information system people use system people responsible managing system
The demand traditional IT staff programmer business analyst system analyst designer significant
Many job exist area Information technology
At top list chief information officer CIO
The CIO executive charge IS function
In organization CIO work chief executive officer CEO chief financial officer CFO senior executive
Therefore actively participates organization strategic planning process
Information system research generally interdisciplinary concerned study effect information system behaviour individual group organization
Hevner et al
categorized research IS two scientific paradigm including develop verify theory explain predict human organizational behavior extends boundary human organizational capability creating new innovative artifact
Salvatore March Gerald Smith proposed framework researching different aspect Information Technology including output research research output activity carry research research activity
They identified research output follows Also research activity including Although Information Systems discipline evolving year core focus identity IS research still subject debate among scholar
There two main view around debate narrow view focusing IT artifact core subject matter IS research broad view focus interplay social technical aspect IT embedded dynamic evolving context
A third view call IS scholar pay balanced attention IT artifact context
Since study information system applied field industry practitioner expect information system research generate finding immediately applicable practice
This always case however information system researcher often explore behavioral issue much depth practitioner would expect
This may render information system research result difficult understand led criticism
In last ten year business trend represented considerable increasing Information Systems Function ISF role especially regard enterprise strategy operation supporting
It became increase productivity support new value creation
To study information system rather effect information system model used

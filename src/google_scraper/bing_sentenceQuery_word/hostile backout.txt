Riddle Lee College ISA product service organized technical topic selection technology trend area focus relevant performance The electronic component digital computer operate certain condition temperature humidity cleanliness electrical current meet certain specification
Failure respect condition may cause component fail function erratically
computer use home office environment offer threat electronic component
Their design therefore provides minimal protection adverse condition
One way increase level protection change design computer incorporate rugged component
An extreme example battle hardening computer military equipment
case mounting electronics measure improve odds computer survival hostile environment
This approach however entail substantial increase cost especially solving environmental problem may create others
For example sealing outer case computer exclude water dirt harmful vapor also cut air circulation resulting excessively high temperature inside unless one add large heat sink cooling system
For reason many industrial computer installation use approach enclosing unmodified computer protective room environment suitable computer maintainable
However latest distributed control system use industrial environment
Note programmable logic controller PLCs situation somewhat different
PLCs designed outset function plant floor environmental requirement therefore le stringent
This mean however PLCs need protection
They vulnerable environmental threat computer somewhat le
Dust dirt quickly form blanket accessible surface computer
The layer dirt may prevent physical contact closing keyboard may clog ventilation opening
If dust conductive may cause short circuit insulating may lead heat buildup component failure
The obvious preventive dust infiltration minimize number opening dust enter
This approach work many PLCs industrially hardened computer although may create heat dissipation problem
The approach filter air either inlet computer room go particular opening computer case
This method work well filter medium appropriate contaminant one swap filter regularly
Another simple though possibly unpopular measure ban smoking vicinity computer
Chemical vapor corrosive eat away contact conductive trace inside computer eventually breaking electrical continuity
They also damage data recording surface disk
The usual defense chemical vapor either make computer control room tight vapor question install appropriate filter
It may necessary set computer room distance source chemical vapor ensure remain sufficiently low concentration
Water get computer two way direct splash installation near process equipment using water accidental spillage condensation
Obviously water cause catastrophic short circuit inside computer chronic water problem also lead corrosion failure component
The operating specification computer include humidity range within computer function
Designing entire computer watertight difficult heat dissipation requirement watertight keyboard key pad frequently serve plant floor connect computer nearby protected room
Keeping coffee cup source nonprocess liquid safe distance computer sensible preventive measure
Condensation usually result low temperature extremely high humidity ambient air
If problem local one may use heater raise temperature lower relative humidity given air moisture content per unit volume
In environmentally controlled room humidifier dehumidifier may also used
An air conditioning system control temperature humidity
The vibration often accompanies operating process equipment break contact solder joint inside computer cause malfunction data loss disk drive
The simplest remedy isolate computer vibration source either moving away vibrating equipment mounting base
Electronic computer component require relatively unvarying supply electrical power
Standard distribution voltage volt greater must stepped supply component usually transformer often called computer power supply output voltage used system bus typically volt
Further voltage reduction may required specific component
Voltage current transient An overvoltage overcurrent condition severe prolonged simply burn electronic component
Less severe transient may register spurious change state causing erratic program function corruption data
With low initial voltage computer simply fail function voltage insufficient raise electronic device threshold value
A severe voltage drop computer operation may trigger unplanned restart warm boot
The serious condition fluctuating low voltage may cause repeated partial restarts leaving memory data unpredictable state possibly hanging computer altogether
The effect complete power loss actually le drastic except content volatile RAM lost content file may become corrupt write operation progress power loss occurs
Interference Noise form radio frequency interference RFI electromagnetic interference EMI harder track correct
Radio frequency interference arises often length cable acting antenna mobile communication source plant lift truck radio
Electromagnetic interference come piece equipment generates electrical magnetic field commonly motor
Do neglect check possible temporary source interference arc welding notorious culprit
Note also computer component cable long communication line disk drive motor may generate interference
Normally however computer required meet government specification RFI EMI emission interfere operation electronic equipment
The effect electrical interference similar fast transient power line generation spurious signal computer mistake data
These may cause erratic operation extreme case total computer failure
Power failure If continued operation computer critically important uninterruptible power supply UPS may necessary addition incoming power line
During normal operation line power charge battery turn feed power supply computer
In case blackout power stored battery maintain computer operation limited time typically one several hour
If one need enough time copy content memory disk shut computer orderly fashion twenty minute half hour enough otherwise weigh cost importance process normal length power outage
The wattage rating UPS sufficient support memory display disk drive typically biggest power consumer
Static electricity A static discharge typically low current reach extremely high voltage damage computer equipment
Components memory chip integrated circuit board typically ship bag protect accidental discharge shipment
Once one installs component system computer grounding subsystem protects
During installation however vulnerable personnel take appropriate precaution wearing ground strap clothing using antistatic mat
Maintaining adequate humidity level help control static electricity
Heat Electronic component work within operating temperature range
Find range specification
Outside range characteristic change beyond design limit behavior becomes erratic life lessens
In extreme case fire hazard may arise
The usual method cooling computer component convection surrounding air often assisted fan draw air component
Other device monitor screen fan cool convection
For method work surrounding air substantially cooler component one reason computer room often air conditioned
Computers vent draw cooling air must remain clear even seem provide nice shelf manual drawing bag lunch

A also called loss particular area
There many cause power failure electricity network
Examples cause include fault damage part system overloading electricity main
Power failure particularly critical site environment public safety risk
Institutions plant shelter like usually backup power source automatically start electrical power lost
Other critical system also required emergency power
The telephone exchange usually array backup also socket connecting generator extended period outage
Power outage categorized three different phenomenon relating duration effect outage In power generation electrical load demand must close equal every second avoid overloading network component severely damage
used automatically detect overload disconnect circuit risk damage
Under certain condition network component shutting cause current fluctuation neighboring segment network leading larger section network
This may range building block entire city entire
Modern power system designed resistant sort cascading failure may unavoidable see
Moreover since economic benefit preventing rare failure researcher expressed concern tendency erode resilience network time corrected major failure occurs
In publication Carreras claimed reducing likelihood small outage increase likelihood larger one
In case economic benefit keeping individual customer happy increase likelihood blackout
Computer system electronic device containing logic circuitry susceptible data loss hardware damage caused sudden loss power
These include data networking equipment video projector alarm system well computer
To protect computer system use provide constant flow electricity primary power supply becomes unavailable short period time
To protect surge event voltage increase second damage hardware power restored special device called absorbs excess voltage used
Restoring power outage difficult power station need brought back
Normally done help power rest grid
In total absence grid power need performed power grid operation
The mean depend greatly local circumstance operational policy typically utility establish localized island progressively coupled together
To maintain supply frequency within tolerable limit process demand must reconnected pace generation restored requiring close coordination power station transmission distribution organization
It argued basis computer modeling
These system exhibit unavoidable disturbance size size entire system
This phenomenon attributed steadily increasing economics running power company limit modern engineering
While blackout frequency shown reduced operating critical point generally economically feasible causing provider increase average load time upgrade le often resulting grid moving closer critical point
Conversely system past critical point experience many blackout leading upgrade moving back critical point
The term critical point system used sense statistical physic nonlinear dynamic representing point system undergoes phase transition case transition steady reliable grid cascading failure sporadic unreliable grid common cascading failure
Near critical point relationship blackout frequency size follows distribution
Other leader dismissive system theory conclude blackout inevitable agree basic operation grid must changed
The champion use feature power control device employing coordinate grid
Others advocate greater use electronically controlled HVDC firebreak prevent disturbance cascading across AC line
becomes much common close critical point
The relationship seen historical data model system
The practice operating system much closer maximum capacity lead magnified effect random unavoidable disturbance due aging weather human interaction etc
While near critical point failure greater effect surrounding component due individual component carrying larger load
This result larger load failing component redistributed larger quantity across system making likely additional component directly affected disturbance fail igniting costly dangerous cascading failure
These initial disturbance causing blackout unexpected unavoidable due action power supplier prevent obvious disturbance cutting back tree separating line windy area replacing aging component etc
The complexity power grid often make initial cause blackout extremely hard identify
In researcher ORNL Power System Engineering Research Center PSerc proposed mathematical model behavior electrical distribution system
This model become known OPA model reference name author institution
OPA cascading failure model
Other cascading failure model include Manchester Hidden failure CASCADE Branching
The effect trying mitigate cascading failure near critical point economically feasible fashion often shown beneficial often even detrimental
Four mitigation method tested using blackout model In addition finding mitigation strategy relationship regard frequency small large blackout total number blackout event significantly reduced mitigation measure
A complex model control large blackout proposed Motter
One proposed solution proposed reduce impact power outage introduced Saleh
Utilities measured three specific performance measure

On searing Thursday afternoon September technician reconfiguring circuit electrical switchyard near Yuma prematurely cranked open switch
This tiny misstep shorted Southwest Powerlink major electrical artery region key part entire Western grid sparked one biggest blackout ever strike North America
As electricity sought new path across network line overloaded snapping equipment offline
Power plant transformer power line across western Arizona Southern California Mexico Baja California automatically shut protect
The climax came five line supplying San Diego simultaneously shut sealing region electrical fate
Power instantly zapped million people
For hour swath Southwest powerless
Commerce shut electronic transaction cash register failed
Without signal light guide traffic street jammed
Food spoiled
Millions gallon raw sewage escaped tainting coastal estuary beach
Hospitals call center first responder struggled meet demand relying limited backup power
In theory spontaneous blackout never happen
According cardinal rule designing operating power grid system always enough spare capacity sustain loss single element even one big Southwest Powerlink
Grid operator create computer simulation grid systematically rerun model taking element turn confirm flow stable
Operating grid way electrical equivalent driving spare tire trunk
Yet big blackout keep happening
They tough problem crack power grid often described world largest machine massively complex system
Big blackout usually result multiple component acting
After human error kicked Southwest blackout myriad element system behave according grid operator model
Transformers California Imperial Valley overloaded faster expected automated scheme shut five line running south San Diego even though none line imminent risk overheating
After year trying get around computational barrier Dobson pair physicist Ben Carreras David Newman found solution
Drawing insight behavior complex system trio created novel simulator mimic largest blackout power grid likely experience
Experts say time lose bringing tool online
The trio insight suggest grid vulnerable bigger blackout seen
And potential trigger multiplying wilder weather climate change rising concern terrorism fluctuating power renewable energy source heap new challenge aging grid
The industry need tool need provide soon possible say Yuri Makarov blackout researcher Department Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Dobson Carreras Newman need sell power industry heeding warning
The trio hunt cause big blackout grew two physicist research fusion energy Department Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee
Newman teen developed fascination turbulence rafting guide Colorado arrived Oak Ridge explore different kind turbulence plasma fusing hydrogen atom inside experimental fusion reactor
The earnest freshly minted teamed plasma physicist Carreras Spaniard one lab distinguished scientist
Newman Carreras made odd couple effective one
They set understand unexpected instability arose scientist sparked tried contain nuclear fusion process fuel star
They produced mathematical model showing turbulence fusion plasma contrary prevailing wisdom bear little resemblance snarling river Newman youth
By scientist identified similar pattern growth collapse diverse natural system forest fire earthquake
Newman Carreras discovered theory explains plasma lasted longer second fusion reactor test date
The work earned Newman Presidential Early Career Award highest federal honor bestowed upon young scientist
In Newman saw news report blackout wondered point criticality theory might also apply major power outage whether could help prevent
Carreras eager new problem solve suggested bring grid expert
They found one Dobson earned reputation innovative power system engineer using advanced math unmask unsuspected relationship voltage drop blackout
The trio first looked historical record big blackout see could detect criticality distinctive imprint
They mined database blackout North America plotted size
If big blackout random unlucky confluence many small failure grid planner operator believed major grid collapse would occur thousand year showing slim tail bell curve
Instead plot bulged right showing blackout striking hundred time often
For trio strong suggestion blackout indeed power grid equivalent sand pile avalanche
It physical law say Carreras
In January Carreras Dobson Newman reported overabundance big blackout Hawaii International Conference System Sciences HICSS one biggest annual gathering system scientist
They speculated blackout risk might spike power flow grid exceeded threshold familiar critical point system theory
But pushing grid point criticality
They knew power consumption rising financial pressure limited construction new line
Could influence combine put extra strain grid transmission line enough reach tipping point
To test theory trio realized rethink power grid simulation
Existing simulator could handle direct modeling big blackout complexity power grid
But could create simpler simulator could set motion observed power level increased time like Bak growing sand pile
But worked
The telltale pattern large blackout
On artificial grid archive blackout looked like growing sand pile fusion reactor complex system
As expected big blackout spiked simulated electricity flow exceeded critical threshold
In January trio back HICSS presenting simulation
The grid simulation cast entirely different light big blackout posed provocative new question grid design operation
The disturbing implication came University Vermont grid researcher Paul Hines
Following trio logic concluded blackout bigger seen probably future
Using statistical tool urban planner insurance company use predict disaster earthquake flood based prior pattern Hines forecast blackout would knock megawatt power
That time bigger Southwest blackout twice size North America biggest power failure August Northeast blackout left million people without power
The trio fleshed equally disturbing lesson blackout prevention The conventional practice preventing blackout involve trying thwart even smallest failure may actually increase likelihood big one
After tweaking simulator setting reduce possibility random line failure artificial grid experienced big blackout
Protecting grid small blackout enables run higher higher power level ultimately setting grid major collapse
The Northeast blackout struck prime moment trio thrusting theory medium spotlight
Major newspaper news broadcast turned help explaining grid might spontaneously collapsed
An article journal Nature captured message succinctly Power grid inherently prone big blackout



Trying make robust make problem The idea preventing failure might unwittingly hasten big blackout proved wildly unpopular power company engineer struggled reassure nervous public amid crisis confidence grid
Carreras belief controversy put trio research jeopardy say fall director Oak Ridge National Laboratory told official Washington fuming trio message
Carreras suspect research funding Department Energy dried soon afterward
We got cut say
They found new grant struggle
Electrical engineer reviewing grid research proposal questioned trio power model took dim view interdisciplinary effort
One common refrain grant review recall Newman What could physicist especially one podunk school know power grid What ultimately brought three cold year later accelerating energy revolution California
In state mandated utility use increasing amount electricity renewable source wind solar
Utility executive state energy expert feared cleaner le predictable energy source would heighten risk blackout keep power flowing willing test idea including trio
Merwin Brown whose grid research development program California Institute Energy Environment financed trio work describes research equivalent Hail Mary pas
It kept said really analyze cascading outage huge calculation say Brown
My team felt research program effort
We said Let test In Brown enlisted Dobson help craft project
The resulting million Extreme Events initiative would test trio approach advanced power grid simulator available operated scientist Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL predict often big blackout struck
For first time chance apply simulator real power grid mighty Western Interconnection one nation three main grid stretch Mexico British Columbia east Rockies
Blackouts striking California could start anywhere Western Interconnection propagate across without political obstacle
Nevertheless project moved forward two separate effort trio result reported March vindicated approach
The pattern blackout simulator produced closely matched Western grid record outage
In contrast counterpart powerful simulator underpredicted big blackout factor according calculation Dobson one student
The PNNL team present comparative analysis blackout frequency
The simulation also validated link power level risk The probability biggest blackout rose sharply simulated power flow exceeded critical point roughly percent grid capacity limit
More validation came later year Southwest blackout struck Western grid
In Extreme Events final report trio predicted vulnerable region within Western Interconnection eight area large blackout repeatedly struck simulation
One eight vulnerable grid segment identified quintet line north San Diego whose shutdown would seal region fate
It pretty amazing say Newman
The actual blackout September
Our prediction Validation California helped trio approach blackout earn respect power engineering community
Their idea inspired researcher use simulation seek telltale overabundance big blackout power grid Scandinavia New Zealand China
But changing grid operation based trio basic takeaway big blackout predictable running power grid cooler would exponentially reduce incidence begun
Most power system analysis continues use simulator predict biggest blackout
But power system operator talk openly day link power level risk
Whitley New York Independent System Operator CEO told attendee HICSS meeting new procedure New York system operator developed reduce risk power consumption running especially high
Under thunderstorm alert extra facility turned reduce power flowing long distance state transmission line
Whitley said extra cost justified given far higher cost blackout would impose If run gas turbine couple hour care told assembled system scientist
Power system adopting smart grid technology advanced power sensor automated switch could unintended impact reliability Papic note
For example advanced sensor providing unprecedented information power flow grid operator using monitor system stability
Whitley team using stability warning sensor guide use thunderstorm alert
But intelligence could also entice grid operator allow power flow existing power line
You getting closer limit overload propagate quickly generate problem Papic say
Without careful study smarter grid could actually become le safe grid
Perhaps inevitable based trio research insight get short shrift another catastrophic blackout
If right wait long The next big one always around corner

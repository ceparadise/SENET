An also called graphical representation entity relationship typically used computing regard organization within information system
An entity piece concept data stored
A relationship data shared entity
There three type relationship entity One instance entity A associated one instance another entity B
For example database employee employee name A associated one social security number B
One instance entity A associated zero one many instance another entity B one instance entity B one instance entity A
For example company employee working one building building name A associated many different employee B employee share singular association entity A
One instance entity A associated one zero many instance another entity B one instance entity B associated one zero many instance entity A
For example company employee work multiple project instance employee A associated many instance project B time instance project B multiple employee A associated

An describes thing interest specific domain knowledge
An ER model composed entity type classify thing interest specifies relationship exist instance entity type
In ER model commonly formed represent thing business need remember order perform business process
Consequently ER model becomes abstract defines data information structure implemented typically
modeling developed database design published paper
However variant idea existed previously
Some ER modeler show super subtype entity connected relationship ER model used also specification
An model usually result systematic analysis define describe important process area business
It define business process present business data schema graphical form
It usually drawn graphical form box connected line express association dependency entity
An ER model also expressed verbal form example Entities may characterized relationship also additional property include identifier called primary key
Diagrams created represent attribute well entity relationship may called diagram rather model
An ER model typically implemented
In simple relational database implementation row table represents one instance entity type field table represents attribute type
In relationship entity implemented storing primary key one entity pointer foreign key table another entity There tradition model built two three level abstraction
Note hierarchy used kind specification different
The first stage design us model describe information need type stored
The technique used describe
overview classification used term relationship certain
In case design information system based database later stage usually called logical design mapped turn mapped physical model physical design
Note sometimes phase referred physical design
An may defined thing capable independent existence uniquely identified
An entity abstraction complexity domain
When speak entity normally speak aspect real world distinguished aspect real world
An entity thing exists either physically logically
An entity may physical object house car exist physically event house sale car service concept customer transaction order exist concept
Although term entity one commonly used following Chen really distinguish entity
An category
An entity strictly speaking instance given
There usually many instance
Because term somewhat cumbersome people tend use term entity synonym term
Entities thought
Examples computer employee song mathematical theorem
A relationship capture entity related one another
Relationships thought linking two noun
Examples relationship company computer relationship employee department relationship artist song relationship mathematician conjecture
The model linguistic aspect described utilized database ERROL mimic construct
ERROL implementation based RRA relational algebra adapted model capture linguistic aspect
Entities relationship attribute
Examples entity might SSN attribute relationship may attribute
Every entity unless must minimal set uniquely identifying attribute called entity
diagram show single entity single instance relation
Rather show entity set entity entity type relationship set relationship relationship type
Example particular entity
The collection song database entity set
The relationship child lunch single relationship
The set relationship database relationship set
In word relationship set corresponds relationship corresponds member relation
Certain relationship set may indicated well
Chen proposed following rule thumb mapping natural language description ER diagram Peter Chen
Physical view show data actually stored
In Chen original paper give example relationship role
He describes relationship marriage two role husband wife
A person play role husband marriage relationship another person play role wife marriage
These word noun
That surprise naming thing requires noun
Chen terminology also applied earlier idea
The line arrow diagram owes earlier Chen relationship diagram
Another common extension Chen model name relationship role verb phrase
It also become prevalent name role phrase
Correct noun case
Thus rather etc
The use noun direct benefit generating physical implementation semantic model
When two relationship possible generate name immediately meaningful
Modifications original specification beneficial
Chen described
As aside notation used Oracle Designer us minimum cardinality analogous optionality role maximum cardinality crow foot
In Elmasri Navathe others preference role minimum maximum cardinality
Recent researcher Feinerer Dullea et al
shown coherent applied relationship order greater
In Dullea et al
one read A across notation used UML effectively represent semantics participation constraint imposed relationship degree higher binary
In Feinerer say Problems arise operate semantics used UML association
Hartmann investigates situation show different transformation fail
also As see next page interpretation introduces several difficulty prevent extension simple mechanism binary association
Chen notation modeling us rectangle represent entity set diamond represent relationship appropriate attribute relationship
If entity set participates relationship set connected line
Attributes drawn oval connected line exactly one entity relationship set
Cardinality constraint expressed follows Attributes often omitted clutter diagram diagram technique often list entity attribute within rectangle drawn entity set
Related diagramming convention technique Crow foot notation beginning date back article Gordon Everest used SSADM
Crow foot diagram represent entity box relationship line box
Different shape end line represent cardinality relationship
Crow foot notation used consultancy practice
Many consultant CACI including Richard Barker subsequently moved UK developed early version Oracle tool introducing notation wider audience
With notation relationship attribute
Where necessary relationship promoted entity right example necessary capture artist performed song new entity performance introduced attribute reflecting time place relationship artist song becomes indirect relationship via performance
In using modeled database user encounter two well known issue returned result mean something result assumed query author
The first trap
It occurs master table linking multiple table relationship
The issue derives name way model look draw diagram linked table master table
This type model look similar type model used
When trying calculate sum aggregate using standard SQL master table get unexpected incorrect result explanation missing
The solution either adjust model SQL
This issue occurs mostly database decision support system software query system sometimes includes specific method handling issue
The second issue trap
A chasm trap occurs model suggests existence relationship entity type pathway exist certain entity occurrence
For example Building Rooms hold Computers
You would expect able query model see Computers Building
However Computers currently assigned Room repair somewhere else shown list
You need another relation Building Computers capture computer building
This last modelling issue result failure capture relationship exist real world model
See detail
A semantic model model concept sometimes called platform independent model
It intensional model
At latest since well known An extensional model one map element particular methodology technology thus platform specific model
The UML specification explicitly state association class model extensional fact considering extensive array additional adornment provided specification provided prior candidate semantic modelling language
Peter Chen father ER modeling said seminal paper In original article Chen explicitly contrast diagram record modelling technique Several author also support Chen program Chen accord philosophic theoretical tradition time Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates Plato Aristotle BC modern
associate knowledge apprehension unchanging Forms The form according Socrates roughly speaking archetype abstract representation many type thing property relationship one another

Conceptual Data Modeling Jim Watanabe manager No Customer Escapes project assistant director IT Petrie Electronics sitting company cafeteria
He finished house salad go back office Stephanie Welch sat table
Jim met Stephanie back started work Petrie
He remembered worked database administrator
Hi Jim remember asked
Sure Stephanie
How thing database land Can complain
Sanjay asked talk database need new customer loyalty Stephanie phone binged
She pulled oversize bag looked
She started text continued talk Jim
How far along database requirement That kinda rude Jim thought
Oh well
We still early stage
I send preliminary diagram PE Figure along description major OK help
I suspect many new entity add already system Stephanie responded still looking phone still texting
She briefly looked Jim smiled slightly going back texting
Just send I let know I She stood still looking phone
Got ta go said walked away
OK Jim thought I need remember send Stephanie preliminary
I probably send entity description PE Table case
Jim stood carried tray recycling area cafeteria went back office
When Jim got back office Sanjay waiting
I got information alternative talked earlier Sanjay said
I one employee gather data alternative might satisfy See description alternative PE Table
Sanjay handed Jim short report
The matrix show requirement constraint alternative make relatively easy compare See PE Figure
Coupon A coupon special promotion created specifically individual customer
A coupon set dollar amount example
The customer may use like cash like promotion purchasing product service
Coupons created individual customer based point customer loyalty account
For dollar value coupon certain number point must redeemed
Coupons must accounted created redeemed
Customer A customer someone buy product service Petrie Electronics
Customers include online customer shop Petrie store
Product An item made available sale Petrie customer
For example product Sony LCD HD television
Products purchased online store
Promotion A promotion special incentive provided customer entice customer buying specific product service
For example promotion intended sell disk may involve coupon
Promotions targeted customer subset customer individual customer
Service A job performed one Petrie associate customer
For example upgrading memory computer installing new memory card service Petrie provides fee
Services may ordered performed store online
Transaction A record particular product service sold specified customer particular date
A transaction may involve one product service may involve one particular kind product service
For example one transaction may involve blank DVDs prerecorded DVDs prerecorded DVDs may movie
For member loyalty program transaction worth number point depending dollar value transaction
The matrix favor XRA CRM system Jim said looking report
It look like proposal meet requirement best Nova group proposal best job Yes barely Sanjay said
There difference XRA Nova pretty comparable come constraint
But I think XRA system pretty clear advantage meeting XRA seems pretty highly rated matrix term requirement
You ranked better two proposal implementation scalability vendor support Jim said
The gave proven performance one whole That one best company industry work Sanjay responded Their reputation This look really promising Jim said
Let see reality match
It time put together formal request proposal
I get work started today
I hope Data system designed licensed Standard Basic Systems SBSI
The data warehousing tool heart system designed developed SBSI work standard relational DBMSs hybrid DBMSs
The SBSI tool approach used many year well known industry certified staff essential implementation operation maintenance
The license relatively expensive

The vendor truly innovative small inexperienced
The customer interface designed standard Web browser stunning design extremely easy customer use check loyalty program status
The software run remotely cloud data related customer loyalty program would stored cloud
Review diagram developed question Petrie Electronics case end Chapter diagram given instructor
Study data flow data stored diagram decide whether agree team conclusion six entity type needed listed case PE Figure
If disagree define additional entity type explain necessary modify PE Figure accordingly

Again review DFDs developed Petrie Electronics case given instructor
Use DFDs identify attribute six entity listed case plus additional entity identified answer Question
Write unambiguous definition attribute
Then redraw PE Figure placing six additional entity case diagram along associated attribute

Using answer Question designate attribute attribute form identifier entity type
Explain chose identifier

Using answer Question draw relationship entity type needed system
Remember relationship needed system want data associated entity instance
Give meaningful name relationship
Specify cardinality relationship explain decided minimum maximum cardinality end relationship
State assumption made Petrie Electronics case read far answer question case provide evidence justify cardinality choose
Redraw final diagram Microsoft Visio

Now developed answer Question complete diagram Petrie Electronics database consequence employee entity type diagram
Assuming attribute show diagram would attribute moved entity currently associated employee entity type diagram
Why

What attribute identify entity type answer Question
Why needed
Can make observation date attribute must kept database based analysis database

An diagram specialized graphic form illustrates
ER diagram often use symbol represent three type information entity concept relationship attribute
In industry standard ER diagram box used represent entity
Diamonds used represent relationship oval used represent attribute
Although untrained eye diagram look incredibly complicated knowledgeable viewer help business user understand structure high level without accompanying detail
Database designer use ER diagram modeling relationship database entity clear format
Many software package automated method generate ER diagram existing database
Consider example database contains information resident city
The ER diagram shown image accompanying article contains two entity Person City
A single Lives In relationship tie two together
Each person life one city city house many people
In example diagram attribute person name city population
In general noun used describe entity attribute verb used describe relationship
Each item track database entity entity table relational database
Usually entity database corresponds row
If database containing name people entity might called Person
A table name would exist database every person would assigned row Person table
Databases contain information entity
This information termed attribute
consists information unique entity listed
In Person example attribute could include first name last name birthdate identifying number
Attributes provide detailed information entity
In relational database attribute held field information inside record held
You limited specific number attribute
The value diagram lie ability display information relationship entity
In example track information city person life
You could also track information city City entity relationship tie together People City information
When finished clearly illustrated different business concept relate conceptual foundation design relational database support business

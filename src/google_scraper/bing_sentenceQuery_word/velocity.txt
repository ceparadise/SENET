Velocity expression object particle undergoes respect
The standard unit velocity magnitude also known
Alternatively centimeter per second used express velocity magnitude
The direction velocity vector expressed various way depending number dimension involved
Velocity relative
Consider car moving respect surface highway traveling northward
If driving car velocity car relative body zero
If stand side road velocity car relative northward
If driving car respect road traveling northward another car moving respect road pass direction car velocity relative northward
But car pass going opposite way road velocity relative southward
Circular motion illustrates fundamental difference speed velocity
Think whirling ball tied string around body ball tangential speed
Even though ball speed constant relative body velocity relative body constantly change direction vector describes circle
Velocity expressed either average period time instantaneous value single moment time
Suppose car moving relative road surface hit accelerator increase velocity uniformly zero northward second
Your average velocity time frame northward
However instantaneous velocity depends time might anything zero northward depending exact moment measured

John taught college science course online since doctorate physiology
Did know speed velocity different
Most people consider speed velocity may even use term interchangeably
While speed velocity similar definitely
So different
matter fast object moving regardless direction going whereas matter fast object get somewhere respect direction
Think person repeatedly taking two step forward two step back
They moving getting anywhere
In word speed velocity
In short measure fast object move measure fast object get somewhere
Before discus formula calculating speed velocity need consider detailed definition term
defined rate change distance respect time
defined rate change displacement respect time
Notice word difference two definition
So difference distance displacement
refers total amount ground covered object motion whereas refers net change position object motion
Distance call distance fully described magnitude alone reference direction
Since speed function distance speed scalar quantity well
Displacement displacement fully described magnitude direction
Since velocity function displacement velocity vector quantity
If combine definition speed velocity one could say speed direction would accurate
Now understand concept speed velocity examine formula calculating measure
Let take look speed first
As discussed rate change distance period time
In word speed function distance time
As formula calculating speed includes distance time speed directly proportional change distance inversely proportional change time
Let take look formula speed Let use example practice calculating speed
Consider man walking zigzag pattern
If man cover total meter zigzag change distance equal meter
Now let say take second cover zigzag pattern
Therefore change time second
We put value together formula calculate speed
Let first recall formula speed Now plug observed value divided equal
Therefore man moving speed meter per second
This expressed meter sec second
You may familiar speed expressed mile per hour simply
Let take look formula velocity
As discussed measure change displacement time distance
In word velocity measure long take object reach destination direction
Velocity directly proportional displacement inversely proportional time traveled
Let take look velocity formula Get FREE access day create account
Let consider man traveling zigzag pattern
We determined speed meter per second
We know speed velocity
In order calculate velocity must first determine displacement
To determine displacement measure distance straight line man starting point destination
Now let say measure displacement meter right
Now calculate velocity
Let first recall formula velocity Plug measured value displacement time get velocity meter right second
Now divided
Therefore man velocity meter per second right
Once velocity vector quantity expressing magnitude direction
Here magnitude direction right
To summarize speed velocity similar different
measure distance traveled time refers much ground covered object motion
measure displacement time refers net change position object motion
Distance speed fully described magnitude reference direction
Displacement velocity hand fully described magnitude direction
thought speed direction
The formula speed change distance divided change time
The formula velocity change displacement divided change time

The object respect function time
Velocity equivalent specification direction
north
Velocity important concept branch describes motion body
Velocity physical magnitude direction needed define
The velocity called speed coherent derived unit whose quantity measured SI base unit
For example metre per second scalar whereas metre per second east vector
If change speed direction object changing velocity said undergoing
To object must constant speed constant direction
Constant direction constrains object motion straight path thus constant velocity mean motion straight line constant speed
For example car moving constant kilometre per hour circular path constant speed constant velocity direction change
Hence car considered undergoing acceleration
describes fast object moving whereas velocity give fast direction object moving
If car said travel speed specified
However car said move north velocity specified
The big difference noticed consider movement around circle
When something move circular path constant speed see return starting point average velocity zero average found dividing time taken move around
This average velocity calculated considering starting end point average speed considers total traveled
Velocity defined rate change position respect time may also referred emphasize distinction average velocity
In application average velocity object might needed say constant velocity would provide resultant displacement variable velocity time interval time period
Average velocity calculated The average velocity always le equal average speed object
This seen realizing distance always strictly increasing displacement increase decrease magnitude well change direction
In term graph instantaneous velocity simply velocity thought average velocity slope two point coordinate equal boundary time period average velocity
The average velocity velocity averaged time say average may calculated time integral velocity may identify If consider velocity displacement change position vector express instantaneous velocity particle object particular time position respect time From derivative equation case seen area velocity time graph displacement
In calculus term velocity function displacement function
In figure corresponds yellow area curve labeled alternative notation displacement
Since derivative position respect time give change position divided change time velocity measured
Although concept instantaneous velocity might first seem may thought velocity object would continue travel stopped accelerating moment
Although velocity defined rate change position often common start expression object
As seen three green tangent line figure object instantaneous acceleration point time curve graph point
In word acceleration defined derivative velocity respect time From obtain expression velocity area acceleration time graph
As done using concept integral In special case constant acceleration velocity studied using
By considering equal arbitrary constant vector trivial show velocity time velocity time
By combining equation suvat equation possible relate displacement average velocity It also possible derive expression velocity independent time known follows etc
The equation valid
Where Newtonian mechanic special relativity differ different observer would describe situation
In particular Newtonian mechanic observer agree value transformation rule position create situation observer would describe acceleration object value
Neither true special relativity
In word relative velocity calculated
The moving object dependent velocity given equation ignoring kinetic energy mass
Kinetic energy scalar quantity depends square velocity however related quantity vector defined In dimensionless appears frequently given γ Lorentz factor speed light
minimum speed ballistic object need escape massive body Earth
It represents kinetic energy added object gravitational potential energy always negative equal zero
The general formula escape velocity object distance center planet mass
The escape velocity Earth surface irrespective direction object
This make escape velocity somewhat misnomer correct term would escape speed object attaining velocity magnitude irrespective atmosphere leave vicinity base body long intersect something path
measurement velocity two object determined single coordinate system
Relative velocity fundamental classical modern physic since many system physic deal relative motion two particle
In Newtonian mechanic relative velocity independent chosen inertial reference frame
This case anymore velocity depend choice reference frame
If object A moving velocity object B velocity vector velocity object A object B defined difference two velocity vector Similarly relative velocity object B moving velocity relative object A moving velocity Usually inertial frame chosen latter two mentioned object rest
In case velocity scalar equation either In velocity described defined component velocity away toward origin also known rate rotation origin positive quantity representing rotation negative quantity representing clockwise rotation coordinate system

In defined computer program whose value monotonically decreased respect strict iteration thereby
A loop variant whose range restricted integer also known case provides trivial upper bound number iteration loop terminates
However loop variant may thus necessarily restricted integer value
A relation characterized existence minimal element every subset domain
The existence variant prof termination computer program
A basic property relation
Therefore loop possessing variant terminate finite number iteration long body terminates time
A generally computer program may contain loop said terminates
In order formally state rule inference termination loop demonstrated recall rule expressing partial correctness loop loop
To express total correctness write instead addition convention unbound symbol taken
The existence variant implies loop terminates
It may seem surprising converse true well long assume every loop terminates given invariant variant
To prove assume loop terminates given invariant total correctness assertion Consider successor relation state space induced execution statement state satisfying invariant condition
That say state successor We note otherwise loop would fail terminate
Next consider reflexive transitive closure successor relation
Call say state either finite chain successor We note two distinct state iterate iterate otherwise loop would fail terminate
In word iteration antisymmetric thus
Now since loop terminates finite number step given invariant state successor unless true state conclude every state finitely many iterates every descending chain respect iteration finitely many distinct value thus
loop iteration satisfies
successor relation originally defined loop state space since strict irreflexive contained iterate relation
Thus identity function state space variant loop shown state must strictly successor iterate time body executed given invariant condition
Moreover show counting argument existence variant implies existence variant This collection state reachable finite computer program finite number step finite input countably infinite enumeration countable set
In practice loop variant often taken even required requirement every loop integer variant remove expressive power programming language
Unless formally verified language allows transfinite proof termination equally powerful construct longer capable full
canonical example recursive function computed
In term however function primitive recursive lie far beyond realm usually considered
Considering even simple case exponentiation primitive recursive function composition primitive recursive function primitive recursive one begin see quickly primitive recursive function grow
And function computed running time bounded primitive recursive function primitive recursive
So difficult imagine practical use full primitive recursion especially since former simulated latter exceedingly long running time
And case first imply loop always terminate proven thus unavoidable requirement formal proof termination must reduce expressive power programming language
While shown every loop terminates variant mean loop iteration proven
Here example integer variant computed upper bound number iteration remaining loop
However allows side effect evaluation expression unacceptable point view formally verifying computer program
Why even consider transfinite variant
This question raised practical instance want prove program terminates also want prove terminates reasonable amount time
There least two possibility

In condition relied upon true execution program portion
It held always true certain phase execution
For example condition true beginning end every execution loop
Invariants especially useful reasoning whether computer program correct
The theory methodology determining rely heavily invariant
Programmers often use code make invariant explicit
Some special syntax specifying
The good example logical problem determining invariant useful
The puzzle asks one start word MI transform word MU using step one following transformation rule An example derivation superscript indicating applied rule Is possible convert MI MU using four transformation rule
One could spend many hour applying transformation rule string
However might quicker find invariant rule
changed demonstrates getting MU impossible
Logically looking puzzle way get rid I three consecutive I string
This make following invariant interesting consider This invariant problem transformation rule following hold invariant held applying rule also hold applying
If look net effect applying rule number I U see actually case rule The table show clearly invariant hold possible transformation rule basically mean whichever rule pick whatever state number I multiple three applying rule wo afterwards either
Given single I starting string MI one multiple three impossible go MI MU zero multiple three
tool compute simple invariant given imperative computer program
The kind property found depend used
Typical example property single integer variable range like relation several variable like modulus information like
Academic research prototype also consider simple property pointer structure
Any sophisticated invariant still provided manually
In particular verifying imperative program using Hoare calculus loop invariant provided manually loop program one reason task extremely tedious
In example tool able detect rule derivation MI MU impossible
However abstraction string number I made hand leading
following C program abstract interpretation tool able detect ca hence never terminate

Whenever start program selection screen defined system display set input field selection
To select certain set data enter appropriate range value
If often run program set selection example create monthly statistical report save value selection set called
You also use variant change appearance selection screen hiding selection criterion
This particularly useful working large selection screen field relevant
Reports module pool function group may several selection screen
It therefore possible create variant one selection screen
Variants interface user selection screen
They used dialog background mode although us slightly different
In dialog mode variant make thing easier user since save continually enter identical value
They also make selection screen easier read use hide input field
Running executable program variant containing optimal set value also reduces capacity user error
The optimized database selection speed runtime program
Variants method passing value report program background job
Therefore run program background must use variant SUBMIT
VIA JOB
To avoid create new variant time run report ABAP contains mechanism allowing pas variable value variant
See
To ensure executable program always started using variant specify program attribute program may started way

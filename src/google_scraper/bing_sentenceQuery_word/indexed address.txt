Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I studying exam called Computer Fundamental started taking previous exam given document way inadequate solve question mentioned like one Which following correct combination variousaddressing mode
Here address stored program counter
address part instruction addressed address operand needed execute instruction stored
value index register
mean content location
I tried google Addressing mode came resource ca understand
Can someone recommend link get know addressing mode answer question
Thanks alot
I sorry tag ca find thing like address addressing mode I recommend start understanding direct addressing indirect addressing addressing indexed addressing mean
With luck textbook explain
If able find many explanation Internet
At last resort check manual favorite processor
The correct answer b
direct addressing mode effective address equal address part instruction
indirect addressing mode effective address equal content address part instruction
relative addressing mode effective address equal sum address part instruction content program counter
indexed addressing mode effective address equal sum address part instruction content index register
If wan na read addressing mode refer By posting answer agree

In Effective address address content specified index register Note le addressing mode except offset case large enough address memory location
I still understand difference offset index
And difference addressing mode Indexed absolute addressing mode
Thanks
Offset absolute number byte
So address offset effective address
Index offset multiplied constant
So address index size element address
You would use indexing array value
To example sound like LEA instruction With said I read Wikipedia article I ca see difference Indexed absolute Base plus index Scaled
It look like exact thing except term address base interchanged
This look like many author writing thing
If response get enough upvotes I editing article

When instruction LOAD fed I understand value loaded accumulator I know get result indexed indirect addressing
Not sure architecture discussing I explain generically best I based experience wtih concrete architecture investigative analysis stuff shown graphic posted
Immediate mode mean use immediate value something like would put immediate value register
Direct mean direct memory access something like load memory address value
Indirect mean indirect memory access something like load memory address
The memory address value
This one combination like
What would would add register immediate value get grab value memory location giving

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

In simply specifying allows code repeatedly
The syntax based heritage language prior programming language borrowed programming language descendant offshoot language originally provided iterator often use keyword name iterator descendant use descendant use
There possibility example us PERFORM VARYING
Unlike many kind often distinguished explicit loop variable
This allows body code repeatedly executed know sequencing iteration
also typically used number iteration known entering loop
shorthand way make loop number iteration known every could written
The name come English word used programming language introduce
The term English date popularized influential later direct translation earlier German used also involved defining ALGOL ALGOL
The loop body executed given value loop variable though explicit version statement list possible value increment specified
In though keyword used called otherwise identical described confused
A statement available language
Even ignoring minor difference many difference statement work level expressiveness support
Generally fall one following category The language like requires look something like Depending language explicit sign may used place language require word even numerical case
An optional increment decrement may also included although exact syntax used differs bit language
Some language require separate declaration control variable
Another form popularized
It requires part three part optional
The initialization declares perhaps assigns variable required
The type variable using multiple variable initialization part
The condition check condition quits loop false
The afterthought performed exactly every time loop end repeat
Here example traditional
This type generalisation numeric range type allows enumeration set item number sequence
It usually characterized use implicit explicit loop variable take value sequence data collection
A representative example Where either data collection support implicit iteration like list employee name may fact iterator
Some language addition another syntax notably PHP type loop name well see name
Some language offer act processing iteration keyword interpretation expression evaluated assignment made distinct explicit iteration form
For example statement following pseudocode fragment calculating new value except first reference obtain new value placed previous step
In version however calculation refers original unaltered
The difference may significant
Some language FORTRAN also offer array assignment statement enable many omitted
Thus pseudocode would set element array A zero matter size dimensionality
The example loop could rendered But whether would rendered style something else may clearly described compiler manual
Introduced followed allows iteration loop compounded test That value assigned loop variable loop body executed
If result execution stop short
Granted loop variable value defined termination loop statement find first element array value suitable variation first character string
In control iteration loop computer construct
It named us construct result variable taking range integer value orderly sequence starting end increment Loop counter change loop providing unique value individual iteration
The loop counter used decide loop terminate program flow continue next loop
A common loop counter use variable name needed would outer loop next inner loop etc
The reverse order also used programmer
This style generally agreed originated early programming variable name beginning letter implicitly declared integer type obvious choice loop counter temporarily required
The practice date back often etc
A variant convention use reduplicated letter index allows easier searching using single letter
An example code involving nested loop loop counter variable This commonly source since fundamental step iteration completely control programmer
In fact infinite loop intended type used empty expression This style used instead infinite loop avoid type conversion warning compiler
Some programmer prefer succinct form semantically equivalent verbose form
Some language may also provide supporting statement present alter iteration proceeds
Common among statement found C derivative
The break statement cause loop terminated immediately executed
The continue statement move next iteration without progress loop body current iteration
A statement also terminates break goto return statement within statement body executed
Wells Other language may similar statement otherwise provide mean alter progress example FORTRAN Some language offer facility naming various loop statement multiple nested loop doubt loop involved
Fortran example Thus trouble detected inner loop CYCLE mean skip next iteration I J
The compiler also checking END DO appropriate label position documentation aid
The programmer must still code problem correctly possible blunder blocked
Different language specify different rule value loop variable hold termination loop indeed hold becomes undefined
This permit generate code leaf value loop variable perhaps even leaf unchanged loop value held register never stored memory
Actual behaviour may even vary according compiler optimization setting Honywell compiler
In language loop variable within scope loop body attempt modify value regarded semantic error
Such modification sometimes consequence programmer error difficult identify made
However overt change likely detected compiler
Situations address loop variable passed argument make difficult check routine behavior general unknowable compiler
Some example style Fortran A common approach calculate iteration count start loop careful attention overflow integer arithmetic iteration decrement count also adjusting value double counting result
However adjustment value within loop change number iteration executed
Still another possibility code generated may employ auxiliary variable loop variable possibly held machine register whose value may may copied iteration
Again modification would affect control loop disjunction possible within loop reference value might possibly altered current value auxiliary variable held safe improper modification confusing result guaranteed
For instance within loop reference element array would likely employ auxiliary variable especially held machine register parameter routine instance reveal value would likely reference proper variable instead
It best avoid possibility
Just index variable might modified within also may bound direction
But uncertain effect
A compiler may prevent attempt may effect might even work properly though many would declare would wrong
Consider statement If approach compiling loop evaluation calculation iteration count via something like start item simple variable value somehow adjusted iteration would effect iteration count even element selected division changed
Algol allows loop loop variable iterated list range value instead single range
The following example execute loop six value A converted equivalent incrementing counter variable directly
The following illustrates technique easily translated following This translation slightly complicated language allow statement jump next iteration loop continue statement C
These statement typically implicitly increment counter equivalent since latter case counter integral part loop construct
Any translation place statement within block increment explicit counter running statement
The formal equivalence applies far computer arithmetic also follows axia mathematics particular x x
Actual computer arithmetic suffers overflow limited representation example unsigned arithmetic come zero represented unsigned
Similar problem arise size signed unsigned
Compiler writer handle like possibly producing code inspects state overflow indicator unless provision equivalent checking calculating equivalence fail counter never exceed loop never end unless mishap occurs
Given action must repeated instance five time different language written differently
The syntax nearly identical language accounting different style block termination
Fortran equivalent loop loop using keyword instead The syntax Fortran loop The following two example behave equivalently three argument language initializing counter variable incrementing iteration loop stopping five inclusive
In Fortran later may also written The step part may omitted step one
Example Spaces irrelevant Fortran statement thus
In modern Fortran style blank significant
In Fortran may avoided using statement
first formalised report
COBOL formalized late many elaboration
It us PERFORM verb many option later addition structured statement
Ignoring need declaring initialising variable equivalent would If PERFORM verb optional clause TEST AFTER resulting loop slightly different loop body executed least test
Loops sometimes called loop
Notice marker specifies name index variable must correspond name index variable start
Some language FORTRAN later allow statement label start matched compiler text corresponding statement
Fortran also allows EXIT CYCLE statement name text nest loop make clear loop intended
However language label must unique successive loop involving index variable use text label name variable index variable loop
The statement may used exit loop
Loops labeled may leave specific labeled loop group nested loop
Some dialect include statement terminate current loop iteration begin next
considered universal loop full syntax Further single iteration range could replaced list range
There several unusual aspect construct Subsequent standard allowed syntactic element replaced achieve small optimization
The compiler also incorporated Decrementing counting backwards using keyword instead The varies somewhat
The often block statement example would The publication commonly known also allows initial declaration loop
All three section loop optional
Contrary language defined class Number method two parameter end value using self start value
The statement may used exit loop
Loops labeled may leave specifically labeled loop group nested loop Maple two form one iterating range value iterating content container
The value range form follows All part except optional
The part present must come first
The remaining part appear order
Iterating container done using form loop The clause specifies container may list set sum product unevaluated function array object implementing iterator
A may terminated
In one use also non integer value The written initialises internal variable executes body long internal variable limit le increment negative end iteration increment internal variable
Before iteration value internal variable pushed onto stack
There also simple
The written repeat body exactly X time
As used use loop variable discouraged
Note Perl programming motto
The construct corresponding language called Do Mathematica Mathematica also For construct mimic language Note empty loop one command syntax error
If loop contained comment execution would result message
The imperative map expression list get iteration result list But want save space list authentic construction defined used Note original Oberon language omitted favor general Oberon loop construct
The reintroduced
You also iterate list item similar array language You may also use exit loop time
Unlike language AppleScript currently command continue next iteration loop
So code print also loop table using iterate numerically array iterate randomly dictionary
Generic making use Simple index loop Using array Using list string value The example available dialect CFML used
Simple index loop Using array Using list string value For extended see JavaScript support loop
The statement supported inside loop
Alternatively possible iterate key array
This print triangle several possible syntax including sample
See expression syntax
In implemented many way
Oftentimes directly translated compare instruction instruction
However always
In interpreted programming language simply translated
For instance take following code

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In computer programming loop sequence continually repeated certain condition reached
Typically certain process done getting item data changing condition checked whether counter reached prescribed number
If next instruction sequence instruction return first instruction sequence repeat sequence
If condition reached next instruction fall next sequential instruction branch outside loop
A loop fundamental programming idea commonly used writing program

In order individual imperative evaluated
The emphasis explicit control flow distinguishes language language
Within imperative statement execution result choice made two path follow
For functional language function language construct exist achieve result usually termed control flow statement
A set statement turn generally structured addition grouping also defines
mechanism alter flow control way similar subroutine usually occur response external stimulus event occur rather execution control flow statement
At level control flow instruction usually work altering
For CPUs control flow instruction available conditional unconditional instruction also termed jump
The kind control flow statement supported different language vary categorized effect A explicit name number assigned fixed position within may referenced control flow statement appearing elsewhere source code
A label mark position within source code effect
alternative named label used language placed start line text source code
Languages use often impose constraint line number must increase value following line may require consecutive
For example BASIC In language label usually appearing start line immediately followed colon
For example C The language allowed whole number identifier label linked colon following statement variant allowed whole number
The statement combination English word pronounced accordingly basic form unconditional transfer control
Although may either upper lower case depending language usually written The effect goto statement cause next statement executed statement appearing immediately indicated label
Goto statement many computer scientist notably
The terminology varies may alternatively known routine procedure function especially return result method especially belong
In computer memory small current standard subroutine used mainly reduce program size
A piece code written used many time various place program
Today subroutine often used help make program structured isolating algorithm hiding data access method
If many programmer working one program subroutine one kind help divide work
In structured programming ordered sequencing successive command considered one basic control structure used building block program alongside iteration recursion choice
In May Böhm Jacopini published article showed program could transformed form involving choice IF THEN ELSE loop WHILE condition DO xxx possibly duplicated code addition Boolean variable flag
Later author showed choice replaced loop yet Boolean variable
That minimalism possible mean necessarily desirable computer theoretically need subtract one number another branch result negative practical computer dozen even hundred machine instruction
What Böhm Jacopini article showed program could
Other research showed control structure one entry one exit much easier understand form mainly could used anywhere statement without disrupting control flow
In word
Later development recently composable continued strategy making component program even freely composable
Some academic took purist approach result argued even instruction like middle loop bad practice needed proof thus advocated loop single exit point
This purist approach embodied language designed preferred tool teaching introductory programming academia
The direct application theorem may result additional local variable introduced structured chart may also result
The latter issue called context
Pascal affected problem according empirical study cited student programmer difficulty formulating correct solution Pascal several simple problem including writing function searching element array
A study Henry Shapiro cited Roberts found using control structure correct solution given subject subject wrote incorrect code problem allowed write return middle loop
Most programming language control structure initial keyword indicates type control structure involved
Languages divide whether control structure final keyword
Conditional expression conditional construct feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Less common variation include compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action else otherwise taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
Case logic also implemented functional form statement
A loop sequence statement specified may carried several time succession
The code inside loop loop shown obeyed specified number time collection item condition met
In language loop expressed using rather explicit looping construct
special case recursion easily transformed iteration
Most programming language construction repeating loop certain number time
In case counting go downwards instead upwards step size used
In example N body loop may execute I value depending programming language
In many programming language integer reliably used loop
number represented imprecisely due hardware constraint loop might repeated time depending rounding error hardware compiler version
Furthermore increment X occurs repeated addition accumulated rounding error may mean value X iteration differ quite significantly expected sequence
Most programming language construction repeating loop condition change
Some variation test condition start loop others test end
If test start body may skipped completely end body always executed least
A value change detection method used within ordinary loop trigger processing group value
Values monitored within loop change diverts program flow handling group event associated
Several programming language later special construct allow implicit looping element array member set collection
generalise loop also support us
comprehension together provide similar function Scala
General iteration construct C statement form used express sort loop others looping number collection parallel
Where specific looping construct used usually preferred general iteration construct since often make purpose expression clearer
used assure program segment loop forever exceptional condition arises error
For instance program loop forever handling event occur stopping process terminated operator
Infinite loop implemented using control flow construct
Most commonly unstructured programming jump back goto structured programming indefinite loop loop set never end either omitting condition explicitly setting true
Some language special construct infinite loop typically omitting condition indefinite loop
Examples include Ada Fortran Go Ruby
Often infinite loop unintentionally created programming error loop wherein loop condition us variable never change within loop
Sometimes within body loop desire skip remainder loop body continue next iteration loop
Some language provide statement language Perl Ruby
The effect prematurely terminate innermost loop body resume normal next iteration
If iteration last one loop effect terminate entire loop early
Some language like Perl Ruby statement restarts current iteration start
Ruby statement restarts entire loop initial iteration
When using loop search table might desirable stop searching soon required item found
Some programming language provide statement language Perl effect terminate current loop immediately transfer control statement immediately loop
The following example done support
Both feature similar comparing code snippet show difference must combined statement construct
support conditional execution code depending whether loop exited early statement using loop
For example The clause example linked statement inner statement
Both Python loop support else clause executed early exit loop occurred
Some language support breaking nested loop theory circle called break
One common use example searching table
This done either via multilevel break break level bash PHP via labeled break break continue given label Java Perl
Alternatives multilevel break include single break together state variable tested break another level exception caught level broken placing nested loop function using return effect termination entire nested loop using label goto statement
C include multilevel break usual alternative use goto implement labeled break
Python multilevel break continue proposed rejected basis added complexity worth rare legitimate use
The notion break interest give rise today called
In refined proving possible avoid adding additional variable structured programming long break loop allowed
Furthermore Kosaraju proved strict hierarchy program exists every integer exists program containing break depth rewritten program break depth le without introducing added variable
One also subroutine executing looped statement breaking nested loop subroutine
There multiple break generally implemented exception instead
In textbook us Tennent notion explain similarity break return statement
Watt note class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
As commonly implemented however return sequencer may also carry return value whereas break sequencer implemented contemporary language usually
used express correctness loop
In practical term loop variant integer expression initial value
The variant value must decrease loop iteration must never become negative correct execution loop
Loop variant used guarantee loop terminate
A loop invariant assertion must true first loop iteration remain true iteration
This implies loop terminates correctly exit condition loop invariant satisfied
Loop invariant used monitor specific property loop successive iteration
Some programming language contain native support loop variant invariant
In case support specification
Some dialect provide extensive sublanguage describing Loops
An early example found Conversional Lisp
provides Loop macro implement sublanguage
Many programming language especially favoring dynamic style programming offer construct
These cause flow execution jump given context resume predeclared point
three common sort control construct exotic one also exist keyword
standard condition ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE raised intercepted ON action Programmers also define use named condition
Like one statement specified many case GOTO needed decide flow control resume
Unfortunately implementation substantial overhead space time especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE many programmer tried avoid using condition
Common Syntax example Modern language specialized structured construct exception handling rely use break return
For example one write Any number variety clause used
If matching particular control percolate back subroutine call nested block matching found end main program reached point program forcibly stopped suitable error message
Via influence keyword reserved declaring exception handler language popular today like Java C
Some language like Ada use keyword introduce exception handler may even employ different keyword Ada pattern matching
A language like incorporate placeholder exception handler syntax automatically extract several piece information exception occurs
This approach exemplified construct AppleScript David Watt textbook also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article section early exit loop
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
Watt note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding explicit code ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
In Object Pascal D Java C Python clause added construct
No matter control leaf code inside clause guaranteed execute
This useful writing code must relinquish expensive resource opened file database connection finished processing Since pattern fairly common C special syntax Upon leaving compiler guarantee object released effectively variable file stream abstracting side effect initializing releasing file
Python statement Ruby block argument used similar effect
All language mentioned define standard exception circumstance thrown
Users throw exception fact allows user throw catch almost type including basic type like whereas language like Java permissive
C introduced async keyword supporting direct style
also known semicoroutines allow control yielded consumer method temporarily typically using keyword
Like async keyword support programming direct style
function yield control form without thread
Coroutines implemented library programming language provides either continuation generator distinction coroutines generator practice technical detail
In spoof article Lawrence Clark suggested GOTO statement could replaced statement provides entertaining example
COMEFROM implemented one named
article Structured Programming go Statements identifies two situation covered control structure listed gave example control structure could handle situation
Despite utility construct yet found way mainstream programming language
The following proposed If omitted get loop test top
If omitted get loop test bottom
If omitted get infinite loop
Hence single construction replace several construction programming language
A possible variant allow one test within loop use see next section appears cover case better
Languages lacking construct generally emulate using equivalent idiom In loop construct represented using standard infinite loop clause middle confused statement following section
Naming loop like example optional permit leaving outer loop several nested loop
This proposed
A modified version presented
used specify event may occur within occurrence indicated using name event statement
When event occur relevant action carried control pass
This construction provides clear separation determining situation applies action taken situation

Loop available

We use loop write program repeat action many time
The three kind loop Java loop loop loop
They equivalent expressive power
rewrite loop us one loop construct loop us one
The loop following form
The execution loop start evaluating Boolean expression
If condition evaluates body loop executed body executed execution go back loop condition
If loop condition evaluates skip loop body continue executing program following loop
The following loop compute sum number
It start initializing variable variable
We use variable accumulate sum number covered far variable used count number
The loop body execute value counter variable time execute body increase current value increase counter variable one
The loop following form
The difference loop loop loop condition executed execute body loop
That loop execution start executing loop body loop condition evaluated first time
If loop condition evaluates execution jump back beginning loop execute body
If hand loop body evaluates exit loop continue program following loop
The loop therefore executes body loop convenient situation
The loop must terminated semicolon
The following loop computes sum number
The loop following form
It convenient remember loop term corresponding loop achieves effect
The following program us loop compute sum number
Notice example separate initial statement loop condition statement using semicolon statement inside initial statement separated using comma
As see loop useful writing provides u mean initialize counter variable n loop condition control number time execute loop used increase counter
In example used counting loop knew advance many time would like execute loop body
This example show use loop performs computation result achieved
Diving number amount counting many time subtract
We therefore compute division subtracting long possible time perform subtraction count
When subtraction longer possible count result division value left remainder division

We use loop count number guess far
In addition use use indicate user guessed number correctly exit loop
In following program read sequence positive number input find maximal among
We use number indicate end input
In case use loop since want execute loop body least user enter least one number
The body loop contain statement include loop
The following program print multiplication table number
The main loop outer loop iterating loop responsible iterating row multiplication table
The inner loop iterating value print row corresponding multiplied number
Note use special character represents tabulator tab

A number divisible
We check number prime checking divisible number
If divisible number number prime
The following program us loop iterate number check dive number
If divide use indicator variable mark prime
We use indicator variable loop condition exit loop soon find number
Since know check number prime write program print prime number

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I studying CPU I trying implement small CPU like
Control unit get instruction generates give several control signal part CPU ALU PC ACC etc
And I know work one clock cycle
But I quetions
Each one clock cycle signal first next
Since CPU electronic equipment would mean current flowing turn would mean current flow turn
So control signal connected clock cycle circuit turn clock cycle time ignore delay circuit
If control signal although clock cycle I state hypothesis Clock signal meaningful used signal toggle
Control unit work signal stay value since recognize time going
Is true false
Here structure one simple CPUs
If want store data memory address PC IR increase PC PC PC manual say setting control signal would
Note value PC go ALU output ALU since Asel A selector Bsel
But since PCce PC chip enabler PC change value input PC output ALU
It seems good make PC
But question This infinite loop theoritically since would go ALU would save PC would go ALU would save PC one clock cycle end
To avoid controlling timing would different control signal
Is really true another solution
Thanks
Almost every component CPU need synchronized clock mean work clock high never low alternatively rising edge
This could example implemented using input component first clock signal second input
So component get new input clock currently high else nothing
And clock speed set longest time signal need propagate circuit CPU system preventing signal arriving signal ready thus keep everything safe synchronized
The control signal set time accepted high clock
This loop since PC actually register egde triggered
This mean like mentioned changing state one time per cycle short period time
At earlier time last output ALU PC waiting input PC
Then next cycle PC take input
This PC PC actually happens

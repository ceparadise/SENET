In used describe fashion
First proposed computer scientist generalization arrow provide way expressing relationship step computation
Unlike monad arrow limit step one one input
As result found use among application
While arrow use recognized distinct class Hughes would publish first definition
Until monad proven sufficient problem requiring combination program logic pure code
However useful library certain efficient parser defied rewriting monadic form
The formal concept arrow developed explain exception monadic code process monad turned arrow
Since arrow active area research
Their underlying law operation refined several time recent formulation arrow calculus requiring five law
In form proper subset Hughes arrow
While believed arrow time since proven arrow even general
In fact arrow merely equivalent directly equal Freyd category
Like type class arrow thought set quality applied
In arrow allow represented Haskell symbol combine form
However actual term arrow may also come fact arrow correspond also known arrow category theory different Kleisli category
As relatively new concept single standard definition formulation logically equivalent feature required method strictly obey certain mathematical law
The description currently used Haskell two basic operation Although two procedure strictly necessary define arrow method derived make arrow easier work practice theory
As arrow third operation class category One helpful method derived combination previous three In addition procedure arrow must obey certain rule type may applied The remaining law restrict piping method behaves order composition reversed also allowing simplifying Arrows may extended fit specific situation defining additional operation restriction
Commonly used version include arrow choice allow computation make decision arrow allow step take output input
Another set arrow known arrow application rarely used practice actually equivalent monad
Arrows several benefit mostly stemming ability make program logic explicit yet concise
Besides avoiding creates opportunity
This turn theoretically lead better easier feature like
Although program strictly requires arrow generalize away much dense pure declarative code would otherwise require
They also encourage giving common linkage program step class definition
The ability apply type generically also contributes reusability keep simple
Arrows disadvantage including initial effort defining arrow satisfies arrow law
Because monad usually easier implement extra feature arrow may unnecessary often preferable use monad
Another issue applies many construct efficiently code arrow style used computer

In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

I Googled long time I still understand work explanation technical illustration make clearer
My primary confusion virtual memory
I hope question good explanation people ask question find Google
I admit two concept seem quite complicated similar beginning
Sometimes also taught confusingly
A good reference opinion found For sake completion I try explain I guarantee correctness I developed OS month
Segmentation older concept opinion confusing
Segmentation work name say
A segment continuous block memory specific size
To access memory within segment need
This make total two address component fact stored two register
One idea segmentation enlarge memory register
The sort protection elaborate one paging
Because use two register access memory split memory chunk said called segment
Consider memory
This split bit register segment byte
Of course also bit register offset
Addressing byte bit quite useless decided segment overlap I think also performance programming reason back
The following formula used access memory segmentation This mean segment time offset
This also mean address accessed many way
also
This segmentation old day
If look assembler program try something see even called register assembler CS DS code segment data segment
Later called GDT introduced
This global table specific position RAM segment number memory address several option segment given
This brings u nearer concept paging still
So programmer decide segment start
A new concept also GDT one could decide long segment
So segment long bit register limit could defined programmer
You could overlapping segment also purely separated segment
When accessing A B still two register used accessing memory A entry GDT
So look entry GDT see memory location segment start large
We check B offset within allowed memory area
Now paging different newer segmentation approach paging page fixed size
So limit longer programmable page currently
Furthermore unlike segmentation logical address space continuous without physical address continuous
Paging also us table look stuff still split logical address part
The first part number entry page table second part offset
However offset fixed length bit access
You also two part multiple page table used
Two level page table quite common system I think even three level page table common
I hope I able explain least bit I think exaplanation also confusing
Best thing dive kernel programming try implement basic stuff booting OS
Then find everything due backwards compability everything still modern PCs
I direct Segmentation starting die
I suspect paging well future
Edit Let add clarification Segmentation paging two difference mean memory management typically two thing
At risk oversimplification Segmentation allows process access memory natural pointer size would allow
Paging allows process access memory system physically support
Segments The bit system
That allows addressing memory
Late system much memory
A process could map different segment physical memory
A process could access memory could change memory could access within
The successor brought segmenting high art
Using even complex system base register process could access larger area memory
Paging Is system process see continuous relatively range memory address divided page
For example VAX processor bit address allowing access memory theoretically computer typically memory
A process could access much memory system physically plus multiple process
These system presented continuous range memory process virtual memory divided page around byte defined set table mapped disk storage
If process accessed page memory triggered hardware exception
The operating system would intercept exception allocate new page physical memory load memory disk restart instruction
If operating system needed memory handle request would page memory already loaded
If data read usually would loaded executable image would paged
The page could marked invalid
If memory page would written page file storage needed
The Intel chip introduced bizarre system combined segment paging
Segments used data protection
The processor mode away

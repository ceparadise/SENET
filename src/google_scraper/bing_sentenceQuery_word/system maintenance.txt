Here helpful chart describes difference similarity among major
Arts Sciences Building Room Phone

Computer system made hardware software work together perform multitude computing task
All component computer system including actual data stored system require periodic maintenance operate peak efficiency
Failure perform maintenance hardware software data eventually result slow performance eventual failure system
Computers machine require maintenance like machine
Technicians run diagnostics various component identify weak failing circuit clean interior machine removing dust foreign material
Technicians also update software built computer circuitry called firmware
Computer hardware useful without software tell
In addition firmware computer need operating system large software program run computer facilitates running application software
Both operating system application require maintenance form software update
These update contain fix bug security update
Periodic software update provide stability security computer software
Computer hardware software combine provide platform storing retrieving information quickly
After month year storing new information database become bloated inefficient
Occasional maintenance information includes archiving purging obsolete information reorganizing database house information
Database reorganization improves information retrieval time facilitating user productivity
The Windows operating system come several maintenance program improve efficiency computer
Disk Cleanup Disk Defragmenter Check Disk three useful maintenance utility improve performance computer
Computers operate number different environment ranging clean data center user overcrowded cubicle
While desktop computer seem tolerate le sterile condition failure provide clean cool environment shorten life personal computer
Mainframes require clean room operate properly
Dust heat two worst enemy computing equipment providing clean environment extend life computer regardless size
Alan Hughes year experience IT including mainframe programming network project management security disaster recovery information system hardware
He hold master degree applied computer science several certification
He currently teach information technology university level

Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun
Not mention lucrative career opportunity

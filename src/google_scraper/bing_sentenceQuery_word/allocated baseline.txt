I want better understand OS provides heap memory process
Here heap memory I mean memory allocated dynamically say call
Heap allocator typically call system call reserve region page dole chunk call
The system call Unix used implementation sometimes use well
I think window us totally clear
A good resource
Short answer summarizing answer It done operating system
Simple early operating system assigned fixed size area code data stack heap idea stack heap grew towards
Early Unix system space stack area data used also heap could extended specialized system call
More modern system use virtual memory bound limited contiguous address space anymore
So program ask extra address usually via similar library handling heap dole part asked
How exactly work depends programming language different language pose different requirement facility underlying kernel offer
To answer question short answer yes
The long answer executable linked also field executable header For Unix operating system
Windows us
determine initial size static data area stack heap
For question short answer depends
Since modern operating system today use virtual memory common use Virtual Memory Addressing program given separate memory space
The size memory space either system system
A good discussion layout running program Linux
A request operating system map page extend range valid address program use
These new range backed physical RAM swapped disk
With said program type fixed size
For example old era something known COre iMage file executable allocated fixed
Although nature machine back day COM file could access entire memory map machine without consequence
Other machine type different version
Current Unix implementation however support ELF executable type possibly others
Executable script file equivalent file Windows use interpreter ELF binary

In baseline agreed description attribute product point time serf basis defining change
A change movement baseline next state
The identification significant change baseline state central purpose identification
Typically significant state receive formal approval status either explicitly implicitly
An approval status may marked individually prior definition status established project leader signified association position established baseline
Nevertheless approval status usually recognized publicly
Thus baseline may also mark approved configuration item
signed execution
In similar manner associating multiple configuration item baseline indicates item approved
Generally baseline may single work product set work product used logical basis comparison
A baseline may also established basis subsequent select activity work product meet certain criterion
Such activity may attributed formal approval
Conversely configuration project often includes one baseline status configuration metric collected
The current configuration refers current status current audit current metric
Similarly le frequently baseline may refer item associated specific project
This may include revision item latest revision item project depending upon context
A baseline may specific type baseline body item particular certifying
Some example include While marking approval status cover majority us baseline baseline may also established signify progress work passage time
In case baseline visible measure endured collective effort
developmental baseline
Baselines may also mark
Baselines valued use identify notable state work product also provide historical view work product element proceeded together time
When historical baseline retrieved state work product subset share significance history change allows project leader compare relative progress single part project project whole allows project leader identify individual item lag lead progress toward better functionality performance
For reason baseline identification monitoring retrieval critical success configuration management
Once retrieved baseline may compared particular configuration another baseline
Most baseline established fixed point time serve continue reference point identification state
However baseline established carry forward reference item regardless change item
These latter baseline evolve progression work effort continue identify notable work product project
In process performing configuration management configuration item work product may assigned baseline establish certain status
In sense baseline work product may require certain change work product ensure conforms characteristic associated baseline referenced
This varies upon context many case requires work product reset initial possibly inherently approved state work may proceed
In many environment baseline controlled certain subsequent activity work product baseline either prohibited permitted
These activity selected controlled depending upon configuration management system also monitored
Consequently baseline ordinarily subjected configuration management audit
may include examination specific action performed baseline identification individual involved action evaluation change within baseline certification approval accounting metric collection comparison another baseline
Though common software system label existence baseline found several domain
Baselines found modeling system business rule management system among others
In addition field hardware software engineering baseline found medicine
monitoring health progress politics
statistic physic chemistry
observation change finance
others

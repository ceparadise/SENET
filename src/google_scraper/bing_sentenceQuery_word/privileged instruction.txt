There basically mode modern OS work
User mode kernel mode
Whenever system boot OS transfer control kernel mode kernel run necessary routine kernel switch user mode
User mode allows user run program choice
However instruction could alter part OS resource IO system marked These instruction allowed run kernel mode Kernel executes instruction return control User Depends type privilege instruction Operating system two type instruction core OS
IT IS RESPOSNIBLE FOR ALLOCATING OF VARIOUS TYPES OF COMPUTER RESOURCES LIKE And many task related functioning OS Privileged Instructions Machines two kind instruction instruction add sub etc
instruction initiate switch state vector context protected memory etc
Operating system hide privileged instruction provide virtual instruction access manipulate virtual resource disc file Virtual instruction system call Operating system interpret virtual instruction Still question

Privileged instruction instruction usually executed operating system specific mode
An instruction statement acted upon computer language
Examples privileged instruction used include operation involving management coordinated effort provide sufficient memory process computer system
The existence privileged instruction specifically allow operating system perform certain operation allowed perform
To allow privileged instruction mode added computer software indicate one two dual mode monitor mode user mode
The privileged instruction executed running monitor supervisor mode mode enables execution instruction
Thus operating system contains routine execute particular privileged instruction
The monitor mode normal operating state computer
If attempt made execute privileged instruction user state microprocessor execute instruction
The user mode least privileged state state application program run

I added code compiles cleanly received Windows error I go bug hunt I expecting something silly I done happens produce message
The code compiles cleanly error warning
The size EXE file grown byte includes link otherwise pure C API DEBUG running Windows
To answer question privileged instruction processor assembler instruction executed supervisor mode
These type instruction tend used access device protected data structure window kernel
Regular program execute user mode disallows direct access device etc As others mentioned cause probably corrupted stack messed function pointer call
This sort thing usually happens using function pointer point invalid data
It also happen code trash return stack
It sometimes quite tricky track sort bug usually hard reproduce
A privileged instruction instruction allowed executed
kernel mode
If hitting userspace either got really old EXE corrupted binary
First probability I think may using local array near top function declaration
Your bound checking gone insane overwrite return address point instruction kernel allowed execute
As I suspected something silly I
I think I solved twice fast clue comment message
Thanks especially pointed something early app overwriting stack
I actually found several answer useful post I marked answering question clued queued look though I think best sum answer
As turned I added button went maximum size array holding tool bar button information stack
I forgotten even existed
The error location seems really small executable code usually life
I agree Daniel look like wild pointer
I saw Visual year
The debug library call physical instruction exception handler
If I remember correctly dumping status port used DMA base register I assume someone Microsoft using debugger card
Look error condition might latent causing diagnostics code run
I debugging backtracked read dissassembly
It exception processing maybe indexing end
The CPU processor manufactured last year special instruction powerful
These privileged instruction kept operating system kernel application able used user written program
This restricts damage program inflict upon system cut number time system actually crash
When executing kernel mode operating system unrestricted access kernel user program memory
The load instruction base limit register privileged instruction

In defined delegation authority
A privilege allows user perform action
Examples various privilege include ability create read delete file access read write communicating
Users delegated extra level control called privileged
Users lack privilege defined unprivileged regular normal user
Privileges either automatic granted applied
An automatic privilege exists requirement permission perform action
For example system people required log system use logging require privilege
Systems implement file protection essentially give unlimited privilege perform action file
A granted privilege exists result presenting credential privilege granting authority
This usually accomplished logging system username password supplied correct user granted additional privilege
A privilege applied either executed program issuing request advanced privilege running program apply additional privilege
An example user applying additional privilege provided command run command user authentication system
Modern processor architecture multiple allows OS run different
Some processor two level processor four level least privilege
Tasks tagged privilege level
Resources segment page port etc
privileged instruction tagged demanded privilege level
When task try use resource execute privileged instruction processor determines whether permission protection fault interrupt generated
This prevents user task damaging OS
In computer programming exception related privileged instruction violation may caused array accessed bound invalid pointer dereferenced invalid memory location referenced privileged location one controlling device
This particularly likely occur programming language C use pointer arithmetic check array bound automatically
On system commonly known owns privilege
Ordinary user granted enough permission accomplish common task
UNIX system security feature
Most user set new user account administrative procedure
The user root special user something called anything system
This high degree power necessary fully administer UNIX system also allows user make mistake cause system problem
Unprivileged user usually On system privilege delegated varying degree
These delegation defined using
The following abbreviated list default assignment Windows defines number administrative privilege assigned individually user group
An account user hold privilege granted either directly indirectly group membership
Upon installation number group account created privilege granted
However grant changed later time though
Unlike Linux privilege implicitly permanently granted specific account
Some administrative privilege
taking ownership restoring arbitrary file powerful used malicious intent could allow entire system compromised
With default since Windows Vista Windows strip user token privilege login
Thus user log account broad system privilege still system privilege
Whenever user want perform administrative action requiring system privilege process
When launching process user made aware administrative privilege asserted prompt requiring consent
Not holding privilege actually required keeping
Elevated process run full privilege full privilege
Even privilege user may still required particular process thus completely
The Windows ME Windows Windows previous version Windows operated FAT filesystem support filesystem therefore privilege effectively defeated Windows system use file system
The name used Windows source code end either Privilege LogonRight
This led confusion full set Rights Privileges called
Microsoft currently us term User Rights
In past term also used Microsoft Privilege Rights logon user right

I trying understand virtual machine monitor VMM virtualizes CPU
My understanding right CPU issue protection fault interrupt privileged instruction executed CPU user mode
In high level language like C privileged instruction wrapped inside system call
For example application need current date time instruction interact device privileged call certain library function
The assembled version library function contains instruction called cause trap CPU
The CPU switch user mode privileged mode jump trap handler OS provided
Each system call trap handler
In example trap handler read date time hardware clock return CPU switch privileged user mode
source However I quite sure understanding correct
This article mention notion privileged popf instruction cause trap thus complicates thing VMM
In understanding popf instruction cause trap protection fault interrupt explicitly called user program system call
So two concrete question This question came site student researcher practitioner computer science
In particular order Your confusion mainly caused fact operating system community standardized vocabulary
Here term get slung around sometimes mean thing sometimes
Any individual author generally use term consistently different author define differently
There different kind event cause entry privileged mode
Each interrupt trap fault different number associated
In case Note confusing name interrupt vector table
Even though called table used fault trap well
Which lead author call interrupt
The issue rather subtle
This essentially bug architecture
When executes user mode cause trap fault exception interrupt whatever want call
It simply act noop
Does matter
Well normal OS really matter
If hand implementing virtual machine monitor like VMWare Xen VMM running protected mode like run guest operating system efficiently emulate protected mode code
When guest operating system us instruction generate general protection fault
The instruction generate general protection fault called user mode want
I expert computer architecture
But I several opinion consideration By posting answer agree

Although many technique purported increase creativity attribute listing morphological analysis force field analysis mind mapping idea checklist see Nemiro review apply technique VTs much laboratory research examined idea generation relied brainstorming paradigm
Group team member instructed generate many idea b say anything everything think c integrate idea presented better one criticize others idea Bouchard Hare Osborn
Osborn found others Meadow Parnes Reese Parnes Meadow brainstorming group produce idea kind group critical group group also believed brainstorming group could generate better idea individual working alone
In fact Osborn predicted group member followed brainstorming rule would generate twice many idea member worked alone although alternating individual group brainstorming would yield better result
According several model brainstorming Brown Paulus Nijstad Stroebe Paulus Dzindolet order generate idea individual must search memory category knowledge relevant problem
Ideas generated within selected memory category category attention switched different category reason
New memory category searched idea created attention diverted
Several model brainstorming suggest brainstorming group team stimulate people search memory category might otherwise considered specific idea shared one member stimulate related idea combined idea presented earlier Brown Paulus Nijstad Stroebe
However brainstorming group always generate idea combined output equal number people brainstorming separately nominal group Mullen Johnson Salas
Although group idea offer cognitive stimulation lead synergy negative force group deal
Brainstorming team may generate many idea individual due production blocking consequence fact one member group speak time Diehl Stroebe Nijstad Stroebe
While listening others waiting speak one may forget idea one wanted share decide share group may seem similar idea another group member generated dissimilar current topic
Group brainstormers tend generate idea smaller set topic individual limiting range idea generate Larey Paulus
Waiting speak may interrupt flow idea one need creative
Finally evaluation apprehension fear negatively evaluated Camacho Paulus social loafing exerting le effort performing task group alone Karau Williams may decrease number idea generated team

Brainstorming group method involves spontaneous contribution creative idea solution
This technique requires intensive freewheeling discussion every member group encouraged think aloud suggest many idea possible based diverse knowledge
Brainstorming combine informal approach lateral thinking method developing new concept solve problem looking innovative way
Some idea built original creative solution problem others generate additional idea
Some expert believe brainstorming better conventional group interaction might hindered
Group think phenomenon occurs team need consensus overshadows judgment individual group member
Although group brainstorming frequently better generating idea normal group several study shown individual brainstorming produce better idea group brainstorming
This occur group member pay much attention others idea forget create idea
Also group always adhere good brainstorming practice
During brainstorming session participant avoid criticizing rewarding idea order explore new possibility break incorrect answer

In team member contribute idea electronic mean either synchronously asynchronously
The brainstorming software selected team mediates individual interaction help organize shape product brainstorming session
Computer supported brainstorming implemented using wide variety electronic technology
In traditional group member team present physical location interaction defined selected protocol
Proponents Gallupe et al
argue electronic brainstorming eliminates many problem standard brainstorming including
group member must take turn express idea evaluation apprehension
fear judged others
Brainstorming exists many form first began formalized graphical representation known Joseph Novak
Concept mapping involved collecting organizing information hierarchical fashion
Seth Hollander student said first individual formally propose use computer assist brainstorming concept mapping
In Master Science thesis Creativity Policy Process Hollander suggested interactive computer program designed enhance creative thinking
One year later The Idea Generator first software computer supported brainstorming became publicly available
In GroupSystems Software Aided Meeting Management SAMM system took advantage emerging computer networking technology installed room dedicated computer supported meeting
When using electronic meeting system EMS came called group member simultaneously independently entered idea computer terminal
The software collected pooled idea list could displayed central screen anonymously desired
Researchers found use computer supported system helped group categorize idea eliminate duplicate promote assessment discussion prioritized controversial issue
Numerous software platform designed computer supported brainstorming advantage disadvantage traditional brainstorming depending specific circumstance
The feature software title similar Collaborative brainstorming software used number way
It could used place traditional note card method outlining essay make big concept understandable visualize scope marketing campaign organize interview note
Following several example business use cited Social Signal social medium blog Some example technology key feature As technology advanced computer supported brainstorming system
Now brainstorming system allow contributor post comment anonymously use
This technique also allows user log extended time period typically one two week allow participant soak time posting idea feedback
This technique used particularly field new applied number area requiring collection evaluation idea

Avatars virtual world allow brainstorming visual synchronous asynchronous anonymous different location
The advantage computer supported brainstorming traditional brainstorming shown greatest larger group
Computer supported brainstorming beneficial small group likely limited number participant eliminated evaluation apprehension production blocking capability electronic system
The major benefit computer supported brainstorming software arises anonymity participant archiving data elimination wait time turn taking ability incorporate additional feedback tool reduce social loafing
Another advantage computer supported brainstorming software idea archived electronically original form retrieved later thought discussion
The archiving data later review also stimulate creativity idea revisited refined time
The ability review revise idea others also advantage elimination wait time computer supported brainstorming software
Some software program show idea generated via chat room
The display idea may cognitively stimulate brainstorm participant attention kept flow idea generated without potential distraction social cue facial expression verbal language
Early researcher computer supported brainstorming expressed concern simultaneous contribution multiple idea would cause reduce productivity
Studies show computer supported brainstorming actually help increase focus thus increasing effectiveness virtual session brainstorming
feature computer supported brainstorming software help mitigate potential information overload differentiate individual contribution
The use color coding shown reduce confusion arising simultaneous contribution idea well increasing motivation contribution idea individual team member easily identified
Computer supported brainstorming technique shown produce idea help individual focus attention idea others better brain writing technique participant write individual written note silence subsequently communicate group
The production idea linked fact paying attention others idea lead brainstormer participant try avoid replicating repeating another participant comment idea
In study Cooper et al
author found evidence controversial idea produced member anonymous computer supported group member group
The author also found clear evidence anonymous brainstorming group produced idea brainstorming group
Some computer supported brainstorming software includes tracking component help reduce
Social loafing people exert le effort working collectively compared working individually
Shepherd et al
found including social comparison tracker brainstorming system increased output group using computer supported brainstorming compared control group using computer supported brainstorming social comparison
The perceived effectiveness computer brainstorming software mediated ease use technology
In comparing result several study researcher found software perceived difficult use student preferred collaborate using whiteboard
When software perceived easy use student preferred online environment
Electronic brainstorming cause loss productivity group member become highly focused work work others instead finding productivity balance
The idea listed group member screen lead member spend much time reading others idea instead entering idea
This occurs often synchronous idea generation prevent individual paying attention others contribution formulating idea
When member trying create original idea become overly focused duplicating idea unable come
Electronic brainstorming ability help group member spur new idea exposed idea generated others
However compared brainstorming electronic brainstorming actually force group member spend additional time cognitive resource reading understanding interpreting idea instead coming new idea creating greater increase time needed brainstorming
Even technology place help facilitator guide electronic brainstorming still need leadership
While use advance effective use group technology replace need group leadership
However related group size electronic brainstorming superior traditional verbal brainstorming large group

effort made find conclusion specific problem gathering list idea spontaneously contributed member
The term popularized book Advertising executive began developing method
He frustrated employee inability develop creative idea individually ad campaign
In response began hosting session discovered significant improvement quality quantity idea produced employee
Osborn outlined method book chapter How Organize Squad Create Ideas
claimed two principle contribute ideative efficacy Following two principle four general rule brainstorming established intention Osborn note brainstorming address specific question held session addressing multiple question inefficient
Further problem must require generation idea rather judgment us example generating possible name product proper brainstorming material whereas analytical judgment whether marry need brainstorming
Osborn envisioned group around participant including expert novice
Participants encouraged provide wild unexpected answer
Ideas receive criticism discussion
The group simply provides idea might lead solution apply analytical judgment feasibility
The judgment reserved later date
Participants asked write idea anonymously
Then facilitator collect idea group vote idea
The vote simple show hand favor given idea
This process called distillation
After distillation top ranked idea may sent back group subgroup brainstorming
For example one group may work color required product
Another group may work size forth
Each group come back whole group ranking listed idea
Sometimes idea previously dropped may brought forward group idea
It important facilitator trained process attempting facilitate technique
The group primed encouraged embrace process
Like team effort may take practice session train team method tackling important idea
Each person circular group writes one idea pass piece paper next person add thought
This continues everybody get original piece paper back
By time likely group extensively elaborated idea
The group may also create idea book post distribution list routing slip front book
On first page description problem
The first person receive book list idea route book next person distribution list
The second person log new idea add idea previous person
This continues distribution list exhausted
A read meeting held discus idea logged book
This technique take longer allows individual time think deeply problem
This method brainstorming work method
It may improve collaboration increase quantity idea designed attendee participate idea rejected
The process begin topic
Each participant brainstorm individually idea merged onto one large idea map
During consolidation phase participant may discover common understanding issue share meaning behind idea
During sharing new idea may arise association added map well
Once idea captured group prioritize take action
Directed brainstorming variation electronic brainstorming described
It done manually computer
Directed brainstorming work solution space set criterion evaluating good idea known prior session
If known criterion used constrain process intentionally
In directed brainstorming participant given one sheet paper electronic form told brainstorming question
They asked produce one response stop paper form randomly swapped among participant
The participant asked look idea received create new idea improves idea based initial criterion
The form swapped respondent asked improve upon idea process repeated three round
In laboratory directed brainstorming found almost triple productivity group electronic brainstorming
A guided brainstorming session time set aside brainstorm either individually collective group particular subject constraint perspective time
This type brainstorming remove cause conflict constrains conversation stimulating critical creative thinking engaging balanced environment
Participants asked adopt different mindset period time contributing idea central mind map drawn scribe
Having examined point view participant seemingly see simple solution collectively create greater growth
Action assigned individually
Following guided brainstorming session participant emerge idea ranked brainstorming research question remaining unanswered prioritized assigned actionable list leaf everyone clear understanding need happen next ability visualize combined future focus greater goal group
Individual brainstorming use brainstorming solitary situation
It typically includes technique free speaking word association drawing visual note taking technique people diagram thought
Individual brainstorming useful method shown superior traditional group brainstorming
This process involves brainstorming rather trying come immediate answer short term solution
Theoretically technique inhibit participation need provide solution
The answer question form framework constructing future action plan
Once list question set may necessary prioritize reach best solution orderly way
Questorming another term mode inquiry
Although brainstorming take place online commonly available technology email interactive web site also many effort develop customized computer software either replace enhance one manual element brainstorming process
Early effort GroupSystems University Arizona Software Aided Meeting Management SAMM system University Minnesota took advantage computer networking technology installed room dedicated computer supported meeting
When using EMS came called group member simultaneously independently entered idea computer terminal
The software collected pool idea list could displayed central projection screen anonymized desired
Other element EMSs could support additional activity categorization idea elimination duplicate assessment discussion prioritized controversial idea
Later EMSs capitalized advance computer networking internet protocol support asynchronous brainstorming session extended period time multiple location
Introduced along EMS Nunamaker colleague University Arizona electronic brainstorming EBS
By utilizing customized computer software group EBS replace brainstorming
An example groupware software developed University Arizona
After idea discussion posted displayed group member computer
As group member simultaneously type comment separate computer comment anonymously pooled made available group member evaluation elaboration
Compared brainstorming EBS enhanced efficiency eliminating travelling group discussion also excluded several psychological constraint associated meeting
Identified Gallupe colleague reduced idea generation due forgetting idea brainstorming evaluation apprehension general concern experienced individual others presence evaluating reduced EBS
These positive psychological effect increase group size
A perceived advantage EBS idea archived electronically original form retrieved later thought discussion
EBS also enables much larger group brainstorm topic would normally productive traditional brainstorming session
Computer supported brainstorming may overcome challenge faced traditional brainstorming method
For example idea might pooled automatically individual need wait take turn verbal brainstorming
Some software program show idea generated via chat room
The display idea may cognitively stimulate brainstormers attention kept flow idea generated without potential distraction social cue facial expression verbal language
EBS technique shown produce idea help individual focus attention idea others better brainwriting technique participant write individual written note silence subsequently communicate group
The production idea linked fact paying attention others idea lead brainstormers try avoid replicate repeat another participant comment idea
Conversely production gain associated EBS le found situation EBS group member focused much generating idea ignored idea expressed others
The production gain associated user attentiveness idea expressed others documented Dugosh colleague
EBS group member instructed attend idea generated others outperformed term creativity
According comparing EBS brainstorming conducted DeRosa colleague EBS found enhance production idea quality idea produced
Despite advantage demonstrated EBS group EBS group member reported le satisfaction brainstorming process compared brainstorming group member
Some brainstorming technique allow contributor post comment anonymously use avatar
This technique also allows user log extended time period typically one two week allow participant soak time posting idea feedback
This technique used particularly field new product development applied number area requiring collection evaluation idea
Some limitation EBS include fact flood people many idea one time attend people may also compare performance others analyzing many idea individual produce social matching
Some research indicates incentive augment creative process
Participants divided three condition
In Condition I flat fee paid participant
In Condition II participant awarded point every unique idea subject paid point earned
In Condition III subject paid based impact idea group measured counting number group idea derived specific subject idea
Condition III outperformed Condition II Condition II outperformed Condition I statistically significant level measure
The result demonstrated participant willing work far longer achieve unique result expectation compensation
A good deal research refutes Osborn claim group brainstorming could generate idea individual working alone
For example review study group brainstorming Michael Diehl found overwhelmingly group brainstorming together produce fewer idea individual working separately
However conclusion brought question subsequent review study Scott Isaksen showed misunderstanding tool weak application method including lack facilitation artificiality problem group undermined study validity conclusion
Several factor contribute loss effectiveness group brainstorming
Because one participant may give idea one time participant might forget idea going contribute share see longer important relevant
Further view brainstorming cognitive process participant generates idea generation process store memory memorization process eventually extract memory express output process blocking even critical challenge may also inhibit person train thought generating idea remembering
Exchanging idea group may reduce number domain group explores additional idea
Members may also conform idea member decreasing novelty variety idea even though overall number idea might decrease
Evaluation apprehension determined occur instance personal evaluation
If assumption collective assessment place judgment idea ostensibly induction evaluation apprehension failed induce significant variance
Individuals may feel idea le valuable combined idea group large
Indeed Diehl Stroebe demonstrated even individual worked alone produced fewer idea told output would judged group others told output would judged individually
However experimentation revealed marginal contributor productivity loss type session real nominal group contributed much
Extroverts shown outperform introvert computer mediated group
Extroverts also generated unique diverse idea introvert additional method used stimulate idea generation completing small related task brainstorming given list classic rule brainstorming
One phenomenon group brainstorming participant tend alter rate productivity match others group
This lead participant generating fewer idea group setting would individually decrease contribution perceive productive group average
On hand phenomenon also increase individual rate production meet group average

The K W Network Feb I conducting research innovation specifically looked patenting technological innovation
I published paper recently former doctoral student Rotman School Keyvan Vakili London Business School called I want tell little bit sword found
Basically research innovation idea breakthrough innovation highest impact one produced call combination process distant diverse knowledge
What found study one creative process creative process contribute breakthrough innovation

In study examined patent sphere nanotechnology emerging exciting new field lot breakthrough idea year found patent novel term knowledge also high impact term economic value
Patents novel economic value valuable
And total patent rare breakthrough knowledge breakthrough economic value
But get highest impact patent
Patents novel economic value valuable
And total For practitioner important thing remember creativity happens combination process
We idea world bringing distant diverse knowledge together way get creative insight certainly true
However discovered equally important process deep dive deep knowledge one domain
So designing R D process new product development process around kind diversity idea combination may trouble deep knowledge need
This relates idea brainstorming
Everyone think going solve creative problem coming together brainstorming
What would say brainstorming enough without deep knowledge development would need particular domain understand issue break away existing way thinking
This study actually quite surprising found something expect find
Prior study innovation particular study look patenting scientific invention focused measuring breakthrough innovation according measure economic value
In patent world measure economic value many time get cited patent
What mean time go get patent patent office required list prior patent essential development idea
And time patent get cited prior patent essential development idea valuable patent
And field innovation study tend measure breakthrough innovation patent get many many citation subsequent patent saying really foundational idea
That way historically field always measured innovation
We actually adapted computer science method called topic modeling look text patent understand language patent could see shift language would allow u understand new novel idea developed
So language change based methodology able say That breakthrough idea talking domain fundamentally different way
Brainstorming enough without deep knowledge development would need particular domain understand issue break away existing way What study introduce alternative measure breakthrough focused knowledge breakthrough opposed economic value measured number time patent would cited
And interesting prior study always assumed got high level citation idea novel
And said Because idea novel get citation therefore breakthrough What found study fact patent get highly cited necessarily novel truly novel language standpoint knowledge standpoint breaking new ground knowledge space
And break set assumption people made novelty automatically lead high level citation
And able show different creative process lead novelty lead generating citation
That really surprising part finding assumption field making direct connection novelty citation neatly linked people assumed
When think organization trying promote innovation typically recommended try create process bring together distant diverse knowledge
So hear lot lot research diverse team know bringing marketing R D engineering different group together generate innovation
And clearly important finding research also need different process allow deep dive one knowledge space
So thinking R D organization mean really valuing R part R D research part say going really dive deeply area even know specifically product might service might understand area deeply enough order able identify key problem challenge anomaly field
Once insight coming together process combining different idea make lot sense
But go straight combination diverse team may missing highest impact idea done I consider allows insight innovation
This corrects misperception held organization public medium creativity always brainstorming among diverse team like
But finding also need deep dive information get novel idea
This connects idea people read
Kuhn work scientific paradigm talk change paradigm break paradigm really require deep dive
And able study contrast creative process around combination creative process around deep dive knowledge
What found study fact patent get highly cited necessarily There two thing set research apart analysis
One methodology
I mentioned used computer science technique called topic Topic modeling technique developed improve search algorithm
For example going search engine want put term get search result
Topic modeling developed help u improve search result getting result want
We took technique said You know topic modeling really take call bag word body text case study body text text patent looking infers body text different word key underlying topic data This interesting time social science want categorize theme topic come analyst topic look text look product look whatever categorizing
What nice computer science technique allows word speak tell u category without u impose frame reference data
We identify topic body text patent studied could identify patent source patent new topic
So topic emerged field see patent actual source idea
That methodologically important contribution
It first paper social science taken topic modeling used statistical regression analysis kind
And part vanguard scholar beginning use computer science technique analyze text understand social science phenomenon new way
The contribution theoretical gone back creativity research found two school thought creativity research
One school thought call tension view view order get creative idea break current way thinking therefore need diverse idea need different way thinking need combine language field recombine idea sort different domain order break u current mental model
It first paper social science taken topic modeling used statistical regression analysis kind All theory around combination diversity based tension view say new knowledge tension old knowledge
But another view creativity go back psychology literature called foundational view
The foundational view say No go deep one domain order see anomaly really break existing way So contribution paper go back insight psychology creativity say Wait minute forgotten half creative We spent time focused combination diversity le time focused deep dive existing field help u produce term breakthrough idea
My project I project looking specific recommendation might able make organization design innovation process looking organization design innovation team structure understand type work best
You need combination experience le experienced researcher need research different domain
We going look team structure also going compare different technological domain nanotechnology particular type innovation process
We going compare process engineering innovation process like looking MRI machine used imaging comparing stem cell biological innovation process
We going look different domain different creative process might play understand type team structure best producing breakthrough novel idea idea highly cited magic novel highly cited way measuring economic value
We got whole project get deeper specific organizational recommendation
That one project I research

Computer forensics integrates field computer science law investigate crime
For digital evidence legally admissible court investigator must follow proper legal procedure recovering analyzing data computer system
Unfortunately law written era computer forensics often outdated adequately ass technique used computer system search
The inability law keep pace technological advancement may ultimately limit use computer forensics evidence court
Privacy advocate growing especially concerned computer search may breach suspect human right
Furthermore method encryption anonymity grow advanced technology may abused helping criminal hide action
Ultimately role technology computer forensics may reach full potential due legal boundary potential malicious intention
Computer forensics indispensable conviction many criminal including terrorist sexual predator murderer
Terrorist organization may use Internet recruit member sexual predator may use social networking site stalk potential victim
However criminal fail cover track using technology implement crime
They fail realize computer file data remain hard drive even deleted allowing investigator track criminal activity
Even criminal delete incriminating file data remains binary format due data remanence residual representation data
File deletion merely renames file hide user original file still recovered
Eventually data may overwritten lost due volatile nature memory storage area used data
A random access memory chip RAM retrieves data memory help program run efficiently
However time computer switched RAM loses stored data
Therefore RAM referred volatile memory data preserved hard drive known persistent memory
The RAM constantly swapping seldom used data hard drive open space memory newer data
Over time though content swap file may also overwritten
Thus investigator may lose evidence longer wait since computer data persist indefinitely
Fortunately computer scientist engineered equipment copy computer content without turning machine
The content safely used lawyer detective analysis
Global Position System GPS software embedded smartphones satellite navigation satnav system also aid prosecutor tracking whereabouts suspect
Since company develop software computer forensics also develop product satellite navigator tool technology necessary acquiring GPS evidence
However evidence recovered GPS software limited list address
Current GPS software record time address archived whether address inputted person automatically recorded whether owner intent entering address associated crime
Despite limitation GPS evidence still crucial success many prosecution
In one famous example four armed suspect accused robbing bank United Kingdom convicted suspect owned vehicle whose satnav held incriminating evidence including bank address address three suspect
The Scottish National Crime Unit searched suspect TomTom GPS device obtain thousand address vehicle passed
Many address turned scene criminal offense
In force successfully found Pakistani compound Osama bin Laden killed tracking satellite phone call made bodyguard
While GPS evidence may enough establish motive GPS evidence still provide invaluable lead confirm hunch
For example contact list language preference setting may used establish suspect identity identify accomplice
Evidence GPS software mobile device valuable supplement form evidence
Some criminal grown cautious hiding incriminating data encryption technique
However according Andy Spruill senior director risk management Guidance Software criminal knowledge patience implement encryption software The minority criminal encrypt file may use partial encryption
If file hard drive encrypted investigator analyze unencrypted copy found elsewhere device find information seeking
Furthermore since computer user tend reuse password investigator locate password easily decipherable format gain access protected file
Computer data also oftentimes redundant Microsoft Word make copy time document modified deleting document may permanently remove hard drive
With many form difficult criminal completely delete incriminating computer evidence
While investigator exploit computer system glitch obtain evidence technological limitation often compromise computer search
A common protocol handling mobile device found crime scene turn power
Investigators want preserve battery prevent outside source using remote wipe feature phone content
When phone turned phone receive text message data may overwrite evidence currently stored device
However turning device consequence potentially causing data lost downloaded file corrupted
To solve problem computer engineer developed technology shielding device connecting cellular carrier network
Computer forensic scientist longer need turn device isolate
For example radio frequency RF shielded test enclosure box help keep signal entering leaving device
A Faraday bag used conjunction conductive mesh also isolate mobile device
Using technique investigator safely transport mobile device lab device turned
However GPS software Faraday bag foolproof
A cell phone isolated Faraday bag may adamantly search signal depleting phone battery power
When searching network cell phone also losing data
Radio frequency bag iPhone inside reducing data loss
These bag keep radio signal entering leaving device

According Professor David Last University Bangor Wales error locating signal may range meter obstruction present
While percent GPS measurement fall within metre true position clear open area large geographical barrier skyscraper may severely block reflect satellite signal
Interference solar weather may also disrupt signal
Criminals even purposely use jammer disrupt tracking system
Investigators must carefully audit communication channel monitoring system used tracking system
In better avoid skepticism jury able give clearer precise estimate amount error afflicting GPS measurement
Otherwise defense suppress GPS evidence measurement significantly faulty unreliable
While Fourth Fifth Amendments written long era computer concept still apply practice computer forensics
The amendment serve protect basic human right preventing unreasonable search seizure
In case defendant claimed cell phone analogous closed container suggesting investigator exercise restraint caution searching cell phone would bag private home
Generally investigator must first obtain search warrant typically given court order obtain preserve evidence easily destroyed
However exception rule observed investigator legally retrieved telephone number finite memory suspect pager without warrant content pager easily altered incoming message overwrite currently stored data
Searches without warrant incident arrest permissible help prevent fragile data evidentiary value lost
They consist mostly scanning device content using keyboard menu option
More advanced search incident arrest may include use mobile lab allows immediate download cellular phone data
However according search incident arrest conducted substantially contemporaneous arrest
If investigator want conduct forensic analysis proper legal authorization must first obtained
Proper legal procedure often vague burdensome investigator especially since law may vary state state
Some state may stricter policy regarding warrantless search
In court ruled since cell phone hold greater quantity data pager content le likely lost warrantless cell phone search thus unnecessary unjustified
Similarly court decided searching information stored cell phone analogous search sealed letter
Even investigator manage obtain search warrant evidence find may still suppressed forensic procedure fail follow legal procedure
For example looking unopened mail unread text carefully documenting chain custody may constitute improper search
With many boundary inconsistency legal system often difficult investigator successfully perform job
Different state national legal system plague computer forensics well
When Estonian charged computer crime Russia refused provide legal cooperation criminalized computer crime yet
Russia received severe Distributed Denial Service attack lack cooperation
In addition faulty legal system accessibility advanced technology may afflicting computer forensics
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO defines cyber terrorism cyber attack using exploiting computer communication network cause sufficient destruction generate fear intimidate society ideological goal As computer system grow powerful criminal may also abuse computer system commit crime software theft terrorism sexual harassment
For example stalker abuse Tor Project anonymizing tool victim cybercrime safely report abuse instead hide identity commit crime harassment
The technology advanced digital trail cybercrime tracked
As encryption program grow stronger popular forensic investigator may longer able decode hidden digital evidence
For computer forensics progress law must keep pace technological advancement
Clear consistent legal procedure regarding computer system search must developed police investigator properly trained
An International Code Ethics Cyber Crime Cyber Terrorism also established develop protocol obtaining preserving evidence maintaining chain custody evidence across border clear ing difference language Following measure may first step resolving technological legal limitation afflicting computer forensics
Interpol International Criminal Police Organization developed Computer Crime Manual training course rapid information exchange system serf foundation international cooperation
Lastly criminal abuse technology limited equipping police department training equipment forensic analysis
Only world safely prepared face future technology
As one author predicts next world war fought bit byte bullet bomb

The scope forensic analysis vary simple reconstructing series event
In book author Kruse Heiser define computer forensics involving preservation identification extraction documentation interpretation computer data
They go describe discipline art science indicating forensic methodology backed flexibility extensive domain knowledge
However several method used extract evidence given computer strategy used law enforcement fairly rigid lack flexibility found civilian world
In court computer forensic evidence subject usual requirement
This requires information authentic reliably obtained admissible
Different country specific guideline practice evidence recovery
In examiner often follow guideline help ensure authenticity integrity evidence
While voluntary guideline widely accepted British court
Computer forensics used evidence since notable example include Computer forensic investigation usually follow standard digital forensic process phase acquisition examination analysis reporting
Investigations performed static data
rather live system
This change early forensic practice lack specialist tool led investigator commonly working live data
A number technique used computer forensics investigation much written many technique used law enforcement particular
When seizing evidence machine still active information stored solely recovered powering may lost
One application live analysis recover RAM data example using Microsoft tool windd prior removing exhibit
CaptureGUARD Gateway bypass Windows login locked computer allowing analysis acquisition physical memory locked computer
RAM analyzed prior content power loss electrical charge stored memory cell take time dissipate effect exploited
The length time data recoverable increased low temperature higher cell voltage
Holding unpowered RAM help preserve residual data order magnitude improving chance successful recovery
However impractical field examination
Some tool needed extract volatile data however require computer forensic lab maintain legitimate chain evidence facilitate work machine
If necessary law enforcement applies technique move live running desktop computer
These include move mouse rapidly small movement prevents computer going sleep accidentally
Usually UPS provides power transit
However one easiest way capture data actually saving RAM data disk
Various file system journaling feature keep large portion RAM data main storage medium operation page file reassembled reconstruct RAM time
A number open source commercial tool exist computer forensics investigation
Typical forensic analysis includes manual review material medium reviewing Windows registry suspect information discovering cracking password keyword search topic related crime extracting picture review

In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
Get FREE access day create account
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain
data warehousing data mining
The former term unstructured collection data latter term analysis
us statistic mathematical tool find pattern information
For information concerning business Internet
known data mining
aim discover significant pattern sequence buying new house followed new dinner table cluster correlation large family van sale decision made
Predictive analytics attempt forecast future outcome based agency employ data mining software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around data warehousing data mining
The former term unstructured collection data latter term analysis often involves collaborative software phase

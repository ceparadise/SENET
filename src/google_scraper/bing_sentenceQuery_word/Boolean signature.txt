In defines input output
A type signature includes number argument type argument order argument contained function
A type signature typically used resolution choosing correct definition function called among many overloaded form
In type signature commonly known
In function example would invoked signature In type signature may optionally declared For example A type signature generally written following format Notice type result regarded everything past first supplied argument
This consequence made possible Haskell support function requires two input one argument supplied function curried produce function argument supplied
Thus calling yield new function called produce
The actual type specification consist actual type general used
So write something like Since Haskell support function passed argument
This written This function take function type signature return data type
In used identify method class level virtual machine code
Example The method represented
The signature method look like And disassembled bytecode take form The method signature method contains three modifier A function signature consists function prototype
It specifies general information function like name scope parameter
Many programming language use order pas along semantic information compiler linkers
In addition mangling excess information function signature stored internally compiler readily available may accessed
Understanding notion function signature important concept computer science study
The practice requires consideration function signature avoid unpredictable result
Computer science theory concept particular make much use concept function signature
In signature roughly equivalent
The term signature may carry meaning computer science
For example In especially commonly identified unique usually includes method name number type order
A method signature smallest method
In method signature method name number type possible last parameter consists array value Manipulation parameter done using routine standard library header
Similar C syntax see method signature name number type parameter last parameter may array value In method signature method name number type order parameter
Return type thrown exception considered part method signature
For example following two method distinct signature The following three method signature considered return value differs
The name parameter part method signature ignored compiler checking method uniqueness
In programming language method signature object declared interface header file
For example defines method return general object take one integer argument
requires type signature explicit type signature equivalent

Boolean refers system logical thought used create statement
A Boolean value express truth value either true false
Boolean expression use operator AND OR XOR NOT compare value return true false result
Boolean logic developed George Boole English mathematician philosopher become basis modern digital computer logic
Because computer operate binary computer logic often represented Boolean term
For example Boolean logic may describe computer circuit state charged true charged false
This describes basic binary concept upon computer processing based
Boolean logic also commonly seen performing Web search search engine

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I define boolean function I think using using plus constant
And I define term
And
So I wondering Why traditionally taught boolean logic using
Is simplest set boolean function used define rest
Or family function equivalent way
Do always need function eg constant define family
Or boolean function argument fundamental appear answer
Or
Or common
If special argument
Is underlying mathematical theory perhaps based symmetry
make kind question easier answer
For example rigorously derive answer question
I know partial answer equivalent family yes I remember De Morgan theorem college far I get
Your main observation correct order able express Boolean function need stick certain set connective
All need defined property
There infinitely many set connective
One example given NOR NAND constant
You probably one ternary connective I let figure
Why taught AND OR NOT
Because familiar useful
It also common define propositional logic using connective IMPLIES NOT
It matter convenience
It also matter convenience usual connective nullary unary binary already ternary connective awkward write functional notation necessary
In general given set connective define set Boolean function definable
Then define concept equivalent set connective
For example XOR NOT equivalent XNOR NOT equivalent NOT
You easily prove two set A B connective equivalent connective A expressed using connective B vice versa
You even define order relation expressing one set connective least expressive another set connective
One relevant mathematical area
For application computer science look modern descendant form active research area
Another connection computer science Reckhow theorem show every formula written using one complete set connective rewritten using set connective furthermore proof complete propositional proof system converted different set connective polynomial blowup

In two value usually denoted intended represent
It named first defined algebraic system logic mid century
The Boolean data type primarily associated statement allow different action change depending whether Boolean evaluates true false
It special case general logic need always Boolean
In Boolean data type usually defined return Boolean value
command may defined test expression
Languages explicit Boolean data type like may still represent truth value data type
us empty list false value true
C us type relational expression like logical expression connected defined value true false whereas test part treat value true
Indeed Boolean variable may regarded implemented numerical variable one binary digit store two value
The implementation Booleans computer likely represented full rather bit usually due way computer transfer block information
Most programming language even explicit Boolean type support Boolean algebraic operation
In language like value belong separate respectively one Boolean
In us explicit comparison special treatment Boolean data type introduced also defined include two truth value SQL store logical value resulting evaluation predicate SQL
A column Boolean type also restricted though
One earliest programming language provide explicit data type value logical operator denoted symbol implies equivalence
Due input device limit many computer time however compiler used alternative representation many operator
This approach either otherwise predefined adopted many later programming language among others
The first version successor FORTRAN II logical value operation even conditional statement took arithmetic expression branched one three location according sign see
FORTRAN IV however followed ALGOL example providing Boolean data type truth literal numeric comparison operator etc
logical operator
In statement specific control character provided parsing formatting logical value
The language never Boolean data type
Instead conditional construct like assume logical value represented empty list defined special atom whereas interpreted
For convenience modern dialect Lisp predefine atom value used mnemonic notation
This approach retained Lisp dialect similar model adopted many even one distinct Boolean type Boolean value although value interpreted vary language language
In Scheme example value atom distinct empty list latter interpreted
The language introduced concept
A data type provided predefined enumerated type value
By definition comparison logical operation conditional statement applied yielded value
Otherwise type facility available enumerated type general ordering use index
In contrast converting integer type still required explicit test function call ALGOL
This approach adopted later language enumerated type
Initial implementation language provided Boolean type day Boolean value commonly represented integer C program
The comparison operator etc
defined return signed integer result either false true
Logical operator etc
statement assume zero false value true
After enumerated type added version C many C programmer got used defining Boolean type readability reason
However enumerated type equivalent integer according language standard effective identity Booleans integer still valid C program
Standard since provides boolean type called
By including header one use intuitive name constant
The language guarantee two true value compare equal impossible achieve introduction type
Boolean value still behave integer stored integer variable used anywhere integer would valid including indexing arithmetic parsing formatting
This approach retained later version separate Boolean data type automatic conversion scalar pointer value similar This approach adopted also many later language especially
also separate Boolean data type possible value equivalent true false respectively
Also compiler support C type used since boolean data type
Instead value behave boolean boolean context condition statement argument etc
The number string empty list special value evaluate false
All else evaluates true
boolean data type value also behave boolean
The evaluate false whereas every data type always evaluates true regardless value
version forward type standard integer type
It two possible value respectively behave arithmetic context
Also numeric value zero integer fractional null value empty empty container
etc
considered Boolean false value considered Boolean true default
Classes define instance treated Boolean context special method Python Python
For container special method determining length container used explicit Boolean conversion method defined
In contrast Ruby null value special object else including integer empty array
In empty string sometimes called distinguish strictly Booleans
Languages also use approach
The standard introduced BOOLEAN data type optional feature
When restricted constraint SQL BOOLEAN behaves like Booleans language
However SQL BOOLEAN type nullable default like SQL data type meaning special value also
Although SQL standard defines three BOOLEAN type TRUE FALSE UNKNOWN also say NULL BOOLEAN UNKNOWN may used interchangeably mean exactly thing
This caused controversy identification subject UNKNOWN equality comparison rule NULL
More precisely UNKNOWN UNKNOWN TRUE
As major SQL system implement feature
notable exception although implement UNKNOWN literal NULL used instead

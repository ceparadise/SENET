If interest computer hardware software sure career path choose probably want learn information technology IT computer science
These two rewarding career require slightly different set skill appeal somewhat different type person
An IT career involves installing organizing maintaining computer system well designing operating network database
Computer science focused entirely efficiently programming computer using mathematical algorithm
An IT career necessarily require computer science CS degree although CS degree open certain door otherwise available
IT professional typically work business environment installing internal network computer system perhaps programming
Computer scientist work wider range environment ranging business university video game design company
Both career excellent growth potential high salary software developer somewhat ahead IT professional earnings
A computer science degree give student rigorous education discrete mathematics computer science theory
Most CS graduate go become software developer Web programmer continue schooling chance research work specialized role advanced artificial intelligence programming
With CS degree student find employment programmer software engineer IT professional
However become software developer graduate usually must teach quite bit programming
A CS education prepares student choose correct design pattern algorithm data structure program student graduate knowing one two programming language usually Python Java
For corporate programming job alone may suffice professional software developer know several language including HTML CSS JavaScript MySQL PHP Python Java
Software developer job projected grow well average
In median annual salary developer percent making least
With IT degree graduate find work number occupation including information security network architecture database administration system administration computer support
However job require advanced computer science programming knowledge graduate must enroll specialized program take elective course
For example information security requires knowledge discrete math algorithm database administration requires knowledge programming
Also information security analyst usually certification ISC CISSP
In general IT professional need stay abreast new technology must familiar use operating system server software including Linux Apache OpenSSL Windows Server Oracle MySQL Microsoft SQL Server
percent next ten year salary ranging depending experience level education
While IT CS degree lead similar job difference two quite pronounced
IT professional enjoy installing computer system using software maintaining network database computer scientist enjoy mathematics software design
In general relationship information technology quite close interdependent

Update Gantt chart project plan summary detail template Project Deliverable Project Plan Inception project task
Running Head Project Introduction Project Introduction NETWORK DESIGN ABC Adventures innovative Company venture capital group funded
Currently company system firm manages information need
At present merely one computer standalone application system experience set problem
Therefore firm hired CIO carry analysis submit project plan upgrade system
Thus aim report accurate carry analysis clearly propose project plan system
The Object report help ABC Adventures remove problem faced help new system
For proper specification new automated information system would developed implemented new system
As Chief Information Officer CIO company I asked The CEO submit plan well within sixty day deliver information technology project plan anticipation company acquiring new system
Since company currently building technology infrastructure support business
All information technology hardware software must implemented either hosted solution solution hybrid model
The CEO expecting integrate different technology different partner incorporate industry best practice connection development technological system
The new facility building
The company currently consists ten employee revenue million expected grow thirty employee revenue million next two year
At moment company involved travel booking using online web based application
Along company plan launch mobile app installed Smartphone mobile device
In mode company wish business always easier convenient standpoint
With company wish NETWORK DESIGN business market survey reveals eCommerce website tends increase number business transaction especially company travel business
The company asked CIO develop innovative plan new application company definite competitive edge application user friendly ergonomically designed
CIO wish propose new plan system advanced term usage modern innovative new technology also advanced design methodology like Rapid application Scrum
It also well known nowadays usually site linked Social site like Facebook Twitter new web design must integrate well site
At time user likely login eCommerce site Facebook credential case remember le number password
So feature accommodated new system design plan
With advent smart way attack security system safe secure design consideration undertaken development
input like personal profile bank related information trip related detail need maintained utmost security privacy
As senior IT Resource person CIO well aware convention database unable support huge data volume data arrives
With lot analytics used company well multiple format data like multimedia format image message many different format data come nowadays CIO advises use Bigdata technology
In effect Hadoop Bigdata open source take care huge amount data handle analytics efficiently
As computing power increasing rapidly lot CPU power Memory harness easily available NETWORK DESIGN possible undertake data analytics provides lot decision making information
This possible Hadoop Big Data technology
The CIO proposes use prototype development Rapid Application development methodology
It possible use Waterfall method conventional way developing system pretty serial
If major change required project stakeholder difficult accommodate everything serialized
Hence scrum development rapid application development enables creation prototype application faster rate
Thus new version would application delivered within week month starting development
This help user system opportunity access application take shape
They get fair idea going get project
So actively participate development providing feedback
This feedback valuable system development context feedback incorporated system development refactoring application
In scrum development user story user view activity taken input design application
The user actually trial attempting hand usage testing development stage
This necessary user give accurate feedback develops confidence new application
Security essential feature context often hear many case fraud cybercrime sabotage attack online application
There many attack using different methodology employed intruder hack system
It therefore safeguard web application attack
A comprehensive thorough approach adapted security feature
The data encrypted even attacker happens steal data use
Apart software plugged NETWORK DESIGN security loophole vulnerability application security patch critical upgrade
This prevent spyware malware attaching eCommerce website
Standard recommended best practice setting network undertaken
This help setting efficient proper network high availability better performance
Packages like CISCO packet tracer used design network
CISCO router used company providing Web server application server host application website
A public domain created site visible publicly
The overall design attempted reduce network latency improve throughput performance
Wireless Linksys router set create network benefit employee Brown University Tutors California Institute Technology Tutors Carnegie Mellon University Tutors Columbia University Tutors Dartmouth University Tutors Emory University Tutors Harvard University Tutors Massachusetts Institute Technology Tutors New York University Tutors Notre Dam University Tutors Oklahoma University Tutors Pennsylvania State University Tutors Princeton University Tutors Stanford University Tutors University California Tutors Oxford University Tutors Yale University Tutors Enter email address associated account email link reset password

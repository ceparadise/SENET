process establishing maintaining consistency product performance functional physical attribute requirement design operational information throughout life
The CM process widely used military organization manage change throughout system
Outside military CM process also used IT service management defined segment
CM applied life cycle system provides visibility control performance functional physical attribute
CM verifies system performs intended identified documented sufficient detail support projected life cycle
The CM process facilitates orderly management system information system change beneficial purpose revise capability improve performance reliability maintainability extend life reduce cost reduce risk liability correct defect
The relatively minimal cost implementing CM returned many fold cost avoidance
The lack CM ineffectual implementation expensive sometimes catastrophic consequence failure equipment loss life
CM emphasizes functional relation part subsystem system effectively controlling system change
It help verify proposed change systematically considered minimize adverse effect
Changes system proposed evaluated implemented using standardized systematic approach ensures consistency proposed change evaluated term anticipated impact entire system
CM verifies change carried prescribed documentation item system reflects true configuration
A complete CM program includes provision storing tracking updating system information component subsystem system basis
A structured CM program ensures documentation requirement design test acceptance documentation item accurate consistent actual physical design item
In many case without CM documentation exists consistent item
For reason engineer contractor management frequently forced develop documentation reflecting actual status item proceed change
This process wasteful term human resource minimized eliminated using CM
Configuration Management originated technical management discipline hardware material standard practice virtually every industry
The CM process became technical discipline sometime late DoD developed series called series subsequently issued
In series consolidated single standard known replaced pursuant general DoD goal reduced number military standard favor industry supported SDO
This marked beginning evolved widely distributed accepted standard CM
Now widely adopted numerous organization agency CM discipline concept include SE ILS CMMI project management method ITIL
Many function model redefined CM traditional holistic approach technical management
Some treat CM similar librarian activity break change control change management separate stand alone discipline
CM practice handling change systematically maintains time
CM implement policy procedure technique tool manage evaluate proposed change track status change maintain inventory system support document system change
CM program plan provide technical administrative direction development implementation procedure function service tool process resource required successfully develop
During system development CM allows track requirement throughout acceptance operation maintenance
As change inevitably occur requirement design must approved documented creating accurate record system status
Ideally CM process applied throughout
Most professional mix get confused AM inventory asset hand
The key difference CM AM former manage financial accounting aspect
The CM process item comprises five distinct discipline established
These discipline carried policy procedure establishing performing standard process
The process also activity add Release management delivery
The five discipline The traditional software configuration management SCM process looked upon practitioner best solution handling change software project
It identifies functional physical attribute software various point time performs systematic control change identified attribute purpose maintaining software integrity traceability throughout software development life cycle
The SCM process defines need trace change ability verify final delivered software planned enhancement supposed included release
It identifies four procedure must defined software project ensure sound SCM process implemented
They These term definition change standard standard essentially
The ITIL specifies use Configuration management system CMS CMDB mean achieving industry best practice Configuration Management
CMDBs used track Configuration Items CIs dependency CIs represent thing enterprise worth tracking managing limited computer software software license rack network device storage even component within item
The benefit includes able perform function like root cause analysis impact analysis change management current state assessment future state strategy development
Example system commonly identifies system include
For CM defined management security feature assurance control change made hardware software firmware documentation test test fixture test documentation throughout life cycle information system
CM information assurance sometimes referred ecure onfiguration anagement relies upon performance functional physical attribute IT platform product environment determine appropriate security feature assurance used measure system configuration state
For example configuration requirement may different function part organization Internet boundary versus one function internal local
Configuration management used maintain understanding status complex asset view maintaining highest level serviceability lowest cost
Specifically aim ensure operation disrupted due asset part asset overrunning limit planned lifespan quality level
In military type activity often classed mission readiness seek define asset available type mission classic example whether aircraft board aircraft carrier equipped bomb ground support missile defense
Configuration management used maintain configuration file
Example system include
Many system utilize define maintain configuration
A theory configuration maintenance worked practical implementation present day computer system software able perform real time repair well preventive maintenance
Understanding state asset major component essential element preventive maintenance used maintenance repair overhaul system
Complex asset aircraft ship industrial machinery etc
depend many different component serviceable
This serviceability often defined term amount usage component since new since fitted since repaired amount use life several limiting factor
Understanding near end life component major undertaking involving record keeping recent development software
Many type component use electronic sensor capture data provides live
This data analyzed board remote location computer evaluate current serviceability increasingly likely future state using algorithm predict potential future failure based previous example failure field experience modeling
This basis predictive maintenance
Availability accurate timely data essential order CM provide operational value lack often limiting factor
Capturing disseminating operating data various support organization becoming industry
The consumer data grown numerous complex growth program offered original equipment manufacturer OEMs
These designed offer operator guaranteed availability make picture complex operator managing asset OEM taking liability ensure serviceability
A number standard support include configuration management including More recently configuration management applied large construction project often complex huge amount detail change need documented
Construction agency Federal Highway Administration used configuration management infrastructure project
There configuration management tool aim document change order RFIs order ensure project stay schedule budget
These program also store information aid maintenance modification infrastructure completed
One application ccsNet tested case study funded Federal Transportation Administration FTA efficacy configuration management measured comparing approximately complete construction Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency LACMTA segment Red Line billion rail construction project
This study yielded result indicating benefit using configuration management project nature

Each element IT environment individual entity requiring accurate capture attribute
The representation entity CMDB CIs
A CI software model contains attribute represented entity
In database described schema
Each entity consists several attribute specific data type example string integer
Each instance entity CI example identical server equal CIs schema independent instance unique attribute setting
A CI real tangible example hardware software code logical abstraction example business process distributed application
If examine Windows server Cisco router subset overall environment represents least CIs
We say least possible indeed likely device built device
For example Cisco router may consist chassis multiple card within chassis
It possible treat entire router one CI make sense also break CIs granular level
We explain later book short reason enables flexible abstraction model constructed manipulated
The concept CI must extensible
Some believe CI atomic level CI also complex assembly CIs
In server example physical server special attribute
A virtual server also special attribute unique virtual instance even though resident physical server
This relationship two mean share certain attribute also contain attribute unique perspective
Applications business service customer organization also CIs see even higher level CI hierarchy
Similar relationship link various layer reflect reality
To accurately capture maintain atomic detail well relationship CMS CMDBs built upon traditional relational database model well myriad format include text file Simple Network Management Protocol Management Information Bases SNMP MIBs software Application Programming Interfaces APIs
The technology especially important continued development Configuration Management information
We cover technology detail Chapter
Example Configuration Items Each CI several attribute associated
Some compound abstraction refer number CIs Department CI consists several Employee CIs
By simply viewing CIs individual item difficult envision various CIs interact form something useful
We need link correct object attribute creating appropriate relationship shown dark black line
Relationships among CIs Here CIs linked expand appropriate attribute becomes easier navigate map CIs impact upon overall service
The link established many way relational database table reference Java class pointer
When talk relationship CMDB link best implemented XML
We explain relationship link detail Chapter Chapter No Way Around It In example also see common data across CIs
Good database administrator try normalize data eliminate possibility data overlap
With distributed object normalization bit difficult
In particular case possible specific attribute might linked Asset Management database yet another CI
You see many reference relationship many find repetition annoying
We relentlessly preach relationship reason
They indeed glue bind everything together result information meaningful
Without adequately capturing relationship CMDB crumbles worthless disarray
A CI small morsel data complex multilayered composite CIs composite level
This flexibility essential smooth Configuration Management process
Do limit perspective CI infrastructure device
Such myopic perspective make system CMDBs inflexible fragile even complex model
This one aspect discipline lack thereof noted Chapter The Need Process The future operation placed jeopardy deleterious factor exist
Many element IT business environment qualify CIs describe Chapter CMS Deployment Ideally every identifiable unit importance captured CMDB realistically driven business service need bound priority staffing technology capability
Exactly CIs incorporate order determined factor
Existing technology offer plenty information help
In Chapter cover data leveraged
Configuration item fall many domain discussed following section yet detail Chapter
When people think CMDB usually limit perspective infrastructure element server router storage
This myopic view rationale behind mode thinking understandable
Throughout much history IT called CMDB known various term common asset database
This view persists today even though CMDB contains far infrastructure element
Such database used maintain record individual hardware asset owned enterprise
Advanced organization expanded asset database include software also
An asset database represents limited subset CMDB important one
It often initial phase CMDB journey historical view fact much data already collected
Infrastructure closely associated hardware device environment
For device many attribute identified collected maintained
show common attribute CI representing server
A server CI attribute Even simple server CI see attribute raise additional question
Attributes manufacturer model straightforward CPU architecture operating system
CPU architecture could Intel SPARC open unique twist basic server definition
The operating system could Windows Server Red Hat Enterprise Linux VMware ESX even something like OpenVMS
Each attribute requires detail detail may unique Windows totally irrelevant Linux example
Where extension needed OO technology link relevant extended attribute
This raise interesting debate precisely constitutes infrastructure
Traditional example infrastructure network device hub switch server storage including disk drive SAN hardware mainframe
This typically consider hardware
As continue embed sophisticated intelligence hardware line infrastructure application becomes blurred
Virtually every single piece today hardware complex mixture genuine hardware example silicon steel plastic software example operating system BIOS microcode embedded web server
For sake CMDB discussion consider infrastructure package hardware embedded software
Infrastructure hardware software
Software infrastructure differs application describe next section
This sometimes called system software software infrastructure extends beyond traditional system software Linux VMware element support application Tibco JBoss
Although software recommend infrastructure include software element well traditional hardware
Infrastructure longer limited tangible hardware component require electron
The basic intelligence manipulates electron also count infrastructure
The structural behavioral aspect certain attribute morph time
Virtual server good example
Whereas server supported single operating system support many
The operating system attribute must abstracted link multiple possible virtual operating system instance virtual machine VM particular physical server
To complicate matter even relationship physical virtual server highly dynamic example VMware VMotion software easily shuffle VM one physical server another
Your CMDB plan architecture technology operation must flexible enough address frequently shifting requirement
This major reason technology becoming popular CMDB
An OO approach enables adapt data structure changing demand
IT system irreversibly becoming dynamic
The gaining popularity mark acceleration dynamic system plateau
Applications software element directly touched felt end user
Examples include Microsoft Exchange Siebel custom system
Products like SAP Microsoft Internet Explorer Adobe Flash Player also seen application getting domain software infrastructure pointed section infrastructure CIs
What deem application software infrastructure consistent within context CMDB
As build model find many application abstraction built upon application
The gray line application software infrastructure situation occur
Some application used end user database may become software infrastructure another complex application example shipping application built top SAP using database
The value clarifying demarcation application software infrastructure come using CMDB sophisticated purpose
We cover purpose detail Chapter present simple example deeply desired also extremely difficult achieve
Consider exercise identifying root cause application performance anomaly
The application consists many software hardware component first thing need understand structure application relationship element see
The hierarchy relationship map multiple tier typical modern business application
Example tiered application structural relationship To determine root cause structure navigated component impact overall application behavior assessed
This assessment first capitalizes relationship bind various component together form path followed navigation
They give u visibility potential mapping significantly narrow field possibility
The performance availability configuration state component analyzed
The mapping significantly reduces set possible root cause including element truly matter application question
By narrowing scope attack problem effectively
Of course would wonderful could automate analysis end remains dream
This difficulty arises application analysis topic another book
In Chapter offer guidance work conjunction Change Management process
In chapter also show change point many root cause myriad problem including elusive application performance problem
It begin accurate configuration data like call truth
You must also forget Continual Service Improvement component ITIL describe Chapter Continual Improvement There condition Incident Problem Management called
A known error incident problem whose diagnosis complete whose final resolution either delayed implemented temporary fix
As incident arise known error root cause operation staff able quickly identify known error take appropriate action
Actions include proper notification affected user possibly implementing solution
As operation gain experience known error tied resolution
This form linkage accelerates resolution
The error detected resolution immediately found presented
The responder therefore map guide speedy service restoration
One important management aspect known error need capture maintain throughout lifecycles including
To enable known error database maintained
Many common Service Desk product include form known error database
Service Desk staff developed need database purpose mention front line IT organization
Vendors Service Desk automation software responded need full inclusion known error database supplying optional module
Naturally known error database represents yet another family CIs CMDB
The value class CIs help streamline many daily function incident analysis pattern analysis Problem Management capacity planning continuous improvement
The known error related infrastructure application class CIs
These relationship need captured mapped known error attribute host CIs
The known error attribute subject change multiple known error single host CI could dependent example particular environment configuration architecture object model must support set similar relationship attribute
If application abstraction infrastructure next step application business service level
Like application multiple layer business service example product ordering service component broader supply chain automation service
At highest level structure business process
Chapter Chapter The Future CMS figure demonstrate notion business service sitting atop remaining IT structure
Business process modeling functional domain unto within IT community
It one tightest integration point IT business increasingly owned controlled business side rather IT side
Unfortunately CMDB CMS vendor yet offer complete solution automate discovery service without significant human intervention
The current state still much silo oriented changing
You work business community Enterprise Architecture organization incorporate business process information
Stay date standard developed Business Modeling Integration Domain Task Force prepared input work easily vendor tool tool come along
All party benefit
Newer development making much easier standard object modeling integration technology gaining acceptance
Standards development decade
Standards took positive turn Business Process Modeling Initiative BPMI merged Object Management Group OMG form Business Modeling Integration Domain Task Force BMI
BMI OMG responsible standard OASIS others still others
The flexibility offered XML allows many derivative developed
That good part standard
The downside allows many derivative developed
You easily become overwhelmed plethora standard available
As pursue CMDB role selection specific standard limited
You leave painful selection Enterprise Architecture team responsibility anyway highly recommend collaborate team help determine optimum path linking business process standard CMDB
Chapter provides basis discussion federated structure architecture group
Much discussion taking place Business Service Management BSM aspect IT produce manage technology eye business much eye technologist
The business process business service feed linkage core IT infrastructure application actual business value
The relationship within tier enable u determine business impact server failure example
Without relationship assessing business impact mere often wrong
Accurately understanding business impact via CMDB use case absolutely essential want position IT organization valued business partner
Just function IT CMDB fundamental supporting pillar BSM
Business process element CMDB aforementioned misconception CMDB infrastructure
The omission business process exacerbates u division IT business
Inclusion business process ensures business relevance CMDB enables use case value business service management effort
The result help change language u u unified journey toward business execution excellence
Human being important element business
IT service different
You colleague end user reporting structure direction vendor partner many many others contribute technology business service
How people fit overall picture requirement good CMDB
People identified tracked used managed according individual contribution responsibility
Here attribute people useful The identity authorization must intertwined
Companies using identity management product work conjunction product using AAA protocol related technology understand manage enforce access control control privilege authorization policy
When management software function executed must ensure action allowed example Can I change OSPF parameter router Can view schema HR database
Proprietary isolated mechanism support action managing dizzying array mapping without automation technology intractable
Here lie solution dilemma one already starting take root IT organization
Configuration Change Management CCM product highlight good example bringing sanity tedious task manual configuration change execution
The tool manages common AAA mechanism covered element tool executing change
The disparate access control managed centrally common tool
Logically CCM tool strong CMDB heart tool sufficiently understand configuration acting upon various policy regarding action
The result common platform normalizing task execution faster trustworthy yet benefit CMDB effort
CCM tool include CMDB valuable element overall CMDB architecture
By virtue basic function almost always discovery covered domain usually effectively discovery tool domain many
This mean data highly accurate
As build wider CMS tool effective CMDBs individual domain
By assigning authorization role tool drive action simplified
Instead managing authorization individual manage role
The system role people assigned role
Roles institute additional layer structure human CIs additional layer well worth minimal overhead operational simplicity mentioned
As known error CIs many others model requires flexibility support many role per person
Here relationship least one role probably
The human CIs certainly included bigger CMDB structure CMS precise
You need indeed create CMDB scratch
Leverage already exists data source full excellent data people
It called HR database often embedded within software tool used HR function Peoplesoft
In showed CI called Employee
The populated Employee CIs attribute extracted HR database requiring little additional embellishment CMDB purpose
You need lot detail existing HR database give anyway
although basic identity information example employee number name department number title reporting structure exist handy available
Finally present another class CI often overlooked despite repeated reference formal ITIL position CMDB CMS
That class documentation
Together known error source embody call
We view valid categorization
Documents different data type normally maintained CMDB relational database
They file PDF Excel
The document CI core attribute path name preferably URL point document file
The host CI infrastructure application point document CI appropriate
If need see installation instruction Dell server attribute installation guide document CI set specific PDF document Dell web site internal copy likely better idea
The UML diagram Order Cash business process PDF link included attribute business process CI Order Cash

All computer software built set instruction
Instructions encoded binary
The cycle sequence step CPU follows process instruction
Software program set instruction
For execute instruction one must first translated simple code activate part CPU
The CPU performs basic function A piece software game combine function perform complex task
The carry calculation make decision data sent processor
The CU also called controller control data moving processor control timing operation instruction sent processor
The CU directs system carry program instruction
It fetching decoding managing instruction
also called internal memory immediate access memory store
A register small amount fast temporary memory within processor ALU CU store change value needed execute instruction
Different processor different set register
One important register
This keep track running order instruction show instruction program due executed next

In single operation defined processor
The size length instruction varies widely little many multiple VLIW system
Most modern processor used instruction size bit
In architecture especially instruction fixed length typically corresponding architecture
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifying operation performed add content memory register zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous operation operand specified single instruction
Instructions rarely specified using form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
There another general definition instruction related processor An instruction may representation element executable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I think store address current instruction
And instruction completed program counter incremented get next instruction
But question increment program counter
It would mean increment address work
Assuming architecture alignment instruction word every instruction composed byte
That implies bottom two bit address byte offset within word address denotes byte word
When talking instruction however never need fetch individual byte want whole word
Different textbook handle program counter differently given whichever paradigm using program counter incremented rather lead believe PC store address rather byte address
Then program counter increment fact get
To turn address byte address fetch instruction memory simply
In short program counter address address instruction actually fetching
To fetch next instruction increment program counter

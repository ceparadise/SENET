In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

That time required solve problem using currently known increase quickly size problem grows
As consequence determining whether possible solve problem quickly called one principal today
While method computing solution problem using reasonable amount time remains undiscovered still frequently encounter problem
problem often addressed using method
problem set whose solution verified polynomial time may equivalently defined set decision problem solved polynomial time
A problem NP every problem NP transformed reduced polynomial time
problem studied ability quickly verify solution problem NP seems correlate ability quickly solve problem
It known whether every problem NP quickly called
But solved quickly definition problem state every problem NP must quickly reducible every problem reduced polynomial time
Because often said problem NP problem general
A decision problem shown NP demonstrating candidate solution verified polynomial time
Note problem satisfying condition said whether satisfies condition
A consequence definition polynomial time algorithm could solve problem NP polynomial time
The concept introduced see though term introduced later
At conference fierce debate among computer scientist whether problem could solved polynomial time

In definition given term used technical meaning
Another type reduction Turing reduction
A problem problem given subroutine solves polynomial time one could write program call subroutine solves polynomial time
This contrast reducibility restriction program call subroutine return value subroutine must return value program
If one defines analogue Turing reduction instead reduction resulting set problem wo smaller open question whether larger
Another type reduction also often used define reduction computed logarithmic amount space
Since every computation done also done polynomial time follows reduction also reduction
This type reduction refined usual reduction allows u distinguish class
Whether type reduction definition change still open problem

Propositional logic good vehicle introduce basic property logic
It provide mean determine validity truth false atomic statement
Instead allows evaluate validity compound statement given validity atomic component
For example consider following Accept fact first two statement noting use exclusive thus could really thought saying I like Pat I like Joe I like
Do statement imply I like Joe true
Try convince I like Joe true consider another line reasoning We see answer case
The two set statement abstracted follows Here concerned logical reasoning statement
Thus instead working pig Pats simply write We begin study first syntax propositional logic describe element language logic written
We describe semantics symbol symbol mean
The syntax propositional logic composed propositional symbol logical connective parenthesis
Rules govern element written together
First treat propositional symbol merely set symbol purpose use letter Roman Greek alphabet refer set symbol Second logical connective Note minimal required set equivalently represented using single connective NOR NAND used lowest level computer hardware
Finally use parenthesis denote expression later make parenthesis optional An string propositional symbol parenthesis logical connective
The expression consider called
The set formula smallest set expression Another way define formula language defined following grammar start symbol The context free grammar unambiguous
The function formula create meaning statement given meaning atomic statement
The semantics formula propositional symbol mapping associating truth assignment truth value
The truth value used instead respectively well abbreviation
The semantics well defined due Fact seen
One way specify semantics logical connective via truth table Can one always find formula implement given semantics
Yes truth table realized formula
The formula found follows
Represent row conjunction true proposition symbol negation false one
Finally write disjunction result
For example Every formula equivalent disjunction conjunction propositional symbol negation propositional symbol
Dual DNF
To get CNF There case DNF resp
CNF exponentially larger original formula
For example equivalent DNF exponential size
Does truth table polynomial size formula implementing
More precisely exist every truth table propositional symbol form size
Answer
Assume exists
The number truth table propositional symbol
The number formula size propositional symbol connective parenthesis
Clearly sufficiently large
TODO exposition explain definition provide context Note



It also possible prove directly
Special case SAT polynomial time
Example A disjunction literal one positive
There two kind possible Horn clause For every set Horn formula checking whether satisfiable
Let subset containing clause type subset containing clause type
Note first satisfiable
To obtain minimum satisfying assignment start literal clause crank rule
It remains check consistency clause
To enough check clause true
Consider set Horn clause The set clause type consists first clause consists last clause
Note also written The minimum satisfying assignment obtained follows Thus minimum satisfying assignment make true
This contradicts state must false
Thus satisfiable
A system mechanism proving new statement given statement
Let set known valid statement propositional formula
In deductive system two component inference rule proof
If proof using inference rule write
Natural deduction collection inference rule
Let denote contradiction falsity
The following inference rule natural deduction Rule allows u prove valid statement form If even know truth value statement set known valid statement
Indeed rule start assuming valid
If conclude valid world valid conclude relation true release assumption valid
We show apply inference rule
Example De Morgan Law negated say By rule prove infer desired result
To prove first direction use rule assume hypothesis
Then We prove second direction
Proof Pierce Law Natural deduction sound
To show natural deduction also complete need introduce propositional resolution
Resolution another procedure checking validity statement
It involves single rule
Some terminology A proof system resolution contains single resolution rule resolvent defined follows
Assume clause The smallest set clause containing closed resolution denoted
If
It possible show resolution rule defined computes clause inferred using natural deduction
Let two clause
Then
In order prove validity statement prove statement unsatisfiable
To prove unsatisfiability formula need define formula The resolution refutation tree formula tree rooted empty clause every leaf clause internal node computed resolvent two corresponding child
Notice clause appear repeated leaf
From claim conclude If exists resolution refutation tree formula unsatisfiable
The formula following resolution refutation tree The order clause selected compute resolvent matter computing resolution refutation tree following example show Consider formula Even though resolution refutation tree may exist order important trying build tree
Below two different resolution refutation tree one successful Propositional resolution sound exists resolution refutation tree given formula must unsatisfiable
For formula
Propositional resolution complete given formula unsatisfiable resolution refutation tree
For formula
By induction number variable
We one variable say
All possible clause
If unsatisfiable clause occur therefore
Suppose hypothesis true formula le variable
Let formula variable
Suppose show satisfiable
Let variable
Then either hold immediately
Assume
We define formula containing clause contain literal removed clause word equivalent formula resulting setting true
Formally First notice thus Also since
By induction hypothesis satisfiable
Then satisfiable extension satisfying assignment equal true
The case analogous
Let set inference rule Natural Deduction
If
The idea behind proof completeness natural deduction follows
Suppose valid unsatisfiable
We show exists resolution refutation applying contradiction rule rule conclude inferred
Sketch Given formula valid perform following step Step easily done repeated application De Morgan law
Step proven using natural deduction
Finally step proven induction number step obtain
Clearly step simulated using natural deduction
It likely algorithm propositional resolution take long worst case recall checking validity formula complete
Linear resolution particular resolution strategy always resolve recent resolvent clause
The resolution refutation tree obtained therefore linear
It possible prove set clause Horn clause exists linear resolution strategy formula
That linear resolution complete set Horn clause
The language PROLOG us resolution set Horn clause
Each clause called
Moreover clause composed single literal called
A clause single negated literal called
The table show comparison different notation
In PROLOG query statement idea negate statement perform resolution set known true statement
If resolution refutation tree found statement implied program
An example linear resolution formula shown

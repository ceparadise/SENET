What Monte Carlo method
In general term Monte Carlo method Monte Carlo simulation used describe technique approximates solution quantitative problem statistical sampling
As used Carlo simulation specifically used describe method propagating translating uncertainty model input uncertainty model output result
Hence type simulation explicitly quantitatively represents uncertainty
Monte Carlo simulation relies process explicitly representing uncertainty specifying input
If input describing system uncertain prediction future performance necessarily uncertain
That result analysis based input represented probability distribution probability distribution
Whereas result single simulation uncertain system build dam salmon population could go extinct result probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation build dam chance salmon population go extinct
Such result case quantifying risk extinction typically much useful utilize simulation result
In order compute probability distribution predicted performance necessary translate input uncertainty uncertainty result
A variety method exist propagating uncertainty
Monte Carlo simulation perhaps common technique propagating uncertainty various aspect system predicted performance
In Monte Carlo simulation entire system simulated large number time
Each simulation equally likely referred system
For realization uncertain parameter sampled single random value selected specified distribution describing parameter
The system simulated time given particular set input parameter performance system computed
This result large number separate independent result representing possible future system one possible path system may follow time
The result independent system realization assembled probability distribution possible outcome
As result output single value probability distribution
As simple example Monte Carlo simulation consider calculating probability particular sum throw two dice die value one six
In particular case combination dice roll Based manually compute probability particular outcome
For example six different way dice could sum seven
Hence probability rolling seven equal divided
Instead computing probability way however could instead throw dice hundred time record many time outcome occurs
If dice totaled seven time roll would conclude probability rolling seven approximately
Obviously time rolled dice le approximate result would
Better rolling dice hundred time easily use computer simulate rolling dice time
Because know probability particular outcome one die six number simple
The output realization using GoldSim software The accuracy Monte Carlo simulation function number realization

You build model intuitive manner literally drawing picture influence diagram system
GoldSim flexible easy use Monte Carlo simulation tool allowing represent uncertainty propagating translating uncertainty model input uncertainty model output result
Although GoldSim used static real power also allowing evaluate system evolve time predict future behavior
As GoldSim powerful feature representing process rainfall demand random event accident failure

Values around likely likely occur
Variables could described triangular distribution include past sale history per unit time inventory level
The user defines minimum likely maximum value like triangular distribution
Values around likely likely occur
However value likely extreme likely occur triangular extreme emphasized
An example use PERT distribution describe duration task project management model
The user defines specific value may occur likelihood
An example might result lawsuit chance positive verdict change negative verdict chance settlement chance mistrial

Probabilistic formulation lead definition model space
This probability distribution combine information new information obtained measuring observable parameter data

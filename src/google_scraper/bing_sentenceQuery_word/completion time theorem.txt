NOTE I asked mathstackexchange get response I wanted thought I post CS
Sorry something wrong newbie
State asymptotic worstcase runtime found master theorem
If master theorem apply state T n T T n n T n For first one I think master theorem apply I enough show I ca use master theorem
For second one I know k complexity would O n I know someone show
Can guy verify whether answer hold true possible show deal possible using master theorem
For try thinking problem without using Master Theorem
Try plugging value see get
That would much instructive checking whether theorem applies even question asks stupid question sense since teach formulaic thinking instead open thinking
For Master Theorem applies additive term form perhaps general form one seen class case try show instead Master Theorem applies well
Use fact f n exist b N n N f n

branch focus classifying according inherent difficulty relating
A computational problem understood task principle amenable solved computer equivalent stating problem may solved mechanical application mathematical step
A problem regarded inherently difficult solution requires significant resource whatever algorithm used
The theory formalizes intuition introducing mathematical study problem quantifying amount resource needed solve time storage
Other measure also used amount communication used number circuit used number processor used
One role computational complexity theory determine practical limit computer
Closely related field theoretical computer science
A key distinction analysis algorithm computational complexity theory former devoted analyzing amount resource needed particular algorithm solve problem whereas latter asks general question possible algorithm could used solve problem
More precisely computational complexity theory try classify problem solved appropriately restricted resource
In turn imposing restriction available resource distinguishes computational complexity computability theory latter theory asks kind problem principle solved algorithmically
A viewed infinite collection together every instance
The input string computational problem referred problem instance confused problem
In computational complexity theory problem refers abstract question solved
In contrast instance problem rather concrete utterance serve input decision problem
For example consider problem
The instance number
solution yes number prime otherwise case
Stated another way particular input problem output corresponding given input
To highlight difference problem instance consider following instance decision version Is route kilometre passing Germany largest city
The quantitative answer particular problem instance little use solving instance problem asking round trip site whose total length km
For reason complexity theory address computational problem particular problem instance
When considering computational problem problem instance
Usually alphabet taken binary alphabet set thus string
As mathematical object bitstrings must suitably encoded
For example represented encoded directly via encoding binary
Even though proof theorem regularly assume concrete choice input encoding one try keep discussion abstract enough independent choice encoding
This achieved ensuring different representation transformed efficiently
one central object study computational complexity theory
A decision problem special type computational problem whose answer either alternately either
A decision problem viewed member language instance whose output yes instance whose output
The objective decide aid whether given input string member formal language consideration
If algorithm deciding problem return answer algorithm said accept input string otherwise said reject input
An example decision problem following
The input arbitrary
The problem consists deciding whether given graph
The formal language associated decision problem set connected course obtain precise definition language one decide graph encoded binary string
A computational problem single output expected every input output complex yes
Notable example include
It tempting think notion function problem much richer notion decision problem
However really case since function problem recast decision problem
For example multiplication two integer expressed set triple relation hold
Deciding whether given triple member set corresponds solving problem multiplying two number
To measure difficulty solving computational problem one may wish see much time best algorithm requires solve problem
However running time may general depend instance
In particular larger instance require time solve
Thus time required solve problem space required measure complexity calculated function size instance
This usually taken size input bit
Complexity theory interested algorithm scale increase input size
For instance problem finding whether graph connected much time take solve problem graph vertex compared time taken graph vertex
If input size time taken expressed function
Since time taken different input size different time complexity T defined maximum time taken input size
If T polynomial algorithm said algorithm
say problem solved feasible amount resource admits polynomial time algorithm
A Turing machine mathematical model general computing machine
It theoretical device manipulates symbol contained strip tape
Turing machine intended practical computing technology rather thought experiment representing computing advanced supercomputer mathematician pencil paper
It believed problem solved algorithm exists Turing machine solves problem
Indeed statement
Furthermore known everything computed model computation known u today programming language computed Turing machine
Since Turing machine easy analyze mathematically believed powerful model computation Turing machine commonly used model complexity theory
Many type Turing machine used define complexity class
They equally powerful principle resource time space bounded may powerful others
A deterministic Turing machine basic Turing machine us fixed set rule determine future action
A probabilistic Turing machine deterministic Turing machine extra supply random bit
The ability make probabilistic decision often help algorithm solve problem efficiently
Algorithms use random bit called
A Turing machine deterministic Turing machine added feature allows Turing machine multiple possible future action given state
One way view Turing machine branch many possible computational path step solves problem branch said solved problem
Clearly model meant physically realizable model theoretically interesting abstract machine give rise particularly interesting complexity class
For example see
Many machine model different standard proposed literature example
Perhaps surprisingly model converted another without providing extra computational power
The time memory consumption alternate model may vary
What model common machine operate
However computational problem easier analyze term unusual resource
For example Turing machine computational model allowed branch check many different possibility
The Turing machine little physically want compute algorithm branching exactly capture many mathematical model want analyze important resource analyzing computational problem
For precise definition mean solve problem using given amount time space computational model used
The deterministic Turing machine input total number state transition step machine make halt output answer yes
A Turing machine said operate within time time required input length
A decision problem solved time exists Turing machine operating time solves problem
Since complexity theory interested classifying problem based difficulty one defines set problem based criterion
For instance set problem solvable within time deterministic Turing machine denoted
Analogous definition made space requirement
Although time space complexity resource viewed computational resource
Complexity measure generally defined
Other complexity measure used complexity theory include
The complexity algorithm often expressed using
The complexity refer three different way measuring time complexity complexity measure different input size
Since input size may faster solve others define following complexity For example consider deterministic sorting algorithm
This solves problem sorting list integer given input
The input sorted sorted reverse order algorithm take time case
If assume possible permutation input list equally likely average time taken sorting O log
The best case occurs pivoting divide list half also needing O log time
To classify computation time similar resource space consumption one interested proving upper lower bound minimum amount time required efficient algorithm solving given problem
The complexity algorithm usually taken complexity unless specified otherwise
Analyzing particular algorithm fall field
To show upper bound time complexity problem one need show particular algorithm running time
However proving lower bound much difficult since lower bound make statement possible algorithm solve given problem
The phrase possible algorithm includes algorithm known today algorithm might discovered future
To show lower bound problem requires showing algorithm time complexity lower
Upper lower bound usually stated using hide constant factor smaller term
This make bound independent specific detail computational model used
For instance big O notation one would write O
A set problem related complexity
Simpler complexity class defined following factor Of course complexity class complicated definition fit framework
Thus typical complexity class definition like following But bounding computation time concrete function often yield complexity class depend chosen machine model
For instance language binary string solved Turing machine necessarily requires quadratic time model Turing machine
If allow polynomial variation running time state time complexity two reasonable general model computation polynomially related Chapter
This form basis complexity class set decision problem solvable deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time
The corresponding set function problem
Many important complexity class defined bounding time space used algorithm
Some important complexity class decision problem defined manner following The class necessarily take account space needed represent problem
It turn PSPACE NPSPACE EXPSPACE NEXPSPACE
Other important complexity class include defined using defined using Boolean circuit defined using quantum Turing machine
important complexity class counting problem decision problem
Classes like defined using
class decision problem
For complexity class defined way desirable prove relaxing requirement say computation time indeed defines bigger set problem
In particular although DTIME contained DTIME would interesting know inclusion strict
For time space requirement answer question given time space hierarchy theorem respectively
They called hierarchy theorem induce proper hierarchy class defined constraining respective resource
Thus pair complexity class one properly included
Having deduced proper set inclusion proceed make quantitative statement much additional time space needed order increase number problem solved
More precisely state The state The time space hierarchy theorem form basis separation result complexity class
For instance time hierarchy theorem tell u P strictly contained EXPTIME space hierarchy theorem tell u L strictly contained PSPACE
Many complexity class defined using concept reduction
A reduction transformation one problem another problem
It capture informal notion problem least difficult another problem
For instance problem solved using algorithm difficult say
There many different type reduction based method reduction Cook reduction Karp reduction Levin reduction bound complexity reduction
The commonly used reduction reduction
This mean reduction process take polynomial time
For example problem squaring integer reduced problem multiplying two integer
This mean algorithm multiplying two integer used square integer
Indeed done giving input input multiplication algorithm
Thus see squaring difficult multiplication since squaring reduced multiplication
This motivates concept problem hard complexity class
A problem class problem every problem reduced
Thus problem harder since algorithm allows u solve problem
Of course notion hard problem depends type reduction used
For complexity class larger P reduction commonly used
In particular set problem hard NP set problem
If problem hard said
This mean hardest problem
Since many problem could equally hard one might say one hardest problem
Thus class problem contains difficult problem NP sense one likely Because problem P NP solved able reduce known problem Π another problem Π would indicate known solution Π
This solution Π would yield solution Π
Similarly NP problem reduced set finding problem solved polynomial time would mean P NP
The complexity class P often seen mathematical abstraction modeling computational task admit efficient algorithm
This hypothesis called
The complexity class hand contains many problem people would like solve efficiently efficient algorithm known
Since deterministic Turing machine special Turing machine easily observed problem P also member class NP
The question whether P equal NP one important open question theoretical computer science wide implication solution
If answer yes many important problem shown efficient solution
These include various type problem many problem ability find formal proof theorem
The P versus NP problem one proposed
There US prize resolving problem
It shown Ladner exist problem neither
Such problem called problem
The example problem believed
They NP problem known
The computational problem determining whether two finite
An important unsolved problem complexity theory whether graph isomorphism problem
The answer known believed problem least
If graph isomorphism collapse second level
Since widely believed polynomial hierarchy collapse finite level believed graph isomorphism
The best algorithm problem due run time graph vertex although recent work Babai offer potentially new perspective
The computational problem determining given integer
Phrased decision problem problem deciding whether input prime factor le
No efficient integer factorization algorithm known fact form basis several modern cryptographic system algorithm
The integer factorization problem even UP
If problem polynomial time hierarchy collapse first level equal
The best known algorithm integer factorization take time factor integer
However best known problem run polynomial time
Unfortunately fact say much problem lie respect complexity class
Many known complexity class suspected unequal proved
For instance possible
If equal equal either
Since many known complexity class possible complexity class collapse one class
Proving class unequal would major breakthrough complexity theory
Along line class containing problem
problem answer reversed problem
It believed equal however yet proven
It clear two complexity class equal equal since would also since problem dual
Similarly known set problem solved logarithmic space strictly contained equal
Again many complexity class two known distinct equal class
It suspected equal
However currently open
A problem solved theory
given large finite resource especially time practice solution take many resource useful known
Conversely problem solved practice called literally problem handled
The term literally done sometimes used interchangeably though risk confusion
Tractable problem frequently identified problem solution known
Problems known intractable sense include
If NP P problem also intractable sense
However identification inexact solution large exponent large constant term grows quickly may impractical practical size problem conversely solution grows slowly may practical realistic input solution take long time worst case may take short time case average case thus still practical
Saying problem P imply large case problem hard even
For example decision problem shown P yet algorithm written solve problem reasonable time case
Similarly algorithm solve wide range size le quadratic time routinely handle large instance
To see algorithm generally unusable practice consider program make operation halting
For small say assuming sake example computer operation second program would run year order magnitude
Even much faster computer program would useful small instance sense intractability problem somewhat independent technological progress
However algorithm take operation practical get relatively large
Similarly polynomial time algorithm always practical
If running time say unreasonable consider efficient still useless except small instance
Indeed practice even algorithm often impractical realistic size problem
An early example algorithm complexity analysis running time analysis done
Before actual research explicitly devoted complexity algorithmic problem started numerous foundation laid various researcher
Most influential among definition Turing machine turned robust flexible simplification computer
The beginning systematic study computational complexity attributed seminal paper On Computational Complexity Algorithms laid definition proved hierarchy theorem
In addition suggested consider good algorithm one running time bounded polynomial input size
Earlier paper studying problem solvable Turing machine specific bounded resource include definition Myhill study rudimentary set well paper computation
Somewhat earlier pioneer field USSR studied another specific complexity measure
As remembers However initial interest automaton theory increasingly set aside favor computational complexity exciting fusion combinatorial method inherited conceptual arsenal theory algorithm
These idea occurred earlier I coined term signalizing function nowadays commonly known complexity measure
In developed axiomatic complexity theory based proved important result
The field really began flourish US researcher working independently USSR proved exist practically relevant problem
In took idea leap forward landmark paper Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems showed diverse problem infamous computational intractability

Have ever noticed get direction online usually given estimate long take get
For long trip estimate often based average speed mile per hour mph
But everybody drive mph
Let look way three different people drive let plot location function time
So I got mph reference
Normal Nate average driver
Normal Nate tends sit around mph driving sometimes going sometimes going pretty close
So look location function time pretty close line would going exactly mph
Constant Clara hand drive exactly mph entire way
Late Leo really go anywhere speed really fast get destination
All three Normal Nate Constant Clara Late Leo average mph
This
The average rate change total distance divided total time since three went distance amount time average rate change
Now three average rate change mph
Well instantaneous rate change fast going point time exactly
It speed minute minute
So instantaneous rate change tangent graph
You think velocity single point time
While average rate change three driver mph instantaneous rate change going vary going depend time also driver
Is ever going point Normal Nate going exactly mph
Or Late Leo going exactly mph
Will instantaneous rate change equal average rate change driver
Well answer yes
This
The Mean Value Theorem say function always instantaneous rate change average rate change equal instantaneous rate change somewhere region taken average
Get FREE access day create account
So mean
Let look Normal Nate
Normal Nate averaged mph hour
His average rate change
We find taking total number mile traveled dividing amount time spent
That average rate change
Now couple point travel path going mph exactly
At point tangent position graph equal
So graph position function time going exactly mph three point zero hour
At three point instantaneous rate change equal average rate change
Constant Clara also going mph going mph exactly entire trip instantaneous rate change equal average rate change entire hour
Late Leo also averaged mph got late start
If I look position function time I see going mph beginning trip starting speed closer end trip slowing back
But still hit mph
His instantaneous rate change still mph point along interval
So let recap
The interval like hour equal end point minus start point divided region
So end point minus start point mile divided hour
Our average rate change mph
The slope tangent curve point
It exactly fast going point time
The say average rate change interval equal instantaneous rate change somewhere inside interval
But true always rate change
So true velocity always going defined

two demonstrate inherent limitation every formal containing basic
These result published important mathematical logic
The theorem widely universally interpreted showing find complete consistent set impossible
The first incompleteness theorem state axiom whose theorem listed capable proving truth arithmetic
For formal system always statement natural number true unprovable within system
The second incompleteness theorem extension first show system demonstrate consistency
Employing Gödel incompleteness theorem first several closely related theorem limitation formal system
They followed formal undefinability truth proof Hilbert unsolvable theorem algorithm solve
The incompleteness theorem apply sufficient complexity express basic arithmetic natural number consistent effectively axiomatized concept detailed
Particularly context formal system also called
In general formal system deductive apparatus consists particular set axiom along rule symbolic manipulation rule inference allow derivation new theorem axiom
One example system system variable intended denote natural number
In system sentence formal system express statement natural number
The incompleteness theorem formal provability within system rather provability informal sense
There several property formal system may including completeness consistency existence effective axiomatization
The incompleteness theorem show system contain sufficient amount arithmetic posse three property
A formal system said also called set theorem Franzén
This mean computer program principle could enumerate theorem system without listing statement theorem
Examples effectively generated theory include Peano arithmetic ZFC
The theory known consists true statement standard integer language Peano arithmetic
This theory consistent complete contains sufficient amount arithmetic
However recursively enumerable set axiom thus satisfy hypothesis incompleteness theorem
A set axiom statement axiom language statement negation provable axiom Smith
This notion relevant Gödel first Incompleteness theorem
It confused completeness mean set axiom prof semantic tautology given language
In Gödel proved first order logic complete
But syntactically complete since sentence expressible language first order logic neither proved disproved axiom logic alone example flower pretty
In mere system logic would absurd expect syntactic completeness
But system mathematics thinker Hilbert believed matter time find axiomatization would allow one either prove disprove proving negation every mathematical formula
A formal system might syntactically incomplete design logic generally
Or may incomplete simply necessary axiom discovered included
For example without incomplete possible prove disprove parallel postulate remaining axiom
Similarly theory complete becomes complete extra axiom stating endpoint order
The statement language provable within ZFC ZFC complete
In case obvious candidate new axiom resolve issue
The theory consistent infinite recursively enumerable set axiom encode enough arithmetic hypothesis incompleteness theorem
Thus first incompleteness theorem Peano Arithmetic complete
The theorem give explicit example statement arithmetic neither provable disprovable Peano arithmetic
Moreover statement true usual
Moreover effectively axiomatized consistent extension Peano arithmetic complete
A set axiom simply statement statement negation provable axiom otherwise
Peano arithmetic provably consistent ZFC within
Similarly ZFC provably consistent within ZFC exists prof ZFC consistent least cardinal sitting inside ZFC theory consistent model
If one take statement language axiom theory complete recursively enumerable set axiom describe addition multiplication
However consistent
Additional example inconsistent theory arise result assumed set theory
The incompleteness theorem apply formal system able prove sufficient collection fact natural number
One sufficient collection set theorem
Some system Peano arithmetic directly express statement natural number
Others ZFC set theory able interpret statement natural number language
Either option appropriate incompleteness theorem
The theory given characteristic complete consistent infinite recursively enumerable set axiom
However possible encode integer theory theory describe arithmetic integer
A similar example theory essentially equivalent
So Euclidean geometry Tarski formulation example complete consistent effectively axiomatized theory
The system consists set axiom natural number addition operation multiplication omitted
Presburger arithmetic complete consistent recursively enumerable encode addition multiplication natural number showing Gödel theorem one need theory encode addition also multiplication
studied weak family arithmetic system allow enough arithmetic relation formalise Gödel numbering strong enough multiplication function fail prove second incompleteness theorem system consistent capable proving consistency see
In choosing set axiom one goal able prove many correct result possible without proving incorrect result
For example could imagine set true axiom allow u prove every true arithmetical claim natural number Smith p
In standard system logic inconsistent set axiom prove every statement language sometimes called thus automatically complete
A set axiom complete consistent however prof theorem Hinman
The pattern illustrated previous section Peano arithmetic ZFC ZFC exists inaccessible cardinal generally broken
Here ZFC exists inaccessible cardinal proved consistent
It also complete illustrated ZFC exists inaccessible cardinal theory unresolved continuum hypothesis
The first incompleteness theorem show formal system express basic arithmetic complete consistent finite list axiom never created time additional consistent statement added axiom true statement still proved even new axiom
If axiom ever added make system complete cost making system inconsistent
It even possible infinite list axiom complete consistent effectively axiomatized
first appeared Theorem VI Gödel paper I
The hypothesis theorem improved shortly thereafter Barkley Rosser using
The resulting theorem incorporating Rosser improvement may paraphrased English follows formal system includes assumption system effectively generated
Any consistent formal system within certain amount elementary arithmetic carried incomplete statement language neither proved disproved
Raatikainen The unprovable statement referred theorem often referred Gödel sentence system
The proof construct particular Gödel sentence system infinitely many statement language system share property conjunction Gödel sentence sentence
Each effectively generated system Gödel sentence
It possible define larger system contains whole plus additional axiom
This result complete system Gödel theorem also apply thus also complete
In case indeed theorem axiom
Because state provable contradiction presented provability within
However incompleteness theorem applies new Gödel statement showing also incomplete
differ refer rather
The Gödel sentence designed refer indirectly
The sentence state particular sequence step used construct another sentence constructed sentence provable
However sequence step constructed sentence turn
In way Gödel sentence indirectly state unprovability within Smith
To prove first incompleteness theorem Gödel demonstrated notion provability within system could expressed purely term arithmetical function operate sentence system
Therefore system prove certain fact number also indirectly prove fact statement provided effectively generated
Questions provability statement within system represented question arithmetical property number would decidable system complete
Thus although Gödel sentence refers indirectly sentence system read arithmetical statement Gödel sentence directly refers natural number
It asserts natural number particular property property given relation Smith
As Gödel sentence written language arithmetic simple syntactic form
In particular expressed formula language arithmetic consisting number leading universal quantifier followed body formula level
Via Gödel sentence statement particular polynomial many variable integer coefficient never take value zero integer substituted variable Franzén
The first incompleteness theorem show Gödel sentence appropriate formal theory unprovable
Because unprovability exactly sentence indirectly asserts Gödel sentence fact true Smoryński also see Franzén pp

For reason sentence often said true unprovable
Raatikainen
The truth sentence may arrived via outside system
In general carried within weak formal system known prof implication Con Con canonical sentence asserting consistency Smoryński Kikuchi Tanaka
Although Gödel sentence consistent theory true statement arithmetic Gödel sentence false consequence Gödel Franzén
That theorem show sentence independent theory theory model sentence true model sentence false
As described earlier Gödel sentence system arithmetical statement claim number exists particular property
The incompleteness theorem show claim independent system truth Gödel sentence follows fact standard natural number property question
Any model Gödel sentence false must contain element satisfies property within model
Such model must nonstandard must contain element correspond standard natural number Raatikainen Franzén
Gödel specifically cite semantical analogue syntactical incompleteness result introductory section
The sentence This sentence false
An analysis liar sentence show true asserts false false true
A Gödel sentence system make similar assertion liar sentence truth replaced provability say provable system
The analysis truth provability formalized version analysis truth liar sentence
It possible replace provable false Gödel sentence predicate Q false formula represented formula arithmetic
This result known discovered independently Gödel working proof incompleteness theorem theorem namesake
Compared theorem stated Gödel paper many contemporary statement incompleteness theorem general two way
These generalized statement phrased apply broader class system phrased incorporate weaker consistency assumption
Gödel demonstrated incompleteness system particular system arithmetic parallel demonstration could given effective system certain expressiveness
Gödel commented fact introduction paper restricted proof one system concreteness
In modern statement theorem common state effectiveness expressiveness condition hypothesis incompleteness theorem limited particular formal system
The terminology used state condition yet developed Gödel published result
Gödel original statement proof incompleteness theorem requires assumption system consistent
A system predicate every specific natural number system prof yet system also prof exists natural number
That system say number property exists denying specific value
The system implies consistency consistency imply
strengthened incompleteness theorem finding variation proof requires system consistent rather
This mostly technical interest true formal theory arithmetic theory whose axiom true statement natural number thus Gödel theorem originally stated applies
The stronger version incompleteness theorem assumes consistency rather commonly known Gödel incompleteness theorem theorem
For formal system containing basic arithmetic possible canonically define formula Cons expressing consistency
This formula express property exist natural number coding formal derivation within system whose conclusion syntactic contradiction
The syntactic contradiction often taken case Cons state natural number code derivation axiom
show general assumption canonical consistency statement Cons provable
The theorem first appeared Theorem XI Gödel paper
In following statement term formalized system also includes assumption effectively axiomatized
Assume consistent formalized system contains elementary arithmetic
Then
Raatikainen This theorem stronger first incompleteness theorem statement constructed first incompleteness theorem directly express consistency system
The proof second incompleteness theorem obtained formalizing proof first incompleteness theorem within system
There technical subtlety second incompleteness theorem regarding method expressing consistency formula language
There many way express consistency system lead result
The formula Cons second incompleteness theorem particular expression consistency
Other formalization claim consistent may inequivalent may even provable
For example Peano arithmetic PA prove largest consistent PA consistent
But PA consistent largest consistent subset PA PA sense PA prof consistent
What PA prove largest consistent subset PA fact whole The term largest consistent subset PA meant largest consistent initial segment axiom PA particular effective enumeration
The standard proof second incompleteness theorem assumes provability predicate Prov satisfies
Letting represent Gödel number formula derivability condition say There system Robinson arithmetic strong enough meet assumption first incompleteness theorem prove condition
Peano arithmetic however strong enough verify condition theory stronger Peano arithmetic
Gödel second incompleteness theorem also implies system satisfying technical condition outlined prove consistency system prof consistency
This system prove prof consistency fact consistent
For claim consistent form number decidable property code proof contradiction
If fact inconsistent would prove code contradiction
But also proved consistent n would inconsistent
This reasoning formalized show consistent consistent
Since second incompleteness theorem prove consistency prove consistency either
This corollary second incompleteness theorem show hope proving example consistency Peano arithmetic using finitistic mean formalized system consistency provable Peano arithmetic PA
For example system PRA widely accepted accurate formalization finitistic mathematics provably consistent PA
Thus PRA prove consistency PA
This fact generally seen imply aimed justify use ideal infinitistic mathematical principle proof real finitistic mathematical statement giving finitistic proof ideal principle consistent carried Franzén
The corollary also indicates epistemological relevance second incompleteness theorem
It would actually provide interesting information system proved consistency
This inconsistent theory prove everything including consistency
Thus consistency proof would give u clue whether really consistent doubt consistency would resolved consistency proof
The interest consistency proof lie possibility proving consistency system system sense le doubtful example weaker
For many naturally occurring theory set theory primitive recursive arithmetic consistency provable thus prove consistency corollary second incompleteness theorem
The second incompleteness theorem rule consistency proof altogether consistency proof formalized system proved consistent
For example proved consistency Peano arithmetic different system includes axiom asserting called ε see
Gentzen theorem spurred development proof theory
There two distinct sens word undecidable mathematics computer science
The first sense used relation Gödel theorem statement neither provable refutable specified
The second sense discussed used relation applies statement countably infinite set question requiring yes answer
Such problem said undecidable correctly answer every question problem set see
Because two meaning word undecidable term sometimes used instead undecidable neither provable refutable sense
Undecidability statement particular deductive system address question whether statement whether determined mean
Undecidability implies particular deductive system considered prove truth falsity statement
Whether exist absolutely undecidable statement whose truth value never known controversial point
The combined work Gödel given two concrete example undecidable statement first sense term The neither proved refuted standard axiomatization neither proved refuted ZF ZFC axiom axiom choice
These result require incompleteness theorem
Gödel proved neither statement could disproved ZF ZFC set theory
In Cohen proved neither provable ZF continuum hypothesis proved ZFC
In showed undecidable first sense term standard set theory
produced undecidable statement proved another incompleteness theorem setting
state system represent enough arithmetic upper bound specific number proved system greater
While Gödel theorem related Chaitin result related
These natural mathematical equivalent Gödel true undecidable sentence
They proved larger system generally accepted valid form reasoning undecidable limited system Peano Arithmetic
In proved version infinite undecidable proved stronger system
Kirby Paris later showed statement sequence natural number somewhat simpler principle also undecidable Peano arithmetic
application computer science also undecidable Peano arithmetic provable set theory
In fact Kruskal tree theorem finite form undecidable much stronger system codifying principle acceptable based philosophy mathematics called
The related general consequence
The incompleteness theorem closely related several result
presented proof Gödel incompleteness theorem using basic result computability theory
One result show undecidable computer program correctly determine given program input whether eventually halt run particular given input
Kleene showed existence complete effective system arithmetic certain consistency property would force halting problem decidable contradiction
This method proof also presented Shoenfield Charlesworth Hopcroft Ullman
Franzén explains used obtain proof Gödel first incompleteness theorem
proved algorithm given multivariate polynomial p x x x integer coefficient determines whether integer solution equation
Because polynomial integer coefficient integer directly expressible language arithmetic multivariate integer polynomial equation solution integer sufficiently strong system arithmetic prove
Moreover system never prove particular polynomial equation solution fact solution integer
Thus complete would possible determine algorithmically whether polynomial equation solution merely enumerating proof either solution solution found contradiction Matiyasevich theorem
Moreover consistent effectively generated system possible effectively generate multivariate polynomial integer equation solution integer lack solution proved Davis Jones
Smorynski show existence used prove first incompleteness theorem
This proof often extended show system Peano arithmetic see Kleene
give different method producing independent sentence based
Like proof presented Kleene mentioned Chaitin theorem applies theory additional property axiom true standard model natural number
Gödel incompleteness theorem distinguished applicability consistent theory nonetheless include statement false standard model theory known
The three essential part
To begin choose formal system meet proposed criterion The main problem fleshing proof described seems first construct statement equivalent proved would somehow contain reference could easily give rise infinite regress
Gödel ingenious technique show statement matched number often called arithmetization way replaced
This allows formula constructed way avoids infinite regress definition
The technique later used work
In simple term method devised every formula statement formulated system get unique number called way possible mechanically convert back forth formula Gödel number
The number involved might long indeed term number digit barrier matter number constructed
A simple example way English stored sequence number computer using In principle proving statement true false shown equivalent proving number matching statement given property
Because formal system strong enough support reasoning support reasoning well
Crucially system support reasoning result equivalent reasoning
Having shown principle system indirectly make statement provability analyzing property number representing statement possible show create statement actually
A formula contains exactly one free variable called
As soon replaced specific number statement form turn statement either provable system
For certain formula one show every natural number n F n true proved precise requirement original proof weaker proof sketch suffice
In particular true every specific arithmetic operation finite number natural number
Statement form statement therefore proved disproved
But every statement form assigned Gödel number denoted
The choice free variable used form relevant assignment Gödel number
The notion provability also encoded Gödel number following way since proof list statement obey certain rule Gödel number proof defined
Now every statement one may ask whether number Gödel number proof
The relation Gödel number potential Gödel number proof arithmetical relation two number
Therefore statement form Bew us arithmetical relation state Gödel number proof exists The name short German word provable name originally used Gödel denote provability formula described
Note Bew merely abbreviation represents particular long formula original language string Bew claimed part language
An important feature formula Bew statement provable system Bew also provable
This proof would corresponding Gödel number existence cause Bew satisfied
The next step proof obtain statement indirectly asserts unprovability
Although Gödel constructed statement directly existence least one statement follows say sufficiently strong formal system statement form statement system prof By letting negation Bew obtain theorem defined roughly state Gödel number Gödel number unprovable formula
The statement literally equal rather state certain calculation performed resulting Gödel number unprovable statement
But calculation performed resulting Gödel number turn Gödel number
This similar following sentence English This sentence directly refer stated transformation made original sentence obtained result thus sentence indirectly asserts unprovability
The proof diagonal lemma employ similar method
Now assume axiomatic system let statement obtained previous section
If provable Bew would provable argued
But asserts negation Bew
Thus system would inconsistent proving statement negation
This contradiction show provable
If negation provable Bew would provable constructed equivalent negation Bew
However specific number Gödel number proof provable previous paragraph
Thus one hand system prof number certain property Gödel number proof hand every specific number prove property
This impossible system
Thus negation provable
Thus statement undecidable axiomatic system neither proved disproved within system
In fact show provable requires assumption system consistent
The stronger assumption required show negation provable
Thus constructed particular system If one try add missing axiom avoid incompleteness system one add either axiom
But definition Gödel number proof statement change
mean formula Bew different
Thus apply diagonal lemma new Bew obtain new statement different previous one undecidable new system
sketch alternative proof first incompleteness theorem us rather construct true unprovable formula
A similar proof method independently discovered Boolos
Boolos proof proceeds constructing set true sentence arithmetic another sentence true contained
This give first incompleteness theorem corollary
According Boolos proof interesting provides different sort reason incompleteness effective consistent theory arithmetic Boolos
The incompleteness theorem among relatively small number nontrivial theorem transformed formalized theorem completely verified software
Gödel original proof incompleteness theorem like mathematical proof written natural language intended human reader
proof version first incompleteness theorem announced using Shankar Russell using John Harrison using Harrison
A proof incompleteness theorem announced using Paulson
The main difficulty proving second incompleteness theorem show various fact provability used proof first incompleteness theorem formalized within system using formal predicate provability
Once done second incompleteness theorem follows formalizing entire proof first incompleteness theorem within system
Let stand undecidable sentence constructed assume consistency system proved within system
The demonstration show system consistent provable
The proof implication formalized within system therefore statement provable proved system
But last statement equivalent equivalence proved system proved system
This contradiction show system must inconsistent
The incompleteness result affect particularly version use single system formal logic define principle
The incompleteness theorem sometimes thought severe consequence program proposed aimed define natural number term logic Hellman
argue problem logicism incompleteness theorem apply equally first order logic arithmetic
They argue believe natural number defined term first order logic problem
Many logician believe Gödel incompleteness theorem struck fatal blow asked finitary consistency proof mathematics
The second incompleteness theorem particular often viewed making problem impossible
Not mathematician agree analysis however status Hilbert second problem yet decided see
Authors including philosopher physicist debated anything Gödel incompleteness theorem imply human intelligence
Much debate center whether human mind equivalent finite machine
If machine consistent Gödel incompleteness theorem would apply
suggested Gödel theorem applied human since make mistake therefore inconsistent may applied human faculty science mathematics general
Assuming consistent either consistency proved represented Turing machine
proposed concept mathematical knowability based rather logical decidability
He writes interpreted modern standard namely via computational complexity Gödel phenomenon much u
Although Gödel theorem usually studied context classical logic also role study inherently contradictory statement
argues replacing notion formal proof Gödel theorem usual notion informal proof used show naive mathematics inconsistent us evidence
The cause inconsistency inclusion truth predicate system within language system Priest
give mixed appraisal application Gödel theorem dialetheism
Appeals analogy sometimes made incompleteness theorem support argument go beyond mathematics logic
Several author commented negatively extension interpretation including
Bricmont Stangroom example quote comment disparity Gödel avowed us idea sometimes put
Sokal Bricmont criticize invocation theorem context sociology Debray defended use metaphorical ibid
After Gödel published proof doctoral thesis turned second problem
His original goal obtain positive solution Dawson
At time theory natural number real number similar known analysis theory natural number alone known arithmetic
Gödel person working consistency problem
published flawed consistency proof analysis attempted use method originally developed Hilbert
Later year able correct proof system arithmetic without axiom induction
By Ackermann communicated modified proof Bernays modified proof led Hilbert announce belief consistency arithmetic demonstrated consistency proof analysis would likely soon follow
After publication incompleteness theorem showed Ackermann modified proof must erroneous von Neumann produced concrete example showing main technique unsound Zach Zach
In course research Gödel discovered although sentence asserts falsehood lead paradox sentence asserts
In particular Gödel aware result called although never published
Gödel announced first incompleteness theorem Carnap Feigel Waismann August four would attend key conference Königsberg following week
The conference joint meeting three academic society many key logician time attendance
Carnap Heyting von Neumann delivered address mathematical philosophy logicism intuitionism formalism respectively Dawson
The conference also included Hilbert retirement address leaving position University Göttingen
Hilbert used speech argue belief mathematical problem solved
He ended address saying This speech quickly became known summary Hilbert belief mathematics final six word used Hilbert epitaph
Although Gödel likely attendance Hilbert address two never met face face Dawson
Gödel announced first incompleteness theorem roundtable discussion session third day conference
The announcement drew little attention apart von Neumann pulled Gödel aside conversation
Later year working independently knowledge first incompleteness theorem von Neumann obtained proof second incompleteness theorem announced Gödel letter dated November Dawson
Gödel independently obtained second incompleteness theorem included submitted manuscript received November
Gödel paper published title Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I
As title implies Gödel originally planned publish second part paper never written
Gödel gave series lecture theorem Princeton audience included Church Kleene Rosser
By time Gödel grasped key property theorem required system must effective time term general recursive used
Rosser proved hypothesis integral part Gödel original proof could replaced simple consistency Gödel sentence changed appropriate way
These development left incompleteness theorem essentially modern form
Gentzen published arithmetic
Hilbert accepted proof finitary although Gödel theorem already shown formalized within system arithmetic proved consistent
The impact incompleteness theorem Hilbert program quickly realized
Bernays included full proof incompleteness theorem second volume along additional result Ackermann method Gentzen consistency proof arithmetic
This first full published proof second incompleteness theorem

In September wrote Gödel announce described essential gap Gödel argument
In October Gödel replied letter pointed Zermelo mistakenly assumed notion truth system definable system true general
But Zermelo relent published criticism print rather scathing paragraph young competitor
Gödel decided pursue matter pointless Carnap agreed
Much Zermelo subsequent work related logic stronger logic hoped show consistency categoricity mathematical theory
wrote several passage incompleteness theorem published posthumously particular one section sometimes called notorious paragraph seems confuse notion true provable Russell system
Gödel member period Wittgenstein early dominated circle thinking
There controversy whether Wittgenstein misunderstood incompleteness theorem expressed unclearly
Writings Gödel express belief Wittgenstein misread idea
Multiple commentator read Wittgenstein misunderstanding Rodych although well provided textual reading arguing commentary misunderstands Wittgenstein
On release Bernays Dummett Kreisel wrote separate review Wittgenstein remark extremely negative Berto
The unanimity criticism caused Wittgenstein remark incompleteness theorem little impact logic community
In Gödel stated Has Wittgenstein lost mind
Does mean seriously
He intentionally utters trivially nonsensical statement Wang wrote Wittgenstein comment demonstrate misunderstanding incompleteness theorem writing Since publication Wittgenstein series paper philosophy sought evaluate whether original criticism Wittgenstein remark justified
Floyd Putnam argue Wittgenstein complete understanding incompleteness theorem previously assumed
They particularly concerned interpretation Gödel sentence system actually saying I provable since system model provability predicate corresponds actual provability
Rodych argues interpretation Wittgenstein historically justified Bays argues Floyd Putnam philosophical analysis provability predicate
Berto explores relationship Wittgenstein writing theory paraconsistent logic

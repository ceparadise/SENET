In science measurement collection quantitative numerical data describes property object event
A measurement made comparing quantity
Since comparison perfect measurement inherently include much measured value deviate true value
The study measurement called metrology
There many measurement system used throughout history across world progress made since century setting international standard
The modern SI base type physical measurement
Measuring volume cup water Erlenmeyer flask give better measurement trying gauge volume putting bucket even measurement reported using unit milliliter
So criterion scientist used compare measurement type magnitude unit
The level type methodology used taking measurement
Magnitude actual numerical value measurement
Unit ratio number standard quantity gram candela micrometer
Uncertainty reflects systematic random error measurement
Uncertainty description confidence accuracy precision measurement typically expressed error
Measurements calibrated say compared set standard system measuring device deliver value match another person would obtain measurement repeated
There common standard system may encounter SI come French name It commonly used metric system
SI specific metric system decimal system measurement
Examples two common form metric system MKS system meter kilogram second base unit CGS system centimeter gram second base unit
There many unit SI form metric system built upon combination base unit
These called derived unit The British Imperial system measurement common SI unit adopted
Although Britain largely adopted SI system United States Caribbean country still use English system
This system based unit unit length mass time
There error

Some complicated model represent system MAS multiple decision maker
Brahms language model MAS
These MAS model often workframes change state system communication activity coordinate information agent behavior system often depends schedule runtime since many agent operate concurrently
The primary method test model exists repeated simulation
Simulation useful insofar interesting test case used enable simulation explore different behavior model simulation alone fully relied upon adequately cover test space especially case concurrent system
It take exponential number simulation trial uncover schedule reveal unexpected behavior
This thesis defines coverage metric make simulation meaningful verification model
The coverage metric divided three different metric workframe coverage communication coverage schedule coverage
Each coverage metric defined static analysis system resulting coverage requirement system
These coverage requirement compared logged output simulation run calculate coverage system
The use coverage metric illustrated several empirical study explored detailed case study SATS concept Small Aircraft Transportation System
SATS outline procedure aircraft follow around runway communication tower
The coverage metric quantifies test effort used basis future automated test generation active test

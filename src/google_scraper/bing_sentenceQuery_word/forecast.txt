Forecasting help deal trouble help know general principle forecasting currently technique suited need moment
Here author try explain potential forecasting manager focusing special attention sale forecasting product Corning Glass Works matured product life cycle
Also included rundown forecasting technique
To handle increasing variety complexity managerial forecasting problem many forecasting technique developed recent year
Each special use care must taken select correct technique particular application
The manager well forecaster role play technique selection better understand range forecasting possibility likely company forecasting effort bear fruit
The selection method depends many context forecast relevance availability historical data degree accuracy desirable time period forecast benefit forecast company time available making analysis
These factor must weighed constantly variety level
In general example forecaster choose technique make best use available data
If forecaster readily apply one technique acceptable accuracy try gold plate using advanced technique offer potentially greater accuracy requires nonexistent information information costly obtain
This kind relatively easy make others shall see require considerably thought
Furthermore company wish forecast reference particular product must consider
The availability data possibility establishing relationship factor depend directly maturity product hence stage prime determinant forecasting method used
Our purpose present overview field discussing way company ought approach forecasting problem describing method available explaining match method problem
We shall illustrate use various technique experience Corning close forecast future forecasting
Although believe forecasting still art think principle learned experience may helpful others
A manager generally assumes asking forecaster prepare specific projection request provides sufficient information forecaster go work job
This almost never true
Successful forecasting begin collaboration manager forecaster work answer following question
This determines accuracy power required technique hence governs selection
Deciding whether enter business may require rather gross estimate size market whereas forecast made budgeting purpose quite accurate
The appropriate technique differ accordingly
Again forecast set standard evaluate performance forecasting method take account special action promotion marketing device since meant change historical pattern relationship hence form part performance evaluated
Forecasts simply sketch future like company make significant change tactic strategy usually good enough planning purpose
On hand management want forecast effect certain marketing strategy debate sale growth technique must sophisticated enough take explicit account special action event strategy entail
Techniques vary cost well scope accuracy
The manager must fix level inaccuracy word decide decision vary depending range accuracy forecast
This allows forecaster trade cost value accuracy choosing technique
For example production inventory control increased accuracy likely lead lower safety stock
Here manager forecaster must weigh cost sophisticated expensive technique potential saving inventory cost
Exhibit I show cost accuracy increase sophistication chart corresponding cost forecasting error given general assumption
The sophisticated technique economically justified one fall region sum two cost minimal
Once manager defined purpose forecast forecaster advise manager often could usefully produced
From strategic point view discus whether decision made basis forecast changed later find forecast inaccurate
If changed discus usefulness installing system track accuracy forecast kind tracking system appropriate
This clarifies relationship interacting variable
Generally manager forecaster must review flow chart show relative position different element distribution system sale system production system whatever studied
Exhibit II display element system CGW major component color TV consumer
Note point inventory required maintained manufacturing distribution exert important effect throughout flow system hence critical interest forecaster
All element dark gray directly affect forecasting procedure extent color key suggests nature CGW data point prime determinant technique selection since different technique require different kind input
Where data unavailable costly obtain range forecasting choice limited
The flow chart also show part system control company forecasting
In Exhibit II merely volume glass panel funnel supplied Corning tube manufacturer
In part system company total control management tends tuned various relationship hence frequently use forecasting technique take causal factor explicitly account
The flow chart special value forecaster causal prediction method called enables conjecture possible variation sale level caused inventory like determine factor must considered technique provide executive forecast acceptable accuracy
Once factor relationship clarified forecaster build causal model system capture fact logic basis sophisticated forecasting
Significant change product new competitive strategy similarity past future
Over short term recent change unlikely cause overall pattern alter long term effect likely increase
The executive forecaster must discus fully
Once manager forecaster formulated problem forecaster position choose method
There three basic
The first us qualitative data expert opinion example information special event kind already mentioned may may take past consideration
The second hand focus entirely pattern pattern change thus relies entirely historical data
The third us highly refined specific information relationship system element powerful enough take special event formally account
As time series analysis projection technique past important causal model
These difference imply quite correctly type forecasting technique appropriate forecast sale say stage life cycle example technique relies historical data would useful forecasting future totally new product history
The major part balance article concerned problem suiting technique stage
We hope give executive insight potential forecasting showing problem approached
But discus life cycle need sketch general function three basic type technique bit detail
Primarily used data example product first introduced market
They use human judgment rating scheme turn qualitative information quantitative estimate
The objective bring together logical unbiased systematic way information judgment relate factor estimated
Such technique frequently used area development product idea may require several invention R D demand difficult estimate market acceptance penetration rate highly uncertain
The chart Basic Forecasting Techniques present several example type see first section including market research Delphi technique
In chart tried provide body basic information main kind forecasting technique
Some technique listed reality single method model whole family
Thus statement may accurately describe variation technique rather interpreted descriptive basic concept
A disclaimer estimate chart also order
Estimates cost approximate computation time accuracy rating rating identification
The cost procedure depend whether used routinely set single forecast also weighting seasonal determined anew time forecast made cost increase significantly
Still figure present may serve general guideline
The reader may find frequent reference helpful remainder article
These statistical technique used several year data product product line available relationship trend clear relatively stable
One basic principle statistical forecasting historical data forecaster use data past performance get speedometer reading current rate sale say fast rate increasing decreasing
The current rate change acceleration deceleration basis forecasting
Once known various mathematical technique develop projection
The matter simple sound however
It usually difficult make projection raw data since rate trend immediately obvious mixed seasonal variation example perhaps distorted factor effect large sale promotion campaign
The raw data must massaged usable frequently done time series analysis
Now set chronologically ordered point raw example division sale given product month several year
Time series help identify explain Unfortunately existing method identify seasonal combined effect trend cycle irregular chance component
That separate
We shall return point discus time series analysis final stage product maturity
Once analysis complete work projecting future sale whatever begin
We note separated analysis projection purpose explanation statistical forecasting technique actually combine function single operation
It obvious description statistical technique based assumption existing pattern continue future
This assumption likely correct short term long term reason technique provide u reasonably accurate forecast immediate future quite poorly future unless data pattern extraordinarily stable
For reason technique ordinarily predict rate growth trend change example period slow growth sale suddenly change period rapid decay
Such point called
They naturally greatest consequence manager shall see forecaster must use different tool pure statistical technique predict occur
When historical data available enough analysis performed spell explicitly relationship factor forecast factor related business economic force socioeconomic factor forecaster often construct
A causal model sophisticated kind forecasting tool
It express mathematically relevant causal relationship may include pipeline consideration inventory market survey information
It may also directly incorporate result time series analysis
The causal model take account everything known dynamic flow system utilizes prediction related event competitive action strike promotion
If data available model generally includes factor location flow chart illustrated Exhibit II connects equation describe overall product flow
If certain kind data lacking initially may necessary make assumption relationship track happening determine assumption true
Typically causal model continually revised knowledge system becomes available
Again see gatefold rundown common type causal technique
As chart show causal model far best predicting turning point preparing forecast
At stage life product conception sale decision management must make characteristically quite different require different kind information base
The forecasting technique provide set information differ analogously
Exhibit III summarizes life stage product typical decision made main forecasting technique suitable
Equally different product may require different kind forecasting
Two CGW product handled quite differently major glass component color TV tube Corning prime supplier Corning Ware cookware proprietary consumer product line
We shall trace forecasting method used four different stage maturity product give firsthand insight choice application major technique available today
Before begin let u note situation differ two kind product Many change shipment rate overall profitability therefore due action taken manufacturer
Tactical decision promotion special pricing usually discretion well
The technique selected forecaster projecting sale therefore permit incorporation special One may start simple technique work sophisticated one embrace possibility final goal
Between two example discussion embrace nearly whole range forecasting technique
As necessary however shall touch product forecasting method
In early stage product development manager want answer question Forecasts help answer question must necessarily long horizon
A common objection much forecasting virtually impossible predict accuracy happen several year future
We agree uncertainty increase forecast made period two year
However least forecast measure accuracy enable manager know risk pursuing selected strategy knowledge choose appropriate strategy available
Systematic market research course mainstay area
For example priority pattern analysis describe consumer preference likelihood buy product thus great value forecasting updating penetration level rate
But tool well depending state market product concept
While direct data product still gleam eye information likely performance gathered number way provided market sold known entity
one compare proposed product competitor present planned product ranking quantitative scale different factor
We call
If approach successful essential expert provide basic data come different R D manufacturing legal opinion unbiased
formalistically one construct separating different segment complex market individual study consideration
Specifically often useful project growth curve level income different geographical region
When color TV bulb proposed product CGW able identify factor would influence sale growth
Then disaggregating consumer demand making certain assumption factor possible develop rate penetration household market proved useful u
one compare projected product ancestor similar characteristic
In disaggregated market color television income level geographical region compared submarkets historical pattern TV market growth
We justified procedure arguing color TV represented advance analogous although le intense advance TV represented radio
The analysis TV market growth also enabled u estimate variability degree projection would differ actual result economic factor
The price TV major household appliance consumer disposable income price color TV appliance consumer disposable income profitably considered developing forecast penetration national basis
The success pattern TV provided insight likelihood success sale potential color TV
Our prediction consumer acceptance Corning Ware cookware hand derived primarily one expert source manager thoroughly understood consumer preference housewares market
These prediction well borne
This reinforces belief sale forecast new product compete existing market bound incomplete uncertain unless one cull best judgment fully experienced personnel
Frequently however market new product weakly defined data available product concept still fluid history seems irrelevant
This case gas turbine electric steam automobile modular housing pollution measurement device computer terminal
Many organization applied Delphi method soliciting consolidating expert opinion circumstance
At CGW several instance used estimate demand new product success
analysis combined technique extremely useful projecting future course broad technology broad change economy
The basic tool table industry various updating table prepared number group wished extrapolate figure make forecast later year
Since business product line may represent small sector industry may difficult use table directly
However number company disaggregating industry evaluate sale potential forecast change product phasing old line introduction others
For example Corporation MAPTEK developed technique make analysis directly useful people electronics business today
Other technique panel consensus visionary forecasting seem le effective u evaluate experience
Before product enter hopefully rapid penetration stage market potential must tested product must market testing may advisable
At stage management need answer question Significant profit depend finding right answer therefore economically feasible expend relatively large amount effort money obtaining good forecast
A sale forecast stage provide three point information date rapid sale begin rate market penetration stage ultimate level penetration sale rate stage
The date product enter stage hard predict three four year advance usual horizon
A company recourse use statistical tracking method check successfully product introduced along routine market study determine significant increase sale rate
Furthermore greatest care taken analyzing early sale data start accumulate product introduced market
For example important distinguish sale try anything new sale buy product accepted innovator latter group provides demand stability
Many new product initially appeared successful purchase innovator fail later stretch
Tracking two group mean market research possibly via opinion panel
A panel ought contain innovator imitator since innovator teach one lot improve product imitator provide insight desire expectation whole market
The color TV set example introduced gain acceptance majority consumer late
To sure color TV set could leave introduction stage enter stage network substantially increased color programming
However special flag signal like substantially increased network color programming likely come fact planning viewpoint general find scientifically designed consumer survey conducted regular basis provide earliest mean detecting turning point demand product
Although statistical tracking useful tool early introduction stage rarely sufficient data statistical forecasting
Market research study naturally useful indicated
But commonly forecaster try identify similar older product whose penetration pattern similar new product since overall market exhibit consistent pattern
Again let consider color television forecast prepared
For year Exhibit IV show total consumer expenditure appliance expenditure expenditure radio TVs relevant percentage
Column show total expenditure appliance relatively stable period several year hence new appliance must compete existing one especially recession note figure
Certain special fluctuation figure special significance
When TV introduced new product ratio expenditure radio TV set total expenditure consumer good see column increased modest increase ratio next decade
A similar increase occurred color TV made major penetration
Probably acceptance TV major appliance caused ratio major household appliance total consumer good see column rise word innovation TV caused consumer start spending money major appliance around
Our expectation introduction color TV would induce similar increase
Thus although product comparison provide u accurate detailed forecast place upper bound future total sale could expect
The next step look cumulative penetration curve TVs household shown Exhibit We assumed penetration would similar would take longer color set penetrate whole market reach sale
Whereas took TV year reach steady state qualitative study indicated would take color twice gradual slope curve
At time study conducted showed significantly different penetration sale color TV various income group rate helpful u projecting curve tracking accuracy projection
With data assumption forecast retail sale remainder see dotted section lower curve Exhibit V
The forecast accurate high following three year primarily declining general economic condition changing pricing policy We note developed forecast technique recognized additional technique would necessary later time maintain accuracy would needed subsequent period
These forecast provided acceptable accuracy time made however since major goal estimate penetration rate ultimate level sale
Making refined estimate pipeline behave activity properly belongs next stage
When possible identify similar product case CGW oven cooking range Counterange another approach must used
For purpose initial introduction market may necessary determine minimum sale rate required product venture meet corporate objective
Analyses like historical trend technological forecasting used estimate minimum
Also feasibility entering market continuing R D right stage best determined sensitivity analysis
To estimate date product enter stage another matter
As seen date function many factor existence distribution system customer acceptance familiarity product concept need met product significant event color network programming
As well reviewing behavior similar product date may estimated Delphi exercise rating ranking scheme whereby factor important customer acceptance estimated competitor product rated factor overall score tallied competitor score new product
As said usually difficult forecast precisely turning point occur experience best accuracy expected within three month two year actual time
It occasionally true course one certain new product enthusiastically accepted
Market test initial customer reaction made clear would large market Corning Ware cookware
Since distribution system already existence time required line reach rapid growth depended primarily ability manufacture
Sometimes forecasting merely matter calculating company ordinarily
When product enters stage important decision relate facility expansion
These decision generally involve largest expenditure cycle excepting major R D decision commensurate forecasting tracking effort justified
Forecasting tracking must provide executive three kind data juncture forecasting market growth rate attainment sale requires measure product introduction marketing study especially survey product comparison
When product entered rapid growth hand generally sufficient data available construct possibly even growth model although latter necessarily contain assumption must verified later
We estimated growth rate rate color TV crude model data available beginning stage
We conducted frequent marketing study well
The growth rate Corning Ware Cookware explained limited primarily production capability hence basic information predicted case date leveling growth
Because substantial inventory buffered information consumer sale along line good field data lacking made date difficult estimate
Eventually found necessary establish better direct field information system
As well merely buffering information case component product pipeline exerts certain distorting effect manufacturer demand effect although highly important often illogically neglected production capacity planning
While demand pipeline like retail sale may lag lead sale several month distorting shape demand component supplier
Exhibit VI show trend demand component supplier Corning function distributor sale distributor inventory
As one see curve supplier sale may grow relatively sharply several month peak retail sale leveled
The implication curve facility planning allocation obvious
Here used component color TV set illustration know experience importance long flow time color TVs result many sequential step manufacturing distribution recall Exhibit II
There spectacular example instance uncommon flow time component supplier consumer stretch two year case truck engine
To estimate total demand CGW production used retail demand model pipeline simulation
The model incorporated penetration rate mortality curve like
We combined data generated model data data glass loss information make corpus input pipeline simulation
The simulation output allowed u apply projected curve like one shown Exhibit VI planning
Simulation excellent tool circumstance essentially simpler building formal mathematical model
That simulation bypass need analytical solution technique mathematical duplication complex environment allows experimentation
Simulation also informs u pipeline element behave interact useful forecasting especially constructing formal causal model later date
This knowledge absolutely hard course pipeline dynamic must carefully tracked determine various estimate assumption made indeed correct
Statistical method provide good basis estimating checking growth rate signaling turning point occur
In late appeared u demand increasing since consistent positive difference actual TV bulb sale forecasted bulb sale
Conversations product manager personnel indicated might significant change pipeline activity appeared rapid increase retail demand boosting glass requirement could create hump like one illustrated Exhibit VI
This humping provided additional profit CGW adverse effect
We able predict hump unfortunately unable reduce avoid pipeline sufficiently control
The inventory along pipeline also follow shown Exhibit VI fact creates compound two characteristic condition pipeline whole initial overfilling subsequent shift much little inventory various sequence condition
For example simpler distribution system Corning Ware like one examined
When retail sale slowed rapid normal growth however early indication shipment data crucial turning point reached
Data distributor inventory gave u warning pipeline filling turning point retail level still identified quickly enough mentioned lack good data level
We monitor field information regularly identify significant change adjust shipment forecast accordingly
One main activity stage check earlier estimate appear incorrect compute accurately possible error forecast obtain revised estimate
In instance model developed earlier include macroterms case market research provide information needed break component
For example forecasting model initially considered total set penetration different income level without considering way set used
Therefore conducted market survey determine set use precisely
Equally stage submodels pipeline segment expanded incorporate detailed information received
In case color TV found able estimate overall pipeline requirement glass bulb CGW factor glass loss postulate probability distribution around likely estimate
Over time easy check forecast actual volume sale hence check procedure generating
We also found increase number factor simulation instance expand model consider different size improved overall accuracy usefulness
The preceding one approach used forecasting sale new product rapid growth
Others discussed different one
The decision manager stage quite different made earlier
Most facility planning squared away trend growth rate become reasonably stable
It possible swing demand profit occur changing economic condition new competitive product pipeline dynamic manager maintain tracking activity even introduce new one
However large manager concentrate forecasting attention area The manager also need good tracking warning system identify significantly declining demand product hopefully long way
To sure manager want margin profit projection forecast assist planning corporate level
However sale forecast basic elaborate undertaking shall concentrate sale forecast
In planning production establishing marketing strategy short medium term manager first consideration usually accurate estimate present sale level accurate estimate rate level changing
The forecaster thus called two related contribution stage The type product scrutiny important selecting technique used
For Corning Ware level distribution system organized relatively straightforward way use statistical method forecast shipment field information forecast change shipment rate
We process incorporating special strategy economic forecast shipment forecast
This leading u direction causal forecasting model
On hand component supplier may able forecast total sale sufficient accuracy production planning pipeline environment may complex best recourse projection rely primarily salesperson estimate
We find true example estimating demand TV glass size customer
In case best role statistical method providing guide check salesperson forecast
In general however point life cycle sufficient time series data available enough causal relationship known direct experience market study forecaster indeed apply two powerful set tool
Historical data least last several year available
The forecaster use one way another
We might mention common criticism point
People frequently object using recent data point sale figure immediate past building projection since say current situation always dynamic condition changing radically quickly historical data back time little value
We think point view little validity
A graph several year sale data one shown Exhibit VII give impression sale trend one could possibly get one look two three latest data point
In practice find overall pattern tend continue minimum one two quarter future even special condition cause sale fluctuate one two monthly period immediate future
For forecasting one three month ahead effect factor general economic condition minimal cause radical shift demand pattern
And trend tend change gradually rather suddenly statistical quantitative method excellent forecasting
Using one recent data point result giving insufficient consideration nature trend cycle seasonal fluctuation sale
Not directly related product forecasting still important success certain application briefly mention particularly interested
While method econometric causal model good forecasting aggregated sale number item economically feasible use technique controlling inventory individual item
Some requirement forecasting technique production inventory control purpose must meet One first technique developed meet criterion called recent data point given greater weight previous data point little data storage required
This technique considerable improvement moving average technique adapt quickly change trend requires significantly data storage
also meet criterion
An extension exponential smoothing computes seasonal thereby provides accurate forecast obtained exponential smoothing significant seasonal
There number variation exponential smoothing adaptive forecasting method however common characteristic least descriptive sense new forecast equal old forecast plus fraction latest forecast error
Virtually statistical technique described discussion phase except categorized special case recently developed technique
This technique requires considerably computer time item present time human attention well
Until computational shortcut developed limited use production inventory control area
However one important feature existing statistical technique ability incorporate special information example price change economic data forecast
The reason costly statistical technique user must select particular version technique must estimate optimal value various parameter model must
For example type length moving average used determined variability characteristic data hand
We expect better computer method developed near future significantly reduce cost
In instance statistical method provide acceptable accuracy individual item one obtain desired accuracy grouping item together reduces relative amount randomness data
Forecasters commonly use approach get acceptable accuracy situation virtually impossible obtain accurate forecast individual item
Also sometimes possible accurately forecast demand even though swing may chaotic accurately forecasted
We found case forecasting individual item line color TV bulb demand CGW fluctuate widely customer schedule
In case considerable difficulty achieving desired profit level scheduling take objective consideration
Hence two type forecast needed For reason forecasting technique exponential smoothing adaptive forecasting permit incorporation special information advantageous also use sophisticated technique group item
This technique applied analyze forecast rate total business also identify peculiarity sudden change trend pattern
This information incorporated item forecast adjustment smoothing mechanism seasonal like necessary
Frequently one must develop feature allows adjustment based human judgment circumstance fluid
Granting applicability technique must go explain forecaster identifies precisely happening sale fluctuate one period next fluctuation forecast
A trend seasonal obviously two quite different thing must handled separately forecasting
Consider would happen example forecaster merely take average recent data point along curve combine similar average point stretching backward immediate past use basis projection
The forecaster might easily overreact random change mistaking evidence prevailing trend mistake change growth rate seasonal
To avoid precisely sort error moving average technique similar hypothetical one described us data point way effect seasonal irregularity eliminated
Furthermore executive need accurate estimate trend accurate estimate seasonality plan production determine marketing effort allocation maintain proper inventory adequate customer demand excessively costly
Before going might well illustrate look like
Exhibit VII show initial decomposition raw data factory sale color TV set
present raw data curve
show seasonal factor implicit raw consistent pattern although variation year year
In next section shall explain graph seasonal come
show result discounting raw data curve seasonal deseasonalized data curve
Next drawn smoothest best curve possible deseasonalized curve thereby obtaining
We might note difference line deseasonalized data curve represent irregular nonsystematic component forecaster must always tolerate attempt explain method
In sum objective forecasting technique used best possible job sorting trend seasonalities
Unfortunately forecasting method project smoothing process analogous moving average technique like hypothetical technique described beginning section separating trend seasonal precisely require extra effort cost
Still approach proved practice
We best explain reason success roughly outlining way construct sale forecast basis trend seasonal data derived
This method In special case seasonal considered course process much simplified fewer data simpler technique may adequate
We found analysis pattern change growth rate give u accuracy predicting turning point therefore change positive negative growth vice versa use trend cycle
The main advantage considering growth change fact frequently possible predict earlier situation occur
The graph change growth thus provides excellent visual base forecasting identifying turning point well
The reader curious know one break seasonal raw sale data exactly one derives curve trend line
One best technique know analyzing historical data depth determine seasonal present sale rate growth Census Bureau Technique simultaneously remove seasonal raw information fit line data
It comprehensive cost provides detailed information seasonal trend accuracy seasonal trend cycle fit number measure
The output includes plot trend cycle growth rate concurrently received graphic display terminal
Although originally developed forecasting method establish base good forecast made
One note however instability trend line recent data point since like virtually statistical technique us form moving average
It therefore proved value study change growth pattern new growth point obtained
In particular recent data seem reflect sharp growth decline sale market anomaly forecaster determine whether special event occurred period strike change economy
The provides basic instrumentation needed evaluate effect event
Generally even growth pattern associated specific event technique statistical method give good result forecasting beyond six month uncertainty unpredictable nature event
For forecast one three month technique proved reasonably accurate
We used provide sale estimate division three period future well determine change sale rate
We compared forecast forecast developed several division division used variety method take account salesperson estimate special knowledge
The forecast using technique based statistical method alone consider special information
The division forecast slightly error provided method however division forecast found slightly biased optimistic side whereas provided method unbiased
This suggested u better job forecasting could done combining special knowledge technique division method
This actually done division forecasting accuracy improved consequence
The method also used make sale projection immediate future serve standard evaluating various marketing strategy
This found especially effective estimating effect price change promotion
As indicated earlier trend analysis frequently used project annual data several year determine sale current trend continues
Regression analysis statistical forecast sometimes used estimate happen significant change made
Then result acceptable respect corporate objective company change strategy
Over long period time change general economic condition account significant part change product growth rate
Because economic forecast becoming accurate also certain general leading economic force change subsequent change specific industry possible improve forecast business including economic factor forecasting model
However development model usually called econometric model requires sufficient data correct relationship established
During state color TV recognized economic condition would probably effect sale rate significantly
However macroanalyses TV data made recession late early show substantial economic effect hence sufficient data establish good econometric relationship color TV model
A later investigation establish definite loss color TV sale due economic condition
In Corning decided better method definitely needed predict turning point retail sale color TV six month two year future
Statistical method salesperson estimate spot turning point far enough advance assist decision making example production manager three six month warning change order maintain stable work force
Adequate data seemed available build econometric model analysis therefore begun develop model color TV sale
Our knowledge seasonal trend growth product formed natural base constructing equation model
The economic input model primarily obtained information generated Wharton Econometric Model source also utilized
Using data extending model reasonably well predicting downturn fourth quarter data also incorporated model accurately estimated magnitude drop first two quarter
Because relationship ready availability economic forecast factor model effect economy sale estimated far two year future
In phase production inventory control forecast demand estimate particularly important
The interested reader find discussion topic reverse gatefold
Finally phase useful set quarterly review statistical tracking warning chart new information brought forward
At meeting decision revise update model forecast weighed various cost amount forecasting error
In highly volatile area review occur frequently every month period
In concluding article forecasting appropriate make prediction technique used future
As already said difficult forecast immediate future since trend change overnight
Many technique described early stage application still expect technique used next five year one discussed perhaps extended form
The cost using technique reduced significantly enhance implementation
We expect computer timesharing company offer access nominal cost data bank broken business segment available today
The continuing declining trend computer cost per computation along computational simplification make technique method economically feasible even application
Computer software package statistical technique general model also become available nominal cost
At present time forecasting us statistical method little qualitative information
Where qualitative information used used external way directly incorporated computational routine
We predict change total forecasting system several technique tied together along systematic handling qualitative information
Econometric model utilized extensively next five year large company developing refining econometric model major business
Marketing simulation model new product also developed product tracking system updating model parameter
Heuristic programming provide mean refining forecasting model
While company already developed model tandem government data statistical projection another five ten year model effectively used major corporation
Within five year however shall see extensive use system statistical causal econometric model programmed computer people interacting frequently
As gain confidence system le exception reporting human intervention decrease
Basically computerized model sophisticated computation people serve generator idea developer system
For example study market dynamic establish complex relationship factor forecast forecasting system
Further consumer simulation model become commonplace
The model predict behavior consumer forecast reaction various marketing strategy pricing promotion new product introduction competitive action
Probabilistic model used frequently forecasting process
Finally computerized forecasting relate analytical technique described article
Computer application mostly established stable product business
Although forecasting technique thus far used primarily sale forecasting applied increasingly forecasting margin capital expenditure important factor
This free forecaster spend time forecasting sale profit new product
Doubtless new analytical technique developed forecasting continuing problem least year probably much longer accurately forecasting various factor sale profitability length life cycle
With understanding basic feature limitation technique decision maker help forecaster formulate forecasting problem properly therefore confidence forecast provided use effectively
The forecaster turn must blend technique knowledge experience manager
The need today believe better forecasting method better application technique hand

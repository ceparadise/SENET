If ever chance visit hydroelectric plant one country major dam
One impressive Robert Moses Niagara power plant New York State
This power plant generates million kilowatt AC power
That billion watt enough power light million light bulb
On end spectrum consider standard digital watch run microwatts millionth watt DC power
That small enough tiny button battery watch last year normal usage
Each example represents type electrical power
The dam produce alternating current AC power button cell produce direct current DC power
Let get definition
simplest
A constant voltage available push electric charge circuit
Depending electrical resistance encountered current produced
The current flow one direction
This combination constant voltage current converted point form energy usually mechanical energy heat
DC power simply product voltage current watt W required supply converted energy
This equation written DC electrical power similar mechanical power generated riding bike point A point B
Let say distance one mile
The power required depends much time take travel distance
The faster accomplish task speed power required
Because hill friction provided road take certain amount force pedal achieve certain speed
The force apply pedal like voltage
The speed achieved bike like current
If double force pedal double speed pedal rotate thus double speed bike assuming change gear
What power
It turn measure power bike example much way DC circuit
If multiply force apply pedal speed achieved bike get measure much energy per unit time take get point A point B speed desire
That power
If know two three variable DC circuit voltage current resistance always calculate DC power
The two handy equation Suppose battery connected halogen headlight internal resistance ohm
How much electrical power delivered headlight
DC power used lower voltage application portability important
Most application call battery DC
The following table depicts us DC power As see vehicle headlight produce voltage volt power watt
Not extreme right
Well see lunar rover moon motor operates volt power watt
There many variation device use
Next time see high voltage transmission line take closer look
You probably see set three main line possibly smaller wire either three
Often see two system parallel three line side tower
These three line plus smaller ground wire represent type AC power called simply mean three independent AC power system operate balanced manner
Get FREE access day create account
In Thomas Edison others advocated DC power across
It first practical AC system demonstrated
It turn AC power much easier generate result rotating machine like water turbine easier use industrial application mainly motor
AC use transmit electrical power around globe
Once power get closer user like house neighborhood usually separated individual AC line mean one AC circuit voltage reduced usable level using transformer
In neighborhood might power pole look like image screen right unless power underground By time AC power get house generally available plus couple circuit thing like oven dryer central
AC power result voltage current constant cycle positive negative completing round trip time per second
A good illustration think pendulum moving back forth
If let right side clock represent positive position pendulum left side represent negative obtain approximate diagram pendulum movement time see screen right The pendulum movement approximately sine wave waveform voltage current AC circuit
still defined product voltage current bit complicated mathematically
Without going much detail one fairly simple AC power calculation consider
Suppose interested power consumption electric heater
A heater example act pretty much like resistor convert voltage current heat
With purely resistive load light another good example calculate power using average voltage average current resistance follows The average value voltage current found multiplying peak value sine wave voltage current
A industrial heater supplied AC voltage peak value
The internal resistance heater ohm
What electrical power converted heater
AC power typically used higher voltage application portability issue
The following table depicts common us AC power As see many example use lot power clothes dryer
That try load possible
It also mom always telling leave light leave room
The amount power produced toaster also explains paying attention end blackened cinder make toast morning
Electrical power occurs whenever electrical energy converted form energy heat mechanical energy
common low voltage application portability important
It calculated product voltage current watt two handy form equation
The equation use calculate DC current flow For quick refresher voltage measure volt v power measured watt w current flow measured amp
take couple form also calculated product voltage current
consists three independent balanced AC circuit easy generate used transmission long distance well industrial motor
type AC power used high voltage application household
If load purely use DC power equation AC long use average voltage average current
The average value peak value voltage current sine wave
To calculate power consumed device need square average voltage divide resistance measured ohm

activity make available use
The general deployment process consists several interrelated activity possible transition
These activity occur side side
Because every software system unique precise within activity hardly defined
Therefore deployment interpreted customized according specific requirement characteristic
A brief description activity presented later
When computer extremely large expensive bulky software often bundled together hardware manufacturer
If needed installed existing computer might require expensive visit
For complex installation today still sometimes case
However development software new age came new form software distribution first later
This meant software deployment could left customer
However also increasingly recognised time configurability software customer important ideally interface rather example requiring customer edit registry entry Windows
In software deployment deployment closely related cousin new software release necessity expensive infrequent bulky affair
It arguable therefore spread internet made possible
Indeed advent meant software could deployed large number customer minute internet
This also meant typically deployment schedule determined software supplier customer
Such flexibility led rise viable option especially le risky
The complexity variability software product fostered emergence specialized role coordinating engineering deployment process
For desktop system frequently also become software deployers install software package machine
The deployment involves many role role typically change application progress test production environment
Typical role involved software deployment enterprise application may include

In previous week first asked select system software application specify requirement develop design using modeling tool formulate development testing strategy propose integration deployment plan
Each week contributed specification plan culminated overall Key Assignment System Requirements Design Implementation Specification follows Make update first week content based feedback instructor peer
Make sure Key Assignment good flow cohesive presentation information
In final week given assignment craft integration deployment plan selected application system includes required resource work breakdown structure implementation task may use Visio Software Application needed

realization application execution idea
In implementation realization algorithm
Many implementation may exist given specification standard
For example contain implementation specification software development tool contain implementation
A special case occurs implement case concrete class interface includes method specified interface
In implementation refers process guiding client purchase use software hardware purchased
This includes requirement analysis scope analysis customizations system integration user policy user training delivery
These step often overseen project manager using methodology
Software Implementations involve several professional relatively new knowledge based economy project manager
To implement system successfully large number task need carried appropriate sequence
Utilising implementation methodology enlisting professional advice help often number task poor planning inadequate resourcing cause problem implementation project rather task particularly difficult
Similarly cultural issue often lack adequate consultation communication inhibits achievement desired result
In implementation refers carrying
pas law carried working
This process consists
Factors impacting implementation include legislative intent administrative capacity implementing bureaucracy interest group activity opposition presidential executive support
In international relation implementation refers stage international
It represents stage international provision enacted domestically legislation regulation
The implementation stage different ratification international treaty
Implementation defined specified set activity designed put practice activity program known dimension
According definition implementation process purposeful described sufficient detail independent observer detect presence strength specific set activity related implementation
In addition activity program implemented described sufficient detail independent observer detect presence strength
In water natural resource implementation refers actualization best management practice ultimate goal conserving natural resource improving quality water body
System implementation generally benefit high level user involvement management support
User participation design operation information system several positive result
First user heavily involved system design move opportunity mold system according priority business requirement opportunity control outcome
Second likely react positively change process
Incorporating user knowledge expertise lead better solution
The relationship user information system specialist traditionally problem area information system implementation effort
Users information system specialist tend different background interest priority
This referred communication gap
These difference lead divergent organizational loyalty approach problem solving vocabulary
Examples difference concern

Every website project need deployment plan
The deployment plan outline project get internal development production environment
Unfortunately many case production environment different developer local environment time must allowed handle case
The production environment server hold file ultimately website
Create time QA file local environment
The process QA qualitative analysis involve testing design development along testing functionality
QA create test case test file template
This process take several day depending number use case need verified
Add time deployment plan developer designer fix bug come result QA time
Assess requirement production server
This process occur file development
Get contact information individual charge installation production server
Your developer may need information talk thing technical nature
Allow day transfer file production environment
Note component need moved include database information website file content design source file
In website configuration file developer also need adjust local path production path order reference medium
Create time QA file production environment
Assume need twice much time devoted QA production environment local environment
QA need run test case production environment however error occur production occur local another solution may need done local environment
This mean time needed
Talk client delay occur
Push back deployment timeline client slack getting asset
Be honest client testing going slower expected earlier better
Keep client abreast deployment process

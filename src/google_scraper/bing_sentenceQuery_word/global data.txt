also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

Data scientist might considered many company eager hire data science talent
But year ago term barely used save academic article
Even decade ago explaining data science employer challenging
Few people understood value skill set combine computer science statistic operation research engineering business insight strategy impact business
But thing changed last five year
Not term data science become commonplace data scientist become highly sought marketplace
After data science gave consumer personalized shopping recommendation website like eBay Amazon customized entertainment recommendation Netflix Spotify tailored content advertising Facebook Twitter Pinterest ten million dollar revenue upside business
Over time organization started see value data science volume data analyze increased dramatically
For instance today estimated
Within voluminous quantity data lie insight could enable company gain competitive edge provide better consumer experience many organization made data science top priority
In KPMG survey executive
As study stated Today issue longer owning data rather turn data Which data scientist come
The role data scientist mine enormous volume data pull key insight
In era data expected need expert trained extracting insight data important ever
So problem
We global talent shortage demand data scientist continues grow rapidly far outpacing anemic growth supply
A predicts number data science job United States alone exceed fewer available data scientist fill position
Globally demand data scientist projected exceed supply percent
The global talent drought may partially caused dearth university offer data science program dedicated preparing next generation data scientist
Fewer offer degree data science
Of university offer data science program mere six make available undergraduate rest reserved graduate student
Moreover average cohort size one data science program student
The small cohort size may partially attributed fact data science program tend offered graduate student size graduate program tend smaller
Still student per cohort unlikely make meaningful dent closing global data science talent gap
An analysis curriculum data science program also suggests cause concern
Most focused almost exclusively computer engineering aspect data science course title Software Design Parallel Computing Software Development
Largely missing data science curriculum many university course statistical analysis insight strategy
This oversight may serious consequence graduating student future employer
Without training area data scientist may capable designing algorithm mathematically elegant make strategic sense business
They also may know design experiment determine whether algorithm effective
In word computer science skill alone insufficient success data scientist today marketplace
Furthermore many data science program lack course help student apply technical data science skill field marketing operation product development supply chain industry energy bioinformatics transportation healthcare
While university distinguished curriculum focus aspect data science New York University still far university producing enough graduate meet today growing demand data scientist
There three step take help stem talent shortage Closing global data science talent gap easy critical ensure company ability make strategic decision
If company university work together address problem better prepare student employer success

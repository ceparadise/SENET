The basic idea code procedure grew desire make code efficient
Early linear code program often lacked versatility sophistication would allow complex process code
By using procedure programmer make program one thing many different way using different parameter set data simply invoking procedure different variable attached
In many computer programming language procedure specifically defined various way
The code procedure stored within identifier procedure mark separate larger code
In case procedure part external library called developer library file
In case written customized way within program
The procedure basic building block called object oriented programming brought powerful set tool today developer community

I looking code saw context comment
I think I figured code question involve anything specific
I simply understand term mean applicable programming
I looked around saw mathmatic definition would like information
From I tell Hysteresis something predicting assuming given state X based happened X past
Hysteresis characterizes system whose behavior output depend input time also past behavior followed
A device exhibit hysteresis thermostat
Imagine thermostat would switch heating
When temperature around fluctuating bit thermostat would continually switch heating
Generally thermostat built hysteresis switch heating say switch heating
This avoids continual switch
EDIT look
Thermostat example If one point system coul oscillate around single point
Between point height low depends last value heater
Google friend The principle general refers behavior system change based previous state
Thus model hysteresis state machine diagram graph
In user interface design refers practice making user interface lag behind user input event event
Clicking button might immediately display detail window instead animation started gradually change user interface
I think Device Driver Configured bubble Windows task bar exhibiting hysteresis bubble appears response completion event OS begin fade away
A event user reset timer giving user time click bubble detail event delay fading animation even mouse event thereafter outside region bubble
Good answer
In practical integration layer important
An integration layer hysteresis subsystem
Clearly ideal hysteresis Moore machine typically mismatch state machine system solved translator using hysteresis
For instance Microsoft Plains Field Service module record state Service Master Audit Trail table
Each Call SRVSTAT
When integrating scheduler like ClickSoftware service optimization scheduler one need work state
The state CS determined custom implementation

Open InRoute OnSite Incomplete Cancelled Complete
Additionally also state Incomplete Parts Pending although implemented State Machine within Incomplete
So transition GP must mapped CS
Unfortunately GP allows record screen input call transition one state thus transition event used solely triggering state change GP
Therefore new trigger event combination GP state transition well defined logic set past event
As see hysteresis quickly take problem simple complex
In computer science term ideal Moore Machine practical Mealy Machine
I prefer think like Mealy flour bug living
I think possible produce Moore machine Mealy machine Moore machine simply state
See It also used lot engineering
For example video game logic causing lot switching without good result add hysteresis problem cause object commit particular direction period time avoid twitching issue
Similar done electronics Schmidt trigger avoid constant switching push system new state cause system vibrate one state able get
Very simple concept helpful
Search hysteresis youtube example
Without hysteresis robot game would literally twitch around hardly move lot activity going

This online detailed current practical tour science treatment muscle pain trigger point muscle knot patient professional
What controversy myth muscle pain
What work muscle pain
Get many troubleshooting idea even toughest case popular readable modern famous Travell text realistic honest source
Many people suffer sensitive spot muscle known And yet rocket science
You need good selection rational option creative tip trick insight perspective based recent science year clinical experience
Trigger point therapy experimental bit crapshoot yet learning even little trigger point solve many pain problem easily
If feel like problem stubborn unexplained aching stiffness really
please keep reading
Does body feel like toxic waste dump
It may literally true realized
Some evidence show knot may patch polluted tissue nasty little cesspool waste metabolite
If wonder hurt wonder cause many strange sensation like poisoned injured
Back pain best known symptom common muscle knot cause astonishing array ache pain
Misdiagnosis much common diagnosis
Trigger point therapy good true ordinary good
It definitely miraculous
It experimental often fails
Good trigger point therapy hard find even define
But also potential quickly cheaply safely help many common pain problem respond well anything else
This massive tutorial written patient professional
It includes analysis recent research find text crafted suit skill level
Footnotes add optional layer advanced detail take leave
Trigger point clinically important health professional realize body pain seems growing problem
It rewarding topic doctor therapist make clear path helping quite people probably help
Even already know get new idea
average muscle pain typical case nagging hip pain advice given may well almost miraculously useful
I get avalanche email reader thanking pointing simple treatment option irritating problem
Many stunned discovery chronic pain could treated easily along
already tried failed treat trigger point document especially made
You learn try giving
This get close cure get I give fighting chance least taking edge pain
And maybe bit miracle
When say muscle knot talking There actual knot involved course feel like
Although true nature uncertain main theory trigger point small patch tightly contracted muscle isolated spasm affecting tiny patch muscle tissue spasm like charlie horse
In theory small patch muscle choke blood supply irritates even vicious cycle called metabolic The swampy metabolic situation I like think syndrome
A trigger point usually annoyance
Many bad one syndrome
TrPs vicious
They cause far discomfort people believe possible
Its bark much louder bite bark extremely loud
It also surprisingly bark trigger point generate odd sensation
Muscle pain matter important problem
Aches pain extremely common medical complaint trigger point seem factor many
They key factor headache possibly including migraine cluster headache well neck pain low back pain much
What make trigger point clinically important fascinating triple threat
They Trigger point cause pain
Trigger point natural part muscle tissue
Just almost everyone get pimple sooner later almost everyone get muscle knot get pain explanation issue
Trigger point injury painful problem
They show like party crasher
Whatever wrong count make many case actually begin overshadow original problem
Trigger point problem
Many trigger point feel like something else
It easy unsuspecting health professional mistake trigger point pain For instance muscle pain probably common repetitive strain injury RSIs many RSIs may actually muscle pain
A perfect example
The daily clinical experience thousand massage therapist physical therapist physician strongly indicates common ache pain many puzzling physical complaint actually caused small contraction knot muscle body
Clair Davies I apply MythBusters approach health care without explosive
I claim The Answer trigger point
When I know I admit
I I explain science behind key point footnote drawn I link source
For instance good evidence educational tutorial actually effective medicine pain
Good information good medicine
Unfortunately good information challenge trigger point
The science bit shabby
They
They
They diagnosis exactly solid foundation either critic dismissed entire concept
None though muscle pain still important topic trigger point useful label whatever going everyone agrees painful going
So reason rational tour guide take murky subject
What useful theory trigger point
What obsolete
Who disagrees
idea turn okay long stay oven
Trigger point science may bit hot mess also
Family doctor really equipped troubleshooting chronic pain
Muscle orphan organ
No medical speciality claim Muscle tissue largest organ body complex vulnerable dysfunction primary target wear tear daily activity nevertheless bone joint bursa nerve physician usually concentrate Family doctor particularly uninformed cause musculoskeletal ache pain simply radar
They busy lot thing many quite dire
As serious muscle pain minor compared say diabetes heart disease
And also harder topic seems surface
So really surprising doctor exactly muscle pain treatment Jedi
They may best option serious case
Doctors pain clinic tend know trigger point
But also often limit treatment method exclusively injection therapy bazooka kill mouse
anything le really epic chronic pain qualify admittance pain clinic first place
This option available patient trigger point truly horrid primary problem major complication
Medical specialist may know quite bit muscle pain helpful average patient
An appallingly high percentage doctor practitioner still pretty much loop regarding trigger point
Clair Davies often preoccupied fault joint function biomechanics exercise therapy
These approach place often emphasized expense understanding muscle pain easily afflict people apparently perfect body posture fitness
A lot patient time get wasted trying straighten patient along little pressure key muscle knot might provided relief
lot experience muscle tissue know surprisingly little myofascial pain syndrome
Their training standard vary wildly
Even three year training RMT longest program world I learned basic barely introduction
Like physical therapist chiropractor massage therapist often almost absurdly preoccupied symmetry structure
The right hand give lot relief hard find right hand
No professional kind skilled treatment trigger point
Muscle tissue simply gotten clinical attention deserves misdiagnosis wrong treatment like death tax inevitable
And tutorial exists help save educate professional
Those clinician become skilled diagnosing managing myofascial trigger point frequently see patient referred practitioner last resort
These patient commonly arrive long list diagnostic procedure none satisfactorily explained cause relieved patient pain
Janet Travell David Simons Lois Simons The Big Red Books text book therapist treating trigger point
In addition many scientific paper tutorial based medical textbook like massive set big red book blue book These easy reading
They contain answer indeed contain nonsense anyone claim treat muscle pain still big red book book office
They historically important
So see copy ask fair effective polite way check therapist competence
blue one important
I highly recommend professional work muscle
It recent cover wider range soft tissue pain issue putting trigger point context
illness hurting widespread chronic pain decreased pain threshold
It also associated fatigue sleep disturbance fibro fog mental confusion
It defined symptom know actually cause people pain one FM Here good primer fibromyalgia Although unexplained FM clearly neurological disease MPS may problem muscle tissue
It would nice clear distinction established someday
FM MPS imperfect imprecise label closely related set unexplained symptom make harder tell apart mischievous twin deliberately impersonate
They may two side painful coin overlapping part spectrum sensory malfunction different process
Some case effectively impossible tell apart
There may real difference FM severe MPS
Add fact condition controversial point people deny even exist understandable get confused
Note tender point fibromyalgia thing trigger point
Whatever cause label therapeutic approach MPS seems helpful FM patient well although pure FM case seem mostly immune massage
But book still useful many FM patient insofar overlap main topic
Taylor advice medical cause pain especially helpful wife also doctor fibromyalgia gotten considerable relief recommendation shared
So fibromyalgia book I certainly hope interest fibromyalgia patient
This trigger point really get interesting
In addition minor ache pain muscle pain often cause unusual symptom strange location
For instance many people diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome actually experiencing pain caused muscle armpit subscapularis
Seriously
I making
This odd phenomenon pain spreading trigger point another location called referred The neurology explained detail
Here example interesting referred pain leading misdiagnosis Sometimes trigger point cause severe symptom mistaken medical emergency
I treated man chest arm pain hospital several hour checked sign heart failure got office symptom relieved minute rubbing pectoralis major muscle trigger point
The trigger point sometimes raise fear tumor
Here particularly excellent example sent physician experience I narrowly escaped breast biopsy trigger point pectoralis major
I bad chest pain month
I table permit signed draped
The doctor sure said wanted another mammogram
I left confused relieved still hurting
Then I lucked regular internist puzzled thought might soft That made go physical therapist
The physical therapist pulled big red book trigger point read together
Treatment complete success
A severe pain I treating ice pack bra gone
Janice Kregor competitive swimmer retired pediatrician medical school instructor Another client spent three day hospital severe abdominal pain doctor diagnose pain mostly quickly relieved massaging trigger point psoas major muscle
I suffered dramatic case toothache completely relieved massage therapist day emergency appointment dentist particularly vivid experience
However vast majority symptom caused myofascial pain syndrome simply familiar ache pain humanity million sore back shoulder neck
Some become quite serious
Is like
Muscle knot pain savage
Over year I met many people much pain muscle dysfunction could hardly think straight
Is muscle pain trivial
Not
The relationship trigger point pain often straightforward therapy nearly effortless
One nice thing working trigger point sometimes make like miracle worker clinical slam dunk garden variety persistent pain pain undiagnosed untreated string health professional
For instance Lois McConnell Vancouver came see complaining moderate chronic back pain several year
She received common misdiagnoses particularly sacroiliac joint dysfunction
But prominent gluteus maximus trigger point stimulated felt exactly like symptom deep ache region low back upper gluteals
In three appointment pain completely relieved
She quite pleased I tell
Just wanted give quick update Unbelievable perhaps considering I learned
A big thank help
Lois McConnell retired airline executive suffered chronic low back hip pain year Jan developed hip pain sometime early period intense exercising
The pain quickly grew point interfering walking medically diagnosed bursitis piriformis strain arthritis
I believe likely treated trigger point piriformis muscle June
Her symptom relieved eight month slowly began reassert trigger point often despite best effort come
One trigger point therapy treatment completely relieved nasty stubborn hip pain I five month
Jan Campbell retired French language teacher Palm Springs recovered easily several month hip pain Every trigger point therapist seemingly endless list treatment success story
Although case involve relatively minor symptom say minor problem
In almost every case pain relatively mild extremely frustrating persistent many year relieved easily handful treatment incredible thing think
So much unnecessary suffering
Can good enough massage therapist remove trigger point session
Is thing trigger point whisperer
I got question email show common theme quest mystique magic super therapist fix anything two three session
Or even le
The idea annoyance honest humble professional know better le impossible believe know basic pain muscle knot
The skill therapist relatively minor factor among affect success massage therapy trigger point therapy pain problem
Trigger point little switch flicked released anyone sufficiently advanced technique mysterious cantankerous complex
Even best therapist defeated situation
And nearly therapist luck get great result occasional patient planet aligned sometimes trigger point respond well virtually intervention
It really depends
For comparison good enough dog trainer train dog hour
Even Cesar Dog Whisperer Millan say dog traumatized sick injured requires hour smart gradual conditioning
It depends situation
This major theme document I dedicated teaching treatment important thing cover introduction
How tell trigger point cause problem
Trigger point many strange feature behaviour easily confused many problem
Because medical obscurity science often thing considered clinical importance many distinctive characteristic
There several thing look help feel confident yes problem instead something else
The next several section discus detail
Whether knew probably already familiar trigger point even never heard starting tutorial
Almost everyone head start trigger point almost everyone already le know like muscle knot
If ever muscle stiffness wrenched neck around trying stretch wiggle way free discomfort gotten friend partner dig annoying spot back trigger point
You pain stiffness feel like muscle

Purchased individually tutorial would cost set price thirteen classic trigger point explored separate article website Perfect Spots massage associated common pain problem
However trigger point chart tend put focus wrong thing people need knowledge sound principle way need diagram
In case lot good free cheap chart
Please buy book demand refund chart like asking refund visit zoo get see cat dog squirrel
But naturally I guarantee result I want
I believe giving false hope trigger point therapy far perfect
My goal give best success help avoid wasting time money bollocksy therapy
If worth I get publishing business
Many specific pain problem mentioned book go detail
Once understand nature trigger point really need spell relationship every common injury
Trigger point cause complicate injury quite predictable way clinically interesting
Clair Amber Davies popular book
It illustrated nicely offer detailed reference material something tutorial actually
The promise much neglect relevant science
This short version I used wonder I even bothered create tutorial
Why recommend
Because tutorial grown offer lot probably never
The strength tutorial delving nature beast science fallen behind time
The edition promise much neglect important new knowledge
Trigger point therapy challenged many scientific disappointment controversy new way understanding pain acknowledge
This topic important neglect
The goal tutorial offer realistic balanced view trigger point therapy meet challenge difficult case head explore every possible treatment potential limit risk
I believe better job ever
This list resource relevant chronic pain general muscle pain particular
I avoided publishing section tutorial many year I generally impressed resource available patient professional especially online resource
I remember slightly testy conversation someone American organization shall rename nameless Years later organization still dozen certified therapist directory yet remains one largest directory kind
If live big city fair middlin chance find one therapist
But certification trigger point therapist generally amateurish fragmented mess many business organization competing standard
Even document part mess part mess hopefully nevertheless good example everyone dog trying provide best field
For inclusion section organization business must defining field way must strong online presence
The relevance listing professional reader patient shown icon
For instance although professional association rarely much interest patient may provide directory professional help patient find practitioner
With apology international reader section mostly
If aware important resource organization elsewhere world please The organization dedicated representing professional specializing myofascial pain trigger point therapy
NAMTPT provides resource patient professional therapist A nonprofit health professional organization dedicated promotion information pain disorder like myofascial pain
IMS publishes
A nonprofit organization train Certified Pain Educators CPEs
A CPE educates clinical peer patient family caregiver way relieve pain safest mean possible
ASPE training focused muscle pain
The largest association pain professional United States member
Similar ASPE member focus muscle pain particular included chronic pain expert general although interestingly
They provide listing pain clinic
A nonprofit organization advance profession massage therapy founded
The MTF website strong focus research publish routinely publishes paper myofascial pain syndrome
Their offer series excellent short ebooks author I know vouch I particularly recommend Tracy Walton written therapist
The best oldest American manufacturer good quality Pressure Positive also superb corporate citizen contributing advancement trigger point therapy many way collaborating writer like supporting promoting scientific research admirable quality field often afflicted pseudoscientific hype
Their website provides many useful resource patient professional
A small trigger point workshop provider professional patient notable mainly founder Amber Davies NCTMB daughter Clair Davies author popular primer topic see
A small professional organization trigger point therapist dedicated advancing professional standard myofascial trigger point therapist establishment maintenance criterion procedure They offer modest directory dozen trigger point therapist around United States
Neil Asher Technique branded approach trigger point therapy website mostly built around
Simons famous seminal text myofascial pain syndrome Janet Travell
DGSA named honour offered course dry needling manual trigger point therapy worldwide since although seem primarily serving Europe
They hardly provider workshop I single I specifically appreciate attitude towards certification offer teach certification level branded treatment I necessarily object branding training I prefer academic approach training
They maintain decent bibliography
See also offering trigger point course Spain led Orlando Mayoral regular exchange experience DGSA Orlando Mayoral
A continuing education company focusing myofascial trigger point manual trigger point therapy dry needling trigger point injection
Like DSGA Myopain Seminars focused teaching skill knowledge branded certification program directory graduate course see feature provide diagnostic management service pain patient may interest many reader book
I friendly occasional correspondence founder Jan Dommerholt author several influential book paper topic although necessarily agree everything I fan dry needling primarily I think mentor learned great deal
Testimonials health care website reek quackery publishing always made bit queasy
But testimonial mostly I selling I hope make difference
So highlight kind word I received plus criticism I receive people ask refund happen much
I enjoyed trigger point tutorial read whole thing last Friday
I also sent two friend problem
It education site armed valuable
Melinda Alltree Vancouver I purchased recently got free trigger point one also
Many thanks
They great
I already accessed working trigger point
I much better idea whole ghastly business
Leah Brannen Saskatoon Canada I bought two eBooks last week I enjoying going
It far early say course I think I already begun benefit approach
One thing I like approach respect science opposed You put much two eBooks going take time justice deserve
David Calderisi Toronto Ontario One trigger point therapy treatment completely relieved nasty stubborn hip pain I five month
Jan Campbell retired French language teacher Palm Springs recovered easily several month hip pain You saved look information I desperately seeking trigger point basic massage technique
I found info educational entertaining appreciated wit well
I surprised discover Canadian I always enjoyed Canadian sense humor
Laura Gallagher Outstanding excellent work
I really want commend
I teach trigger point I recommending tutorial student
Thanks much
John Harris medical massage therapy instructor Santa Barbara I suffering lower back pain last week found page informative interesting
I really thank enough actually first time I really starting feel like I right track
Glenn Hill Canterbury Australia I really enjoying trigger point tutorial
It great lot extra professional information work
I found serious shortage information web given clear quality conveyed introduction
Daniel Jalkut software developer Somerville Massachusetts regard whole website book submitted London physician specializing link excellent blog I writing congratulate thank impressive ongoing review musculoskeletal research
I teach course Leonards Hospital Hoxton
I originally stumbled across website whilst looking information pain medical student

Daniel Jalkut software developer Somerville Massachusetts Oh I get
I many reason emailed constructive criticism factual correction request suggestion welcome
I made many important change tutorial inspired directly critical informed reader feedback
But make everyone happy
Some people demand money back get
I refund rate far better average
The complaint disatisfied customer strong theme This document many year created spare time lot assistance family friend
Undying thanks wife Kimberly countless indulgence large small editor girlfriend parent possibly blind faith much copyediting Mike Gobbi buddy digital mentor many nifty feature document hidden obvious
And thanks many others many many answer think email
Thanks finally every reader client customer big tipper curiosity faith feedback suggestion story
Without And thanks health professional particularly inspiring Dr
Rob Tarzwell
Thank finally Tim Taylor MD author book vital section new summer
More collaborator Tim idealistic decisive volunteer offer contribute book made happen quickly well sake helping people
In twenty year writing publishing I never seen collaboration go smoothly I extremely grateful
Regular update key feature tutorial
As new science information becomes available I upgrade recent version always automatically available customer
Unlike regular book even obsolete time published go year edition document updated least every three month often much
I also update making easy reader see changed
This tutorial gotten major minor update since I started logging carefully late plus countless minor tweak
anyone care take look
The popular trigger point book patient still Clair Amber Davies
Unfortunately scientifically weak first edition published still new edition
It ignores important scientific finding controversy last year promise much
Many people written year tell really trick tutorial
The quality limitation
Rocket science difficult
It brain surgery
rocket scientist It amazingly difficult find hard data prevalence musculoskeletal problem
However Australian study medical student found almost kind body pain problem mostly neck lower back shoulder young people
It may exaggeration say musculoskeletal pain
Although research preliminary uncontrolled powerful enough prove anything result certainly noteworthy sort result inspire research hopefully
All patient chronic cluster headache kind severe primary headache nicknamed suicide headache myofascial trigger point treating injection produced significant improvement chronic cluster The author speculate trigger point cause cluster headache nasty complicating factor chronic pain repeated acute pain sensitize muscular nociceptors creating active trigger point turn contribute potentiate headache pain
This kind vicious cycle explains number active trigger point found higher patient chronic primary headache healthy subject patient experiencing le frequent headache Estimates incidence repetitive strain injury generally range case requiring time away work
In comparison MPS ubiquitous
In clinical experience treating RSIs represent negligible fraction work whereas MPS either cause complicating factor nearly every case I treat including RSIs
In Interiors Sources magazine reported total number serious injury illness attributed repetitive motion four percent total number case requiring time away work
Of majority case percent recorded manufacturing sector Clearly repetitive motion injury occurring office America said PJ Edington executive director Center Office Technology COT
And epidemic repetitive motion injury reported medium clear case Quintner Cohen Bove think popular theory nature trigger point muscle tissue lesion flawed reasoning science treatment based idea get result indistinguishable placebo They argue biological evidence put forward year critically flawed evidence lead elsewhere take position debate
They also point theory treated like established fact great many people definitely problematic
However opinion extreme expert think throw science far see
See This controversial opinion discussed detail later
Here Fred Wolfe technical readable definition fibromyalgia blog post
Wolfe rheumatologist long history expertise trigger point fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia name given clinical syndrome whose main feature currently presence together multiple somatic symptom
In particular among common symptom
Decreased pain threshold almost always found strongly correlated extent body pain
Because symptom intensity variable
The identification fibromyalgia based overall severity symptom
The gold standard necessary severity set American College Rheumatology ACR criterion roughly level symptom found person tender point examined capable examiner
As fibromyalgia symptom le criterion level often found fibromyalgia diagnosed uncertain fibromyalgia begin
There consistent clinical laboratory imaging abnormality
When one tuberculosis one tuberculosis whether diagnosed
The true cancer rheumatoid arthritis hookworm infestation really gamut disease
But fibromyalgia FM
This review massage therapy fibromyalgia epitomizes garbage garbage problem virtually research topic worth analyzing begin trying pool result several weak study meaningless
To extent study result generally inconclusive ambiguous conclusion review going author opinion bias hard data
In case report significant positive result without mentioning mean statistically significant effect size clinically insignificant
They also boast traditional Chinese massage abstract odd
And fail note much data even measure effect pain mood
So conclusion
There really nothing except maybe massage fibromyalgia damned faint ambiguous praise
I written several paragraph paper This study compared healthy woman others temporomandibular disorder TMD
Trained examiner looked trigger point without knowing group specifically neck jaw muscle
According criterion used found worse trigger point woman TMD worse I mean larger area referred pain
The trigger point neck produced referred pain jaw muscle
There footnote full version book
I like footnote I try fun

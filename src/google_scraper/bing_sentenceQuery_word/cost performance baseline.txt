The cost baseline basis earned value reporting system
It budget estimated cost project spread time period project
As noted Chapter managing project concerned three baseline schedule baseline cost baseline scope baseline
These three baseline comprise goal project deliver stakeholder asked time predicted money estimated
The cost baseline part project concerned amount money project predicted cost money used
The three baseline closely related change one result change others
If change made project scope baseline either adding removing work required schedule baseline cost baseline probably changed well
It foolish manager change project scope without considering effect budget schedule yet done project manager time
In order develop cost project complete project plan necessary definitive detailed cost estimate activity project
The cost planned activity spread time operational budget sometimes called performance budget
Some care must exercised planning cost baseline
Since basis performance measurement system must careful budget shown cost baseline point time expect actual cost occur
This quite problem
Suppose show budgeted expenditure item purchasing particular date say April
To project management planner date project team completes work make purchase take place
In word project team decides need purchase issue purchase requisition purchasing department actually buy
The actual expenditure time money actually spent time company actually issue check company supplying part project team might several month later
Because time delay actual cost budgeted cost several month
This course effect making performance report look better
If many delay reporting actual cost project entire project may look much better really
Of course sooner later actual cost shown
Then project performance suddenly fall
The cost baseline enough money get project done
In addition work identified work planned
This unplanned work result risk took
Some risk project identified planned others come complete surprise
We discus risk management Chapter
Risks project work activity probability associated
The probability measure likelihood done course project
The risk identified must estimated cost associated well probability
Multiplied together result expected value risk
For example suppose risk percent paint project adhere properly strip repaint
If cost repair would make much sense budget project risk
If project would greatly budgeted
While indeed cost make repair necessary budget expected value percent
If project painted acceptably first time extra project risk budget spend
Since project many risk result extra cost work others
If estimate probability impact correct end project budget risk end equal total expected value risk actually took place project
This take care identified risk risk came surprise anticipated
These risk unidentified risk project must budgeted well
Unfortunately budget risk going bit guess
We rely past experience similar project come estimate
These budget unknown unidentified risk generally estimated roughly percentage total project
The percentage quite small however
Where budget unknown risk higher small percentage project cost chance risk identification process poorly done many risk could identified
In case budget unknown risk frequently inflated way compensating lack identification
A much better solution would spend time identifying risk identified evaluating properly setting aside small amount budget unknown risk

amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

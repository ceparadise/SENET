It important point value considered involved asset value directly affected resource
For example consider risk scenario threat consider value data related asset contained computer reputation liability company asset deriving lost availability confidentiality data could involved
It easy understand data reputation liability worth much physical resource risk laptop hardware example
Intangible asset value huge easy evaluate consideration pure quantitative approach
Qualitative risk assessment three five step evaluation Very High Low performed organization requires risk assessment performed relatively short time meet small budget significant quantity relevant data available person performing assessment sophisticated mathematical financial risk assessment expertise required
Qualitative risk assessment performed shorter period time le data
Qualitative risk assessment typically performed interview sample personnel relevant group within organization charged security asset assessed
Qualitative risk assessment descriptive versus measurable
Usually qualitative classification done followed quantitative evaluation highest risk compared cost security measure
Risk estimation input output risk analysis split following step The output list risk value level assigned

identification assessment prioritization defined followed coordinated economical application resource minimize monitor control probability impact unfortunate event maximize realization opportunity
Risk management objective assure deflect endeavor business goal
Risks come various source including uncertainty financial market threat project failure phase design development production sustainment legal liability credit risk accident deliberate attack adversary event uncertain unpredictable
There two type event
negative event classified risk positive event classified opportunity
Several risk management developed including actuarial society ISO standard
Methods definition goal vary widely according whether risk management method context project management security financial portfolio actuarial assessment public health safety
Strategies manage threat uncertainty negative consequence typically include avoiding threat reducing negative effect probability threat transferring part threat another party even retaining potential actual consequence particular threat opposite opportunity uncertain future state benefit
Certain aspect many risk management standard come criticism measurable improvement risk whereas confidence estimate decision seem increase
For example one study found one six IT project gigantic overrun cost overrun averaged schedule overrun
A widely used vocabulary risk management defined Risk management
Vocabulary
In ideal risk management prioritization process followed whereby risk greatest loss impact greatest occurring handled first risk lower probability occurrence lower loss handled descending order
In practice process assessing overall risk difficult balancing resource used mitigate risk high probability occurrence lower loss versus risk high loss lower probability occurrence often mishandled
Intangible risk management identifies new type risk probability occurring ignored organization due lack identification ability
For example deficient knowledge applied situation risk materializes
Relationship risk appears ineffective collaboration occurs
risk may issue ineffective operational procedure applied
These risk directly reduce productivity knowledge worker decrease profitability service quality reputation brand value earnings quality
Intangible risk management allows risk management create immediate value identification reduction risk reduce productivity
Risk management also face difficulty allocating resource
This idea
Resources spent risk management could spent profitable activity
Again ideal risk management minimizes spending manpower resource also minimizes negative effect risk
According definition risk risk possibility event occur adversely affect achievement objective
Therefore risk uncertainty
Risk management COSO ERM help manager good control risk
Each company may different internal control component lead different outcome
For example framework ERM component includes Internal Environment Objective Setting Event Identification Risk Assessment Risk Response Control Activities Information Communication Monitoring
For part method consist following element performed le following order
The ISO identifies following principle risk management Risk management According standard Risk management Principles guideline implementation process risk management consists several step follows This involves After establishing context next step process managing risk identify potential risk
Risks event triggered cause problem benefit
Hence risk identification start source problem competitor benefit problem
Examples risk source stakeholder project employee company weather airport
When either source problem known event source may trigger event lead problem investigated
For example stakeholder withdrawing project may endanger funding project confidential information may stolen employee even within closed network lightning striking aircraft takeoff may make people board immediate casualty
The chosen method identifying risk may depend culture industry practice compliance
The identification method formed template development template identifying source problem event
Common risk identification method Once risk identified must assessed potential severity impact generally negative impact damage loss probability occurrence
These quantity either simple measure case value lost building impossible know sure case unlikely event probability occurrence unknown
Therefore assessment process critical make best educated decision order properly prioritize implementation
Even positive improvement negative impact
Take turnpike example
A highway widened allow traffic
More traffic capacity lead greater development area surrounding improved traffic capacity
Over time traffic thereby increase fill available capacity
Turnpikes thereby need expanded seemingly endless cycle
There many engineering example expanded capacity function soon filled increased demand
Since expansion come cost resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting management
The fundamental difficulty risk assessment determining rate occurrence since statistical information available kind past incident particularly scanty case catastrophic event simply infrequency
Furthermore evaluating severity consequence impact often quite difficult intangible asset
Asset valuation another question need addressed
Thus best educated opinion available statistic primary source information
Nevertheless risk assessment produce information senior executive organization primary risk easy understand risk management decision may prioritized within overall company goal
Thus several theory attempt quantify risk
Numerous different risk formula exist perhaps widely accepted formula risk quantification Rate probability occurrence multiplied impact event equal risk magnitude
Risk mitigation measure usually formulated according one following major risk option Later research shown financial benefit risk management le dependent formula used dependent frequency risk assessment performed
In business imperative able present finding risk assessment financial market schedule term
Robert Courtney IBM proposed formula presenting risk financial term
The Courtney formula accepted official risk analysis method US governmental agency
The formula proposes calculation ALE annualized loss expectancy compare expected loss value security control implementation cost
Once risk identified assessed technique manage risk fall one four major category Ideal use may possible
Some may involve acceptable organization person making risk management decision
Another source US Department Defense see link call category ACAT Avoid Control Accept Transfer
This use ACAT acronym reminiscent another ACAT Acquisition Category used US Defense industry procurement Risk Management figure prominently decision making planning
This includes performing activity could carry risk
An example would buying business order take come
Another would flying order take risk
Avoidance may seem answer risk avoiding risk also mean losing potential gain accepting retaining risk may allowed
Not entering business avoid risk loss also avoids possibility earning profit
Increasing risk regulation hospital led avoidance treating higher risk condition favor patient presenting lower risk
Risk reduction optimization involves reducing severity loss likelihood loss occurring
For example designed put reduce risk loss fire
This method may cause greater loss water damage therefore may suitable
fire suppression system may mitigate risk cost may prohibitive
Acknowledging risk positive negative optimizing risk mean finding balance negative risk benefit operation activity risk reduction effort applied
By offshore drilling contractor effectively applying HSE management organization optimize risk achieve level tolerable
Modern software development methodology reduce risk developing delivering software incrementally
Early methodology suffered fact delivered software final phase development problem encountered earlier phase meant costly rework often jeopardized whole project
By developing iteration software project limit effort wasted single iteration
could example risk reduction outsourcer demonstrate higher capability managing reducing risk
For example company may outsource software development manufacturing hard good customer support need another company handling business management
This way company concentrate business development without worry much manufacturing process managing development team finding physical location call center
Briefly defined sharing another party burden loss benefit gain risk measure reduce risk
The term transfer often used place risk sharing mistaken belief transfer risk third party insurance outsourcing
In practice insurance company contractor go bankrupt end court original risk likely still revert first party
As terminology practitioner scholar alike purchase insurance contract often described transfer risk
However technically speaking buyer contract generally retains legal responsibility loss transferred meaning insurance may described accurately compensatory mechanism
For example personal injury insurance policy transfer risk car accident insurance company
The risk still lie policy holder namely person accident
The insurance policy simply provides accident event occurs involving policy holder compensation may payable policy holder commensurate
Some way managing risk fall multiple category
Risk retention pool technically retaining risk group spreading whole group involves transfer among individual member group
This different traditional insurance premium exchanged member group front instead loss assessed member group
Involves accepting loss benefit gain risk occurs
True fall category
Risk retention viable strategy small risk cost insuring risk would greater time total loss sustained
All risk avoided transferred retained default
This includes risk large catastrophic either insured premium would infeasible
example since property risk insured war loss attributed war retained insured
Also amount potential loss risk amount insured retained risk
This may also acceptable chance large loss small cost insure greater coverage amount great would hinder goal organization much
Select appropriate control countermeasure measure risk
Risk mitigation need approved appropriate level management
For instance risk concerning image organization top management decision behind whereas IT management would authority decide computer virus risk
The risk management plan propose applicable effective security control managing risk
For example observed high risk computer virus could mitigated acquiring implementing antivirus software
A good risk management plan contain schedule control implementation responsible person action
According stage immediately completion phase consists preparing Risk Treatment Plan document decision identified risk handled
Mitigation risk often mean selection documented Statement Applicability identifies particular control objective control standard selected
Implementation follows planned method mitigating effect risk
Purchase insurance policy risk decided transferred insurer avoid risk avoided without sacrificing entity goal reduce others retain rest
Initial risk management plan never perfect
Practice experience actual loss result necessitate change plan contribute information allow possible different decision made dealing risk faced
result management plan updated periodically
There two primary reason Prioritizing highly could keep organization ever completing project even getting started
This especially true work suspended risk management process considered complete
It also important keep mind distinction risk
Risk measured impact probability
If risk improperly assessed prioritized time wasted dealing risk loss likely occur
Spending much time assessing managing unlikely risk divert resource could used profitably
Unlikely event occur risk unlikely enough occur may better simply retain risk deal result loss fact occur
Qualitative risk assessment subjective lack consistency
The primary justification formal risk assessment process legal bureaucratic
As applied technique measuring monitoring controlling financial firm traditional measure VaR also measure like PaR
The framework break risk price risk operational risk also specifies method calculating component
In Information Technology Risk management includes Incident Handling action plan dealing intrusion denial service fire flood event
According six step process Preparation Identification Containment Eradication Recovery Lessons Learned
In enterprise risk management risk defined possible event circumstance negative influence enterprise question
Its impact existence resource human capital product service customer enterprise well external impact society market environment
In financial institution enterprise risk management normally thought combination credit risk liquidity risk market risk operational risk
In general case every probable risk plan deal possible consequence ensure risk becomes
From information average cost per employee time project manager estimate Risk due either requires appropriate treatment
That concern extremal case equivalent list immediately
For medical device risk management process identifying evaluating mitigating risk associated harm people damage property environment
Risk management integral part medical device design development production process evaluation field experience applicable type medical device
The evidence application required regulatory body
The management risk medical device described International Organization Standardization ISO ISO Medical application risk management medical device product safety standard
The standard provides process framework associated requirement management responsibility risk analysis evaluation risk control lifecycle risk management
The European version risk management standard updated refer Medical Devices Directive MDD Active Implantable Medical Device Directive AIMDD revision well In Vitro Medical Device Directive IVDD
The requirement EN nearly identical ISO
The difference include three informative Z Annexes refer new MDD AIMDD IVDD
These annex indicate content deviation include requirement risk reduced requirement risk mitigated design labeling medical device labeling longer used mitigate risk
Typical risk analysis evaluation technique adopted medical device industry include FTA FMEA hazard operability study risk traceability analysis ensuring risk control implemented effective
tracking risk identified product requirement design specification verification validation result etc
FTA analysis requires diagramming software
FMEA analysis done using program
There also integrated medical device risk management solution
Through FDA introduced another method named Safety Assurance Case medical device safety assurance analysis
The safety assurance case structured argument reasoning system appropriate scientist engineer supported body evidence provides compelling comprehensible valid case system safe given application given environment
With guidance safety assurance case expected safety critical device

In FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturer submit cybersecurity risk analysis information
Project risk management must considered different phase acquisition
In beginning project advancement technical development threat presented competitor project may cause risk threat assessment subsequent evaluation alternative see
Once decision made project begun familiar project management application used sometimes also called major program investment project typically costing billion per project
Megaprojects include major bridge tunnel highway railway airport seaport power plant dam wastewater project coastal flood protection scheme oil natural gas extraction project public building information technology system aerospace project defense system
Megaprojects shown particularly risky term finance safety social environmental impact
Risk management therefore particularly pertinent megaprojects special method special education developed risk management
It important ass risk regard natural disaster like
Outcomes natural disaster risk assessment valuable considering future repair cost business interruption loss downtime effect environment insurance cost proposed cost reducing risk
There regular deal integral risk management
risk related information technology

framework tie IT risk
For offshore oil gas industry operational risk management regulated regime many country
Hazard identification risk assessment tool technique described international standard ISO organisation IADC publish guideline HSE Case development based ISO standard
Further diagrammatic representation hazardous event often expected governmental regulator part risk management safety case submission known see
The technique also used organisation regulator mining aviation health defence industrial finance
The principle tool quality risk management increasingly applied different aspect pharmaceutical quality system
These aspect include development manufacturing distribution inspection process throughout lifecycle drug substance drug product biological biotechnological product including use raw material solvent excipients packaging labeling material drug product biological biotechnological product
Risk management also applied assessment relation pharmaceutical product cleanroom manufacturing environment
Risk communication complex academic field related targeted audience
Problems risk communicator involve reach intended audience make risk comprehensible relatable risk pay appropriate respect audience value related risk predict audience response communication etc
A main goal risk communication improve collective individual decision making
Risk communication somewhat related

In refers one two distinct related concept synchronization synchronization
refers idea multiple process join certain point order reach agreement commit certain sequence action
refers idea keeping multiple copy dataset coherence one another maintain
Process synchronization primitive commonly used implement data synchronization
The need synchronization arise merely system kind concurrent process even single processor system
Mentioned main need synchronization When job arrives fork point split N serviced n task
After serviced wait done processing
Then joined leave system
Thus parallel programming require synchronization parallel process wait several process occur
In relationship consumer process dependent producer process till necessary data produced
When multiple process dependent resource need access time operating system need ensure one processor access given point reduces concurrency
Thread synchronization defined mechanism ensures two concurrent simultaneously execute particular program segment known
Processes access critical section controlled using synchronization technique
When one thread start executing serialized segment program thread wait first thread finish
If proper synchronization technique applied may cause value variable may unpredictable vary depending timing process thread
For example suppose three process namely
All three concurrently executing need share common resource critical section shown Figure
Synchronization used avoid conflict accessing shared resource
Hence Process try access resource assigned one process time
If assigned Process process Process need wait Process free resource shown Figure
Another synchronization requirement need considered order particular process thread executed
For example board plane buy ticket
Similarly check without validating credential user name password
In way ATM provide service provide correct PIN
Other mutual exclusion synchronization also deal following One challenge exascale algorithm design minimize reduce synchronization
Synchronization take time computation especially distributed computing
Reducing synchronization drew attention computer scientist decade
Whereas becomes increasingly significant problem recently gap improvement computing latency increase
Experiments shown global communication due synchronization distributed computer take dominated share sparse iterative solver
This problem receiving increasing attention emergence new benchmark metric High Performance Conjugate Gradient HPCG ranking top supercomputer
The following classic problem synchronization These problem used test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme primitive
Many system provide hardware support code
A single processor could disable executing currently running code without inefficient system
The key ability require implement synchronization multiprocessor set hardware primitive ability atomically read modify memory location
Without capability cost building basic synchronization primitive high increase processor count increase
There number alternative formulation basic hardware primitive provide ability atomically read modify location together way tell read write performed atomically
These hardware primitive basic building block used build wide variety synchronization operation including thing
In general architect expect user employ basic hardware primitive instead expect primitive used system programmer build synchronization library process often complex tricky
Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instruction either memory word content two memory word
In prevent thread interference memory consistency error block code wrapped section
This force thread acquire said lock object execute block
The lock automatically released thread leaf block enter waiting state within block
Any variable update made thread synchronized block become visible thread whenever thread similarly acquires lock
In addition mutual exclusion memory consistency Java block enable signaling sending event thread acquired lock execute code block waiting lock within block
This mean Java synchronized section combine functionality mutexes event
Such primitive known
Any object fine used Java
The declaring object implicitly implied lock object whole method marked
The synchronization primitive
Synchronization designed cooperative demanding every thread process follow synchronization mechanism accessing protected resource critical section consistent result
In locking signaling lightweight synchronization type spinwait interlocked operation mechanism related synchronization
Another effective way implementing synchronization using spinlocks
Before accessing shared resource piece code every processor check flag
If flag reset processor set flag continues executing thread
But flag set locked thread would keep spinning loop keep checking flag set
But spinlocks effective flag reset lower cycle otherwise lead performance issue waste many processor cycle waiting
Barriers simple implement provide good responsiveness
They based concept implementing wait cycle provide synchronization
Consider three thread running simultaneously starting barrier
After time reach barrier still wait thread reach correct data
Once thread reach barrier start
After time thread reach wait thread correct data
Thus barrier synchronization multiple thread always thread end waiting thread example thread keep waiting thread
This result severe degradation process performance
The barrier synchronization wait function thread represented Wbarrier f Tbarrier Rthread Where Wbarrier wait time thread Tbarrier number thread arrived Rthread arrival rate thread
Experiments show total execution time spent waiting slower thread
Semaphores signalling mechanism allow one access section
A Semaphore flag certain fixed value associated time thread wish access section decrement flag
Similarly thread leaf section flag incremented
If flag zero thread access section get blocked chooses wait
Some semaphore would allow one thread process code section
Such Semaphores called binary semaphore similar Mutex
Here value semaphore thread allowed access value access denied
Synchronization originally concept whereby lock could obtained object
Its primary usage database
There two type file
lock may obtained many process thread
lock exclusive may used single time
Although lock derived file database data also shared memory process thread
Sometimes one object file locked time
If locked simultaneously overlap causing deadlock exception
exclusive lock thread based rely processor instruction
An abstract mathematical foundation synchronization primitive given
There also many theoretical device built top history monoid
Following synchronization example respect different platform
provides provides Enabling disabling kernel preemption replaced spinlocks uniprocessor system
Prior kernel version disabled interrupt implement short critical section
Since version later Linux fully preemptive
provides provides A distinctly different related concept
This refers need keep multiple copy set data coherent one another maintain Figure
For example database replication used keep multiple copy data synchronized database server store data different location
Examples include Some challenge user may face data synchronization When start something data usually simple format
It varies time organization grows evolves result building simple interface two application source target also need transform data passing target application
extraction transformation loading tool helpful stage managing data format complexity
This era system
Customers want see current status order current status parcel real time parcel current balance account etc
This show need system updated well enable smooth manufacturing process ordering material enterprise running stock synchronizing customer order manufacturing process etc
From real life exist many example processing give successful competitive advantage
There fixed rule policy enforce data security
It may vary depending system using
Even though security maintained correctly source system capture data security information access privilege must enforced target system well prevent potential misuse information
This serious issue particularly come handling secret confidential personal information
So sensitivity confidentiality data transfer information must encrypted
Data quality another serious constraint
For better management maintain good quality data common practice store data one location share different people different system application different location
It help preventing inconsistency data
There five different phase involved data synchronization process Each step critical
In case large amount data synchronization process need carefully planned executed avoid negative impact performance

I benn wondering following possibility I multiple hardware thread core someone decides use shared register allow fast synchronization among thread run CPU implement register instead main memory
Will work
work
Synchronization based requires shared data storage location involved thread read modify
Your shared register shared data storage location
The reason synchronizing register thread running different CPUs register would shared visible one thread
You think register memory location feature removed make faster
In fact something similar scenario possible SPARC processor
The SPARC large register file something like register register always visible register window rest register file
Usually window used implement fast stack frame several experimental runtime system used window support multiple thread

How someone synchronize two thread using serialization
According professor slide code assignment use serialization solve synchronization problem
He explain serialization
I tried research serialization mean put data specific order
I would understand mean thing case Running thread specific order
But I confused syntax question
My question Does serialization mean synchronization
How would one synchronize thread using serialization
Two thread executing require synchronization least one thread access modifies one variable write access accessed remaining thread either read write access
Therefore thread access set variable reading value read access synchronization needed
You probably know access variable multiple thread least one writes least one variable must happen critical region code
You synchronize access providing using instance Posix mutex lock
This permit concurrent execution multiple thread execution preserve correctness updating one variable involved
Of course concurrent execution multiple thread efficient way writing code general
However may also imagine different execution operation associated thread executed sequentially concurrently one order concurrent correct execution
This called
What mean strictly equivalent
Serialization must provide requirement exactly result provided concurrent correct execution
Note multiple possible concurrent correct execution outcome must one one
Now really want use serialization synchronize thread
The answer serialized execution general slower concurrent execution obvious since execution sequential concurrent
In practice serialization give correctness
You want thread execute concurrently performance reason however must ensure outcome correct independently actual concurrent execution took place
As example imagine two thread accessing variable amount money deposited bank
If thread want read amount money issue arises
However one thread want modify value problem arises need synchronize access
For instance one thread may depositing money account bank thread withdrawing money account wife ATM
In case access variable holding amount money must synchronized
Serialization case simple must either first withdraw money add money first add money bank account withdraw money
In case serialization provides correct outcome
To grant correct outcome case concurrent execution must instead protect variable using mutex lock access variable mutually exclusive thread
Otherwise value variable accessed thread without proper synchronization actually undefined bad money
You may example loose part money
Another type synchronization related mutual exclusion
Imagine instance one thread execute operation another thread completed
Another example thread execute specific condition true condition depends another thread includes previous example general requirement based evaluation predicate
For instance may synchronize thread way using Posix mutex lock condition variable
Serialization thoroughly studied context database transaction
A provides criterion correctness execution concurrent transaction database protocol ensure proper synchronization locking
But concept applies equally well thread well

Program execution called Process
When one process try access Data already held another process updating Data error several process try access data different error occurs
To overcome error mechanism called Process Synchronisation used
Still question

Sponsored Links Synchronization simple word mean though different still related concept
And synchronization process well synchronization data
Sponsored Links On one hand synchronization process mean multiple process join link come together said point agreement commitment sort reached per sequence action
The idea maintaining multiple copy dataset accordance hand maintain data dignity known data synchronization
Moreover process synchronization primitive also put use order implement data synchronization
Synchronization happens make useful multi processor system requirement synchronization follows A job come fork point divided N sub job serviced numerous task
And serviced sub job keep waiting sub job complete processing
Once process completed job come together leave system
In parallel programming also synchronization come handy
In tie consumer process depends producer process till time data ready
To reduce concurrency especially numerous process depend source access one time operating system work make sure processor accessing data given time
Thread synchronization mechanism concurrent thread process execute critical section time
If proper synchronization technique put action race condition witnessed mean variable value predicted
With synchronization one also easily deal issue deadlock priority inversion starvation busy waiting among thing
There problem face producer consumer problem bounded buffer problem reader writer problem dining philosopher problem
Furthermore problem used order test newly proposed synchronization primitive scheme
Most system provide hardware support critical section code
On hand mechanism related synchronization locking lightweight synchronization type signalling spin wait interlocked operation whereas Java help prevent thread interference well memory consistency issue block code generally wrapped synchronized section
Moreover type file lock synchronization namely read read write
If wish implement synchronization following way would helpful spinlock barrier semaphore

In refers one two different related concept synchronization synchronization data
commonly used implement

required one process must wait another complete operation proceeding
For example one process called writer may writing data certain main memory area another process reader may reading data

coordination event operate unison
The orchestra serf keep orchestra synchronized
Systems operating part synchrony said
Today synchronization occur global basis signal
synchronization clock critical problem ocean navigation accurate time required conjunction astronomical observation determine far East West vessel traveled
The invention accurate revolutionized marine navigation
By end century form signal gun flag dropping provided important port mariner could check chronometer error
Synchronization important operation century railway first major mean transport fast enough difference local time adjacent town noticeable
Each line handled problem synchronizing station headquarters standard
In territory sharing single railroad track controlled timetable
The need strict timekeeping led company settle one standard civil authority eventually abandoned local favor standard
In term digital logic data transfer requires
However use word clock sense different typical sense clock device keep track clock signal simply signal start end time period often minute measured microsecond nanosecond arbitrary relationship sidereal solar lunar time system measurement passage minute hour day
In different sense electronic system sometimes synchronized make event point far apart appear simultaneous certain perspective
Albert Einstein proved first relativity paper actually thing absolutely simultaneous event
Timekeeping technology satellite NTP provide access close approximation timescale used many terrestrial synchronization application kind
Synchronization important concept following field Synchronization multiple interacting occur system
For instance oscillator either symmetric coupling synchronize strength coupling frequency unit greater difference among natural oscillator frequency
Poincare phase oscillator model system interact partially synchronize within random regular network
In case global synchronization phase oscillator abrupt transition unsynchronized full synchronization take place coupling strength exceeds critical threshold
This known phase transition
Synchronization emergent property occurs broad range dynamical system including neural signaling beating heart synchronization light wave
Synchronization movement defined similar movement two people temporally aligned
This different mimicry movement occur short delay
idea moving time evokes particular emotion
This sparked first research movement synchronization effect human emotion
In group synchronization movement shown increase conformity cooperation trust however research group synchronization needed determine effect group whole individual within group
In group two people synchronization demonstrated increase affiliation compassion altruistic behaviour increase rapport
During argument synchrony arguing pair noted decrease however clear whether due change emotion factor
There evidence show movement synchronization requires people cause beneficial effect effect affiliation occur one dyad synchronizing movement something outside dyad
This known interpersonal synchrony
There dispute regarding true effect synchrony study
Research area detailing positive effect synchrony attributed synchrony alone however many experiment incorporate shared intention achieve synchrony
Indeed Reinforcement Cooperation Model suggests perception synchrony lead reinforcement cooperation occurring lead effect synchrony
More research required separate effect intentionality beneficial effect synchrony
Some system may approximately synchronized
Some application require relative offset event determined
For others event important

In process checking software system meet specification fulfills intended purpose
It may also referred
It normally responsibility part
In simple term software verification Assuming build X software achieve goal without bug gap
On hand software validation Was X built
Does X meet high level requirement
Verification validation thing although often confused
succinctly expressed difference Building right product implies creating Requirements Specification contains need goal stakeholder software product
If artifact incomplete wrong developer able build product stakeholder want
This form artifact specification validation
Building product right implies use Requirements Specification input next phase development process design process output Design Specification
Then also implies use Design Specification feed construction process
Every time output process correctly implement input specification software product one step closer final verification
If output process incorrect developer building product stakeholder want correctly
This kind verification called artifact specification verification
Software validation check software product satisfies fit intended use checking software meet user requirement specification artifact need operate software need stakeholder user operator administrator manager investor etc
There two way perform software validation internal external
During internal software validation assumed goal stakeholder correctly understood expressed requirement artifact precise comprehensively
If software meet requirement specification internally validated
External validation happens performed asking stakeholder software meet need
Different software development methodology call different level user stakeholder involvement feedback external validation discrete continuous event
Successful final external validation occurs stakeholder accept software product express satisfies need
Such final external validation requires use
However also possible perform internal static test find meet requirement specification fall scope static verification software running
Not software product whole validated
Requirements validated software product whole ready waterfall development process requires perfectly defined design start iterative development process require allow continual improvement
Examples artifact validation It would imply verify specification met running software possible anyone know
correctly implemented running software
Only reviewing associated artifact someone conclude specification met
The output software development process stage also subject verification checked input specification see definition CMMI
Examples artifact verification According Validation software development process seen form User Requirements Specification validation end development process equivalent Internal External Software validation
Verification CMMI point view evidently artifact kind
In word software verification ensures output phase software development process effectively carry corresponding input artifact specifies requirement design software product software validation ensures software product meet need stakeholder therefore requirement specification correctly accurately expressed first place
Software verification ensures built right confirms product provided fulfills plan developer
Software validation ensures built right thing confirms product provided fulfills intended use goal stakeholder
This article used strict definition verification
From testing perspective Both verification validation related concept
By verification validation guarantee software quality planning configuration management aspect software engineering required
Within M S community definition verification validation accreditation similar The definition M S validation focus accuracy M S represents intended use
Determining degree M S accuracy required M S approximation reality usually critical determine degree approximation acceptable intended use
This stand contrast software validation
In software system flawless performance absolutely necessary may used ensure correct operation system
However often software system formal method prove costly alternative method software V V must sought
In case often used
A test case tool used process
Test case may prepared software verification software validation determine product built according requirement user
Other method review may used early life cycle provide software validation
ISVV stand
ISVV targeted system aim increase quality software product thereby reducing risk cost operational life software
ISVV provides assurance software performs specified level confidence within designed parameter defined requirement
ISVV activity performed independent engineering team involved software development process ass process resulting product
The ISVV team independency performed three different level financial managerial technical
ISVV go far beyond traditional verification validation technique applied development team
While latter aim ensure software performs well nominal requirement ISVV focused requirement robustness reliability condition lead software fail
ISVV result finding fed back development team correction improvement
ISVV derives application IV V Independent Verification Validation software
Early ISVV application known today date back early sponsored first significant program related IV V Safeguard System
By end IV V rapidly becoming popular
The constant increase complexity size importance software lead increasing demand IV V applied software ISVV
Meanwhile IV V ISVV software system get consolidated widely used organisation DoD FAA NASA ESA
IV V mentioned formalised IEEE
Initially European consortium led composed DNV N Critical Software SA P Terma DK CODA Scisys UK created first version guide devoted ISVV called ESA Guide Independent Verification Validation support organization
SoftWcare SL E etc
In European Space Agency released second version SoftWcare SL supporting editor received input many different European Space ISVV stakeholder
This guide cover methodology applicable software engineering phase concern ISVV
ISVV usually composed five principal phase phase executed sequentially result tailoring process
Verification validation must meet compliance requirement law regulated industry often guided government agency industrial administrative authority
For instance requires software version validated

Applying system thinking computing climate sustainability Sometime I drafted frequently asked question list
Here I wrote meaning term validation verification The term Verification Validation commonly used software engineering mean two different type analysis
The usual definition In word validation concerned checking system meet customer actual need verification concerned whether system
Verification help determine whether software high quality ensure system useful
The distinction two term largely role specification
Validation process checking whether specification capture customer need verification process checking software meet specification
Verification includes activity associated producing high quality software testing inspection design analysis specification analysis
It relatively objective process various product document expressed precisely enough subjective judgement needed order verify software
In contrast validation extremely subjective process
It involves making subjective assessment well proposed system address need
Validation includes activity requirement modelling prototyping user evaluation
In traditional phased software lifecycle verification often taken mean checking product phase satisfy requirement previous phase
Validation relegated begining ending project requirement analysis acceptance testing
This view common many software engineering textbook misguided
It assumes customer requirement captured completely start project requirement change software developed
In practice requirement change throughout project partly reaction project development new software make new thing possible
Therefore validation verification needed throughout lifecycle
Finally V V regarded coherent discipline Software V V system engineering discipline evaluates software system context relative system element hardware user software
Software Verification Validation Its Role Computer Assurance Its Relationship Software Project Management Standards Dolores Wallace Roger Fujii NIST Special Publication Having thus carefully distinguished two term advice V V practitioner forget distinction think instead V V toolbox provides wide range tool asking different kind question software
And master use tool figure use
Here one attempt visualize space tool toolbox A range V V technique
Note modeling model checking refer building analyzing abstracted model software behaviour different kind beast scientific model used computational science For climate model definition focus specification make much sense detailed specification climate model built iterative refinement like agile software development
But matter toolbox approach still work mean tool applied little differently
An appropriate toolbox climate modeling look little different picture tool appropriate control system application software etc missing picture particular simulation software
I draw better picture I finished analyzing data field study practice used climate lab
Many different V V tool climate modelling lab room adding tool toolbox sharpening existing tool subject current research
But question best must proceed detailed analysis current practice effective
There seem plenty wandering space claiming model insufficiently verified validated
And people like pontificate climate modeler ought differently
But anyone pontificate way unable give detailed account V V technique climate modeller currently use blowing smoke
If know toolbox already really make constructive comment missing

Want watch later
Consider example
A county library staff currently record library transaction ledger everything lending material recording fine payment
They would like automate manual process use computerized system
A local software company volunteered design database use library PCs would streamline library service
Before company start write programming code database software developer gather detailed information current library process map specification automating component process
This early stage software development process known stage
An SRS document plan software
The plan analyzes detail function software would would interact existing system user interface would look like
For example head librarian request new software provide interface large font searching library catalog quick result easy read
This request added SRS document detailed plan designing implementing interface produced
The company go work programming code database using SRS document guide
Finally finished software product ready testing
At point software enters testing stage
occurs first version software developed
There many different level testing completed make sure software designed according specification performs expected logic error run
The two main category V V static testing dynamic testing
During programming code tested without software developer actually executing running software
Software tester use software tool test source code quality efficiency interaction among different module programming code
In example county library programmer write code software development team would perform static testing code application installed computer testing end user library staff
Get FREE access day create account
During software executed tested end user
A group people assigned test product
In example county library first version finished software might made available library staff testing
During stage error missing function identified
During dynamic testing librarian may find search feature find book due month even though request included SRS document
A library associate may find total amount fine due per patron accurately calculated software
All error identified V V stage recorded communicated software development team address issue make available next version product testing
This V V process continues error corrected feature described SRS document accurately implemented
Software verification testing critical component software development process
Without proper V V costly repercussion software development company end user
In software requirement specification SRS stage software developer gather requirement specification new software plan detail done
The purpose verification validation V V make sure requirement outlined SRS stage implemented coding run time error

The FDA analysis medical device recall conducted reveals attributable software failure
Of software related recall caused software defect introduced change made software initial production distribution
Software validation related good software engineering practice discussed guidance principal mean avoiding defect resultant recall
Software validation requirement Quality System regulation published Federal Register October took effect June
See Title Code Federal Regulations CFR Part Federal Register FR respectively
Validation requirement apply software used component medical device software medical device software used production device implementation device manufacturer quality system
Unless specifically exempted classification regulation medical device software product developed June regardless device class subject applicable design control provision
See CFR
This requirement includes completion current development project new development project change made existing medical device software
Specific requirement validation device software found CFR g
Other design control planning input verification review required medical device software
See CFR
The corresponding documented result activity provide additional support conclusion medical device software validated
Any software used automate part device production process part quality system must validated intended use required CFR
This requirement applies software used automate device design testing component acceptance manufacturing labeling packaging distribution complaint handling automate aspect quality system
In addition computer system used create modify maintain electronic record manage electronic signature also subject validation requirement
See CFR
Such computer system must validated ensure accuracy reliability consistent intended performance ability discern invalid altered record
Software application may developed contract
However software frequently purchased particular intended use
All production quality system software even purchased documented requirement fully define intended use information testing result evidence compared show software validated intended use
The use software automated medical device automated manufacturing quality system operation increasing
software may many capability needed device manufacturer
Device manufacturer responsible adequacy software used device used produce device
When device manufacturer purchase software must ensure perform intended chosen application
For software used manufacturing quality system additional guidance included document
For device software additional useful information may found FDA This document address Quality System regulation issue involve implementation software validation
It provides guidance management control software validation process
The management control software validation process confused validation requirement process validation automated manufacturing process
Device manufacturer may use procedure record compliance quality system design control requirement well submission FDA
This document cover specific safety efficacy issue related software validation
Design issue documentation requirement submission regulated software addressed document
Specific issue related safety efficacy documentation required submission addressed Office Device Evaluation ODE Center Devices Radiological Health CDRH Office Blood Research Review Center Biologics Evaluation Research CBER
See reference applicable FDA guidance document submission
Many people asked specific guidance FDA expects ensure compliance Quality System regulation regard software validation
Information software validation presented document new
Validation software using principle task listed Sections conducted many segment software industry well year
Due great variety medical device process manufacturing facility possible state one document specific validation element applicable
However general application several broad concept used successfully guidance software validation
These broad concept provide acceptable framework building comprehensive approach software validation
Additional specific information available many reference listed
Unless defined Quality System regulation otherwise specified term used guidance defined current edition FDA
The medical device Quality System regulation CFR k defines mean define document implement
Where appears guidance word establish established interpreted meaning
Some definition found medical device Quality System regulation confusing compared commonly used terminology software industry
Examples requirement specification verification validation
While Quality System regulation state design input requirement must documented specified requirement must verified regulation clarify distinction term requirement specification
A need expectation system software
Requirements reflect stated implied need customer may contractual statutory well organization internal requirement
There many different kind requirement design functional implementation interface performance physical requirement
Software requirement typically derived system requirement aspect system functionality allocated software
Software requirement typically stated functional term defined refined updated development project progress
Success accurately completely documenting software requirement crucial factor successful validation resulting software
A defined document state requirement
See CFR
It may refer include drawing pattern relevant document usually indicates mean criterion whereby conformity requirement checked
There many different kind written specification system requirement specification software requirement specification software design specification software test specification software integration specification etc
All document establish specified requirement design output various form verification necessary
The Quality System regulation harmonized treat verification validation separate distinct term
On hand many software engineering journal article textbook use term verification validation interchangeably case refer software verification validation testing VV T single concept distinction among three term
provides objective evidence design output particular phase software development life cycle meet specified requirement phase
Software verification look consistency completeness correctness software supporting documentation developed provides support subsequent conclusion software validated
Software testing one many verification activity intended confirm software development output meet input requirement
Other verification activity include various static dynamic analysis code document inspection walkthroughs technique
part design validation finished device separately defined Quality System regulation
For purpose guidance FDA considers software validation In practice software validation activity may occur well end software development life cycle ensure requirement fulfilled
Since software usually part larger hardware system validation software typically includes evidence software requirement implemented correctly completely traceable system requirement
A conclusion software validated highly dependent upon comprehensive software testing inspection analysis verification task performed stage software development life cycle
Testing device software functionality simulated use environment user site testing typically included component overall design validation program software automated device
Software verification validation difficult developer test forever hard know much evidence enough
In large measure software validation matter developing level confidence device meet requirement user expectation software automated function feature device
Measures defect found specification document estimate defect remaining testing coverage technique used develop acceptable level confidence shipping product
The level confidence therefore level software validation verification testing effort needed vary depending upon safety risk hazard posed automated function device
Additional guidance regarding safety risk management software may found Section FDA international standard referenced
For many year FDA regulated industry attempted understand define software validation within context process validation terminology
For example industry document FDA validation guidance sometimes describe user site software validation term installation qualification IQ operational qualification OQ performance qualification PQ
Definitions term additional information regarding may found FDA dated May FDA dated August
While terminology served purpose well one many legitimate way organize software validation task user site terminology may well understood among many software professional used elsewhere document
However FDA personnel device manufacturer need aware difference terminology ask provide information regarding software validation
The decision implement system functionality using software one typically made system design
Software requirement typically derived overall system requirement design aspect system implemented using software
There user need intended us finished device user typically specify whether requirement met hardware software combination
Therefore software validation must considered within context overall design validation system
A documented requirement specification represents user need intended us product developed
A primary goal software validation demonstrate completed software product comply documented software system requirement
The correctness completeness system requirement software requirement addressed part design validation process device
Software validation includes confirmation conformance software specification confirmation software requirement traceable system specification
Confirmation important part overall design validation ensure aspect medical device conform user need intended us
While software share many engineering task hardware important difference
For example Software validation critical tool used assure quality device software software automated operation
Software validation increase usability reliability device resulting decreased failure rate fewer recall corrective action le risk patient user reduced liability device manufacturer
Software validation also reduce long term cost making easier le costly reliably modify software revalidate software change
Software maintenance represent large percentage total cost software entire life cycle
An established comprehensive software validation process help reduce cost software reducing cost validation subsequent release software
Design review documented comprehensive systematic examination design evaluate adequacy design requirement evaluate capability design meet requirement identify problem
While may many informal technical review occur within development team software project formal design review structured includes participation others outside development team
Formal design review may reference include result formal informal review
Design review may conducted separately software software integrated hardware system
Design review include examination development plan requirement specification design specification testing plan procedure document activity associated project verification result stage defined life cycle validation result overall device
Design review primary tool managing evaluating development project
For example formal design review allow management confirm goal defined software validation plan achieved
The Quality System regulation requires least one formal design review conducted device design process
However recommended multiple design review conducted end software life cycle activity preparation proceeding next activity
Formal design review especially important near end requirement activity major resource committed specific design solution
Problems found point resolved easily save time money reduce likelihood missing critical issue
Answers key question documented formal design review
These include This section list general principle considered validation software
A documented software requirement specification provides baseline validation verification
The software validation process completed without established software requirement specification Ref CFR z aa f g
Software quality assurance need focus preventing introduction defect software development process trying test quality software code written
Software testing limited ability surface latent defect software code
For example complexity software prevents exhaustively tested
In order establish confidence software developer use mixture method technique prevent software error detect software error occur
The best mix method depends many factor including development environment application size project language risk
To build case software validated requires time effort
Preparation software validation begin early design development planning design input
The final conclusion software validated based evidence collected planned effort conducted throughout software lifecycle
Software validation take place within environment established software life cycle
The software life cycle contains software engineering task documentation necessary support software validation effort
In addition software life cycle contains specific verification validation task appropriate intended use software
This guidance recommend particular life cycle model selected used software development project
The software validation process defined controlled use plan
The software validation plan defines accomplished software validation effort
Software validation plan significant quality system tool
Software validation plan specify area scope approach resource schedule type extent activity task work item
The software validation process executed use procedure
These procedure establish conduct software validation effort
The procedure identify specific action sequence action must taken complete individual validation activity task work item
Due complexity software seemingly small local change may significant global system impact
When change even small change made software validation status software need
Based analysis software developer conduct appropriate level software regression testing show unchanged vulnerable portion system adversely affected
Design control appropriate regression testing provide confidence software validated software change
Validation coverage based software complexity safety risk firm size resource constraint
The selection validation activity task work item commensurate complexity software design risk associated use software specified intended use
For lower risk device baseline validation activity may conducted
As risk increase additional validation activity added cover additional risk
Validation documentation sufficient demonstrate software validation plan procedure completed successfully
Validation activity conducted using basic quality assurance precept independence review
extremely difficult
When possible independent evaluation always better especially higher risk application
Some firm contract independent verification validation solution may always feasible
Another approach assign internal staff member involved particular design implementation sufficient knowledge evaluate project conduct verification validation activity
Smaller firm may need creative task organized assigned order maintain internal independence review
Specific implementation software validation principle may quite different one application another
The device manufacturer flexibility choosing apply validation principle retains ultimate responsibility demonstrating software validated
Software designed developed validated regulated wide spectrum environment wide variety device varying level risk
FDA regulated medical device application include software In environment software component many source may used create application developed software software contract software shareware
In addition software component come many different form application software operating system compiler debugger configuration management tool many
The validation software environment complex undertaking therefore appropriate software validation principle considered designing software validation process
The resultant software validation process commensurate safety risk associated system device process
Software validation activity task may dispersed occurring different location conducted different organization
However regardless distribution task contractual relation source component development environment device manufacturer specification developer retains ultimate responsibility ensuring software validated
Software validation accomplished series activity task planned executed various stage software development life cycle
These task may one time occurrence may iterated many time depending life cycle model used scope change made software project progress
This guidance recommend use specific software life cycle model
Software developer establish software life cycle model appropriate product organization
The software life cycle model selected cover software birth retirement
Activities typical software life cycle model include following Verification testing task support software validation occur activity
A life cycle model organizes software development activity various way provides framework monitoring controlling software development project
Several software life cycle model waterfall spiral rapid prototyping incremental development etc
defined FDA dated August
These many life cycle model described various reference listed
For software life cycle activity certain typical task support conclusion software validated
However specific task performed order performance iteration timing performance dictated specific software life cycle model selected safety risk associated software application
For low risk application certain task may needed
However software developer least consider task define document task appropriate specific application
The following discussion generic intended prescribe particular software life cycle model particular order task performed
Design development planning culminate plan identifies necessary task procedure anomaly reporting resolution necessary resource management review requirement including formal design review
A software life cycle model associated activity identified well task necessary software life cycle activity
The plan include Management must identify provide appropriate software development environment resource
See CFR b
Typically task requires personnel well physical resource
The plan identify personnel facility equipment resource task role risk hazard management play
A configuration management plan developed guide control multiple parallel development activity ensure proper communication documentation
Controls necessary ensure positive correct correspondence among approved version specification document source code object code test suite comprise software system
The control also ensure accurate identification access currently approved version
Procedures created reporting resolving software anomaly found validation activity
Management identify report specify content format responsible organizational element report
Procedures also necessary review approval software development result including responsible organizational element review approval
Requirements development includes identification analysis documentation information device intended use
Areas special importance include allocation system function operating condition user characteristic potential hazard anticipated task
In addition requirement state clearly intended use software
The software requirement specification document contain written definition software function
It possible validate software without predetermined documented software requirement
Typical software requirement specify following Software safety requirement derived technical risk management process closely integrated system requirement development process
Software requirement specification identify clearly potential hazard result software failure system well safety requirement implemented software
The consequence software failure evaluated along mean mitigating failure hardware mitigation defensive programming etc
From analysis possible identify appropriate measure necessary prevent harm
The Quality System regulation requires mechanism addressing incomplete ambiguous conflicting requirement
See CFR c
Each requirement hardware software user operator interface safety identified software requirement specification evaluated accuracy completeness consistency testability correctness clarity
For example software requirement evaluated verify A software requirement traceability analysis conducted trace software requirement system requirement risk analysis result
In addition analysis documentation used verify software requirement formal design review recommended confirm requirement fully specified appropriate extensive software design effort begin
Requirements approved released incrementally care taken interaction interface among software hardware requirement properly reviewed analyzed controlled
In design process software requirement specification translated logical physical representation software implemented
The software design specification description software
Due complexity project enable person varying level technical responsibility clearly understand design information design specification may contain high level summary design detailed design information
The completed software design specification constrains stay within intent agreed upon requirement design
A complete software design specification relieve programmer need make ad hoc design decision
The software design need address human factor
Use error caused design either overly complex contrary user intuitive expectation operation one persistent critical problem encountered FDA
Frequently design software factor use error
Human factor engineering woven entire design development process including device design requirement analysis test
Device safety usability issue considered developing flowchart state diagram prototyping tool test plan
Also task function analysis risk analysis prototype test review full usability test performed
Participants user population included applying methodology
The software design specification include The first four element noted usually separate document included reference software design specification
Software requirement specification discussed preceding section software risk analysis
Written development procedure serve guide organization written programming procedure serve guide individual programmer
As software validated without knowledge context intended function system documentation referenced
If element included software may helpful future reviewer maintainer software clearly stated There error message program
The activity occur software design several purpose
Software design evaluation conducted determine design complete correct consistent unambiguous feasible maintainable
Appropriate consideration software architecture modular structure design reduce magnitude future validation effort software change needed
Software design evaluation may include analysis control flow data flow complexity timing sizing memory allocation criticality analysis many aspect design
A traceability analysis conducted verify software design implement software requirement
As technique identifying requirement sufficient traceability analysis also verify aspect design traceable software requirement
An analysis communication link conducted evaluate proposed design respect hardware user related software requirement
The software risk analysis determine whether additional hazard identified whether new hazard introduced design
At end software design activity Formal Design Review conducted verify design correct consistent complete accurate testable moving implement design
Portions design approved released incrementally implementation care taken interaction communication link among various element properly reviewed analyzed controlled
Most software development model iterative
This likely result several version software requirement specification software design specification
All approved version archived controlled accordance established configuration management procedure
Software may constructed either coding programming assembling together previously coded software component code library software etc
use new application
Coding software activity detailed design specification implemented source code
Coding lowest level abstraction software development process
It last stage decomposition software requirement module specification translated programming language
Coding usually involves use programming language may also entail use assembly language microcode operation
The source code may either compiled interpreted use target hardware platform
Decisions selection programming language software build tool assembler linkers compiler include consideration impact subsequent quality evaluation task availability debugging testing tool chosen language
Some compiler offer optional level command error checking assist debugging code
Different level error checking may used throughout coding process warning message compiler may may recorded
However end coding debugging process rigorous level error checking normally used document compilation error still remain software
If rigorous level error checking used final translation source code justification use le rigorous translation error checking documented
Also final compilation documentation compilation process outcome including warning message compiler resolution justification decision leave issue unresolved
Firms frequently adopt specific coding guideline establish quality policy procedure related software coding process
Source code evaluated verify compliance specified coding guideline
Such guideline include coding convention regarding clarity style complexity management commenting
Code comment provide useful descriptive information module including expected input output variable referenced expected data type operation performed
Source code also evaluated verify compliance corresponding detailed design specification
Modules ready integration test documentation compliance coding guideline applicable quality policy procedure
Source code evaluation often implemented code inspection code walkthroughs
Such static analysis provide effective mean detect error execution code
They allow examination error isolation also help focusing later dynamic testing software
Firms may use manual desk checking appropriate control ensure consistency independence
Source code evaluation extended verification internal linkage module layer horizontal vertical interface compliance design specification
Documentation procedure used result source code evaluation maintained part design verification
A source code traceability analysis important tool verify code linked established specification established test procedure
A source code traceability analysis conducted documented verify Software testing entail running software product known condition defined input documented outcome compared predefined expectation
It time consuming difficult imperfect activity
As requires early planning order effective efficient
Test plan test case created early software development process feasible
They identify schedule environment resource personnel tool etc
methodology case input procedure output expected result documentation reporting criterion
The magnitude effort applied throughout testing process linked complexity criticality reliability safety issue requiring function module produce critical outcome challenged intensive testing fault tolerance feature
Descriptions category software software testing effort appear literature example Software test plan identify particular task conducted stage development include justification level effort represented corresponding completion criterion
Software testing limitation must recognized considered planning testing particular software product
Except simplest program software exhaustively tested
Generally feasible test software product possible input possible test possible data processing path occur program execution
There one type testing testing methodology ensure particular software product thoroughly tested
Testing program functionality mean program tested
Testing program code mean necessary functionality present program
Testing program functionality program code mean program correct
Software testing find error interpreted mean error exist software product may mean testing superficial
An essential element software test case expected result
It key detail permit objective evaluation actual test result
This necessary testing information obtained corresponding predefined definition specification
A software specification document must identify achieved engineering measurable objectively verifiable level detail order confirmed testing
The real effort effective software testing lie definition tested rather performance test
A software testing process based principle foster effective examination software product
Applicable software testing tenet include Once prerequisite task code inspection successfully completed software testing begin
It start unit level testing concludes system level testing
There may distinct integration level testing
A software product challenged test case based internal structure test case based external specification
These test provide thorough rigorous examination software product compliance functional performance interface definition requirement
testing also known structural testing testing
It identifies test case based knowledge obtained source code detailed design specification development document
These test case challenge control decision made program program data structure including configuration table
Structural testing identify dead code never executed program run
Structural testing accomplished primarily unit module level testing extended level software testing
The level structural testing evaluated using metric designed show percentage software structure evaluated structural testing
These metric typically referred coverage measure completeness respect test selection criterion
The amount structural coverage commensurate level risk posed software
Use term coverage usually mean coverage
For example testing program achieved statement coverage mean statement software executed least
Common structural coverage metric include testing also known functional testing testing
It identifies test case based definition software product whether unit module complete program intended
These test case challenge intended use functionality program program internal external interface
Functional testing applied level software testing unit system level testing
The following type functional software testing involve generally increasing level effort Functional structural software test case identification technique provide specific input testing rather random test input
One weakness technique difficulty linking structural functional test completion criterion software product reliability
Advanced software testing method statistical testing employed provide assurance software product dependable
Statistical testing us randomly generated test data defined distribution based operational profile expected use hazardous use malicious use software product
Large amount test data generated targeted cover particular area concern providing increased possibility identifying individual multiple rare operating condition anticipated either software product designer tester
Statistical testing also provides high structural coverage
It require stable software product
Thus structural functional testing prerequisite statistical testing software product
Another aspect software testing testing software change
Changes occur frequently software development
These change result debugging find error corrected new changed requirement requirement creep modified design effective efficient implementation found
Once software product baselined approved change product mini life cycle including testing
Testing changed software product requires additional effort
Not demonstrate change implemented correctly testing also demonstrate change adversely impact part software product
Regression analysis testing employed provide assurance change created problem elsewhere software product
Regression analysis determination impact change based review relevant documentation software requirement specification software design specification source code test plan test case test script etc
order identify necessary regression test run
Regression testing rerunning test case program previously executed correctly comparing current result previous result order detect unintended effect software change
Regression analysis regression testing also employed using integration method build software product ensure newly integrated module adversely impact operation previously integrated module
In order provide thorough rigorous examination software product development testing typically organized level
As example software product testing organized unit integration system level testing
Control measure traceability analysis used ensure intended coverage achieved
System level testing also exhibit software product behavior intended operating environment
The location testing dependent upon software developer ability produce target operating environment
Depending upon circumstance simulation testing potential customer location may utilized
Test plan identify control needed ensure intended coverage achieved proper documentation prepared planned system level testing conducted site directly controlled software developer

Terminology regarding user site testing confusing
Terms beta test site validation user acceptance test installation verification installation testing used describe user site testing
For purpose guidance term user site testing encompasses testing take place outside developer controlled environment
This testing take place user site actual hardware software part installed system configuration
The testing accomplished either actual simulated use software tested within context intended function
Guidance contained general nature applicable user site testing
However area blood establishment system may specific site validation issue need considered planning user site testing
Test planner check FDA Center corresponding product jurisdiction determine whether additional regulatory requirement user site testing
User site testing follow written plan formal summary testing record formal acceptance
Documented evidence testing procedure test input data test result retained
There evidence hardware software installed configured specified
Measures ensure system component exercised testing version component specified
The testing plan specify testing throughout full range operating condition specify continuation sufficient time allow system encounter wide spectrum condition event effort detect latent fault apparent normal activity
Some evaluation performed earlier software developer developer site repeated site actual use
These may include test high volume data heavy load stress security fault testing avoidance detection tolerance recovery error message implementation safety requirement
The developer may able furnish user test data set used purpose
In addition evaluation system ability properly perform intended function evaluation ability user system understand correctly interface
Operators able perform intended function respond appropriate timely manner alarm warning error message
During user site testing record maintained proper system performance system failure encountered
The revision system compensate fault detected user site testing follow procedure control software change
The developer software may may involved user site testing
If developer involved may seamlessly carry user site last portion system testing
If developer involved important user person understand importance careful test planning definition expected test result recording test output
As applied software term maintenance mean applied hardware
The operational maintenance hardware software different mechanism different
Hardware maintenance typically includes preventive hardware maintenance action component replacement corrective change
Software maintenance includes corrective perfective adaptive maintenance include preventive maintenance action software component replacement
Changes made correct error fault software corrective maintenance
Changes made software improve performance maintainability attribute software system perfective maintenance
Software change make software system usable changed environment adaptive maintenance
When change made software system either initial development post release maintenance sufficient regression analysis testing conducted demonstrate portion software involved change adversely impacted
This addition testing evaluates correctness implemented change
The specific validation effort necessary software change determined type change development product affected impact product operation software
Careful complete documentation design structure interrelationship various module interface limit validation effort needed change made
The level effort needed fully validate change also dependent upon degree validation original software documented archived
For example test documentation test case result previous verification validation testing need archived available performing subsequent regression testing
Failure archive information later use significantly increase level effort expense revalidating software change made
In addition software verification validation task part standard software development process following additional maintenance task addressed The Quality System regulation requires computer automated data processing system used part production quality system device manufacturer shall validate computer software intended use according established protocol
See CFR
This regulatory requirement FDA medical device Good Manufacturing Practice GMP regulation since
In addition validation requirement computer system implement part device manufacturer production process quality system used create maintain record required FDA regulation subject Electronic Records Electronic Signatures regulation
See CFR Part
This regulation establishes additional security data integrity validation requirement record created maintained electronically
These additional Part requirement carefully considered included system requirement software requirement automated record system
System validation software validation demonstrate Part requirement met
Computers automated equipment used extensively throughout aspect medical device design laboratory testing analysis product inspection acceptance production process control environmental control packaging labeling traceability document control complaint management many aspect quality system
Increasingly automated plant floor operation involve extensive use embedded system Software tool frequently used design build test software go automated medical device
Many commercial software application word processor spreadsheet database flowcharting software used implement quality system
All application subject requirement software validation validation approach used application vary widely
Whether production quality system software developed device manufacturer developed contractor purchased developed using basic principle outlined elsewhere guidance
The device manufacturer latitude flexibility defining validation software accomplished validation key consideration deciding software developed purchased
The software developer defines life cycle model
Validation typically supported The level validation effort commensurate risk posed automated operation
In addition risk factor complexity process software degree device manufacturer dependent upon automated process produce safe effective device determine nature extent testing needed part validation effort
Documented requirement risk analysis automated process help define scope evidence needed show software validated intended use
For example automated milling machine may require little testing device manufacturer show output operation subsequently fully verified specification release
On hand extensive testing may needed Numerous commercial software application may used part quality system spreadsheet statistical package used quality system calculation graphic package used trend analysis commercial database used recording device history record complaint management
The extent validation evidence needed software depends device manufacturer documented intended use software
For example device manufacturer chooses use capability software need validate function used device manufacturer dependent upon software result part production quality system
However high risk application running operating environment software function even software function used
Risk mitigation technique memory partitioning approach resource protection may need considered high risk application lower risk application used operating environment
When software upgraded change made software device manufacturer consider change may impact used portion software must reconfirm validation portion software used
See CFR
A important key software validation documented user requirement specification defines The device manufacturer user need define expected operating environment including required hardware software configuration software version utility etc
The user also need The validation must conducted accordance documented protocol validation result must also documented
See CFR
Test case documented exercise system challenge performance criterion especially critical parameter
Test case address error alarm condition startup shutdown applicable user function operator control potential operator error maximum minimum range allowed value stress condition applicable intended use equipment
The test case executed result recorded evaluated determine whether result support conclusion software validated intended use
A device manufacturer may conduct validation using personnel may depend third party vendor consultant
In case device manufacturer retains ultimate responsibility ensuring production quality system software The device manufacturer documentation including objectively confirms software validated intended use
Most automated equipment system used device manufacturer supplied vendor purchased OTS
The device manufacturer responsible ensuring product development methodology used OTS software developer appropriate sufficient device manufacturer intended use OTS software
For OTS software equipment device manufacturer may may access vendor software validation documentation
If vendor provide information system requirement software requirement validation process result validation medical device manufacturer use information beginning point required validation documentation
The vendor life cycle documentation testing protocol result source code design specification requirement specification useful establishing software validated
However documentation frequently available commercial equipment vendor vendor may refuse share proprietary information
Where possible depending upon device risk involved device manufacturer consider auditing vendor design development methodology used construction OTS software ass development validation documentation generated OTS software
Such audit conducted device manufacturer qualified third party
The audit demonstrate vendor procedure result verification validation activity performed OTS software appropriate sufficient safety effectiveness requirement medical device produced using software
Some vendor accustomed operating regulated environment may documented life cycle process support device manufacturer validation requirement
Other vendor may permit audit
Where necessary validation information available vendor device manufacturer need perform sufficient system level black box testing establish software meet user need intended us
For many application black box testing alone sufficient
Depending upon risk device produced role OTS software process ability audit vendor sufficiency information use OTS software equipment may may appropriate especially suitable alternative available
The device manufacturer also consider implication continued maintenance support OTS software vendor terminate support
For software development tool software compiler linkers editor operating system exhaustive testing device manufacturer may impractical
Without testing key element validation effort may possible validate software tool
However proper operation may satisfactorily inferred mean
For example compiler frequently certified independent testing commercial software product may bug list system requirement operational information available vendor compared device manufacturer intended use help focus testing effort
operating system need validated separate program
However validation testing application software address operating system service used including maximum loading condition file operation handling system error condition memory constraint may applicable intended use application program

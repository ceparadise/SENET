In ondeterministic olynomial time used describe certain type
Informally NP set decision problem instance answer yes efficiently
More precisely proof verifiable computation performed
Equivalently formal definition NP set decision problem polynomial time theoretical
This second definition basis abbreviation NP stand polynomial time
However tends intuitive practical common application compared formal
The two definition equivalent algorithm machine definition consists two phase first consists guess solution generated way second phase consists deterministic algorithm verifies reject guess valid solution problem
A method solving decision problem given form
In definition NP refers increasing number machine operation needed algorithm relative size problem
Polynomial time therefore measure efficiency algorithm
Decision problem commonly categorized complexity class NP based fastest known machine algorithm
As decision problem may change class faster algorithm discovered
The complexity class contained NP NP contains many important problem hardest called problem whose solution sufficient deal NP problem polynomial time
The important open question complexity theory asks whether polynomial time algorithm actually exist solving corollary NP problem
It widely believed case
The complexity class NP efficiently verifiable proof answer yes also related complexity class efficiently verifiable proof answer
Whether NP another outstanding question complexity theory
The complexity class NP defined term follows set decision problem solved time
Alternatively NP defined using deterministic Turing machine verifier
A NP exist polynomial deterministic Turing machine Many natural problem covered class NP
In particular decision version many interesting optimization problem contained NP
In order explain definition NP let u consider Assume given wish know whether integer sum zero
In example answer yes since subset integer corresponds sum The task deciding whether subset sum zero exists called
To answer integer add zero create algorithm obtains possible subset
As number integer feed algorithm becomes larger number subset grows exponentially computation time
However notice given particular subset often called easily check whether subset sum zero summing integer subset
So sum indeed zero particular subset fact answer yes
An algorithm verifies whether given subset sum zero called
More generally problem said NP exists verifier V problem
Given instance I problem P answer yes must exist certificate also called witness W given ordered pair I W input V return answer yes polynomial time
Furthermore answer I verifier return input I W possible Note V could return answer No even answer I yes W valid witness
For example subset sum problem subset whose sum zero select W subset whose sum zero verifier return No subset whose sum zero verifier return regardless choice The verifier need polynomial time need check whether W really subset I whether sum W zero subset sum problem NP
The version problem stated given finite set integer every subset nonzero sum
The definition NP require certificate
The class problem certificate called
In fact open question whether problem NP also certificate thus
Equivalent definition following characterization NP set solvable run
This mean accepting computation path word language defined dually rejecting path
This definition equivalent definition Turing machine could solve NP problem polynomial time selecting certificate running verifier certificate
Similarly machine exists polynomial time verifier naturally constructed
This incomplete list problem NP
NP closed It known whether NP closed question NP versus question Because many important problem class extensive effort find algorithm problem NP
However remain large number problem NP defy attempt seeming require
Whether problem decidable polynomial time one greatest open question see discussion
An important notion context set decision problem subset NP might informally described hardest problem NP
If algorithm even algorithm problem NP
Because dedicated research failed find polynomial algorithm problem problem proven widely regarded sign polynomial algorithm problem unlikely exist
However practical us instead spending computational resource looking optimal solution good enough potentially suboptimal solution may often found polynomial time
Also real life application problem easier theoretical equivalent
The two definition NP class problem solvable nondeterministic TM polynomial time class problem verifiable deterministic Turing machine polynomial time equivalent
The proof described many textbook example Sipser section
To show first suppose deterministic verifier
A nondeterministic machine simply nondeterministically run verifier possible proof string requires polynomially many step nondeterministically choose next character proof string step length proof string must polynomially bounded
If proof valid path accept proof valid string language reject
Conversely suppose nondeterministic TM called A accepting given language At polynomially many step machine branch finite number direction
There must least one accepting path string describing path proof supplied verifier
The verifier deterministically simulate A following accepting path verifying accepts end
If A reject input accepting path verifier always reject
NP contains problem since one verify instance problem simply ignoring proof solving
NP contained show suffices construct PSPACE machine loop proof string feed one verifier
Since machine read polynomially many bit use polynomial space read proof string occupying polynomial space consider proof longer
NP also contained since algorithm operates exponential time
contains problem simple proof instance sometimes called counterexample
For example trivially lie since one refute primality integer merely supplying nontrivial factor
NP together form first level higher NP defined using deterministic machine
If permit verifier probabilistic however necessarily BPP machine get class solvable using communication Arthur Merlin
NP class analogous class function problem
The known strict inclusion came respectively NP NP
In term NP corresponds precisely set language definable existential
NP seen simple type prover come proof certificate verifier deterministic machine check
It complete right proof string make accept one sound verifier accept acceptable proof string
A major result complexity theory NP characterized problem solvable verifier us O log random bit examines constant number bit proof string class log
More informally mean NP verifier described replaced one place proof string using limited number coin flip determine correct answer high probability
This allows several result hardness proven
The decision version NP
Given input matrix distance city problem determine route visiting city total distance le
A proof certificate simply list city
Then verification clearly done polynomial time deterministic
It simply add matrix entry corresponding path city
A find route follows One think guess new copy Turing machine follow possible path forward least one machine find route distance le machine accepts input
Equivalently thought single Turing machine always guess correctly A range possible distance convert decision version Traveling Salesman optimization version calling decision version repeatedly polynomial number time

What problem
Why important topic computer science
stand time
This mean problem solved Polynomial time using Turing machine like regular Turing machine also including choice function
Basically solution poly time
If case known NP problem solved using given problem modified input NP problem given problem problem NP complete
The main thing take away problem solved polynomial time known way
way showing certain class problem solvable realistic time
Edit As others noted often approximation solution problem
In case approximation solution usually give approximation bound using special notation tell u close approximation
NP set question answer polynomial time O n problem size constant
Polynomial time sometimes used definition
P set decision problem
Since solved polynomial time also verified polynomial time
Therefore P subset NP
A problem x NP also every problem NP quickly ie
polynomial time transformed x
In word So make interesting one problem solved quickly problem solved quickly
See also post problem least hard hardest problem NP
Note problem also
However problem NP even decision problem despite prefix
That NP mean
Yes confusing usage entrenched unlikely change
mean something specific careful get definition wrong
First NP problem problem A problem X If X deterministic algorithm exists solve instance X correctly problem NP solved reduction X
So far nobody come deterministic algorithm nobody proven one exist million buck anyone either
That mean ca solve particular instance problem
It mean ca something work reliably instance problem way could reliably sort list integer
You might well able come algorithm work well practical instance problem
If looking example problem I suggest take look
The basic premise expression way saying series expression joined ORs must true The problem find solution satisfy expression exactly booleans match A solution one might
However algorithm discovered solve problem general case polynomial time
What mean best way solve problem essentially brute force try different combination find one work
What special problem ANY problem reduced problem
This mean find algorithm solve problem get mention respect admiration computer scientist mathematician around world

Timothy Casey Hons
Consulting Geologist This article explores nature scientific investigation view dispel popular misconception science
Here consider scientific process requirement credible scientific publication
Science collaboration scepticism evidence
Evidence must verifiable order scientific scientific theory thus constrained explanation verifiable evidence
Science nature subject scrutiny refutation anyone call science question
Science found colourful page glossy magazine report scientific publication much way tabloid report celebrity
Generally scientific literature black white poorly written difficult read
The thing stand scientific literature rarity statement go unreferenced complete absence mystery anonymous source
Ultimately science empirical rather theoretical
As Fourier point present state physical science known fact naturally explained without recourse property derived actual observation
It worth noting unlike idea revolutionary brilliant scientist Fourier withstood passage time directly underpinned verifiable fact rather deduced accepted theory
According Eleventh Edition Concise Oxford Dictionary Science noun intellectual practical activity encompassing systematic study structure behaviour physical natural world observation experiment
Empirical adjective based concerned verifiable observation experience rather theory pure logic
As see science conducted past tense appropriately referred observation experience
In fact term used French particularly century refer experimental outcome
Science thus defined strict empiricism
Science monopoly academia intelligentsia
We conduct scientific experiment every day
We look way crossing road make sure clear even traffic light traffic officer tell u safe
When pouring drink check level repeatedly want test temperature water stepping shower without asking opinion
These repeatable therefore scientific test tell u something reality need ask consensus accepting result test
In fact reliable way developing expertise verifying everything presented actually accepting
Whether expertise obtain result lauded qualification entirely unknown others largely irrelevant reliability knowledge reality expertise
This question competence independent recognition
A eminently verifiable example undocumented expertise knowledge HTML CSS
I formal qualification area apart passing mention uninteresting resume expertise field entirely undocumented unknown
Yet whether hate colour graphic web site handful people world capable reproducing scratch combination feature full standard compliance interoperability way back unscripted menu fixed scrolling layout appropriate printability offered page design I developed product unfunded unsanctioned research
Many people blame science ill world whether big brother watching every move gun used mugging technology central major environmental damage often science blamed idiot fun profit use technology barely understand
I wonder many people using computer read article understand principle defending narrowest gap terrain applies online security
Yet time technology blamed ease hacker worm penetrate personal computer system vast majority commercial web designer refuse invest modern methodology devoid active scripting thereby putting pressure public surf internet unsecured criminal use active scripting web development bottom line considered developer important security
The fact entire decade spanning I successfully kept hacker worm RISC based system could described Thou prof done matter reading instruction manual yes external API closed unknown site program like browser actually comply registry restriction API access really secure browser ignore security restriction specified registry
etc
This also indisputable example fact expertise need known even recognised effective
After know I expertise still change well unknown expertise mine served year
However case expertise derives reading manual examining advanced setting basic stuff people bother application perform superficially simple task browsing internet
Who blame someone else problem occur lazy read manual explore capability limitation software could compromise computer security misused
What right anyone blame scientist even science misuse applicable technology
In another example technological acceleration industry blamed subsequent environmental problem commercial executive industry scientist make decision sacrifice environment extra dollar
Executives inanimate force nature liable human being capable responsible moderation industrialisation competition
In matter research making technological abuse possible I would assert u use technology responsibly deprived account criminally negligent
Commerce ultimately exploit corrupts science financial gain executive
In excess US invested research mean prove anthropogenic global warming Carter represents commercial vested interest Climate Change Catastrophism
Is wonder scientist game openly contradict commercial bias vested anthropogenic global warming agenda
Royer et al
calculate temperature carbon dioxide curve consistent major glaciation across Phanerozoic otherwise cogent article
However failure maintain sufficient level scepticism avoid employing article title could substantiate false cause Shaviv Veizer raise question influence financial benefactor integrity scientific process
Science commerce science journalism
Science simply process using repeatable method acquire understand verifiable fact test hypothesis
Neither commercial agenda political deception form journalistic sensationalism place scientific process
Science neither authoritarian democratic exists exclusive purpose developing transparent understanding reality practical application nothing infallibility harmony unity consensus warm fuzzy social phenomenon
Science subject topic much discipline evaluating definitive information
The difference science humanity humanity abundance indeterminate information ancient literature unsupported historical account etc
often lack definitive information whereas science abundance definitive information little enough ambiguity forgo complex interpretation
As consequence interpretive error science glaringly evident occur Eg
argument irrelevance Oreskes false cause Royer et
An understanding difference fact interpretation nonetheless vital branch study
Whereas theologian faced knowledge despite certain statement appearing certain context either context statement may ambiguous making conclusion drawn purely subjective
Even skilled translator face problem indeterminate feature information
Does Luke New Testament Bible state Kingdom God within Kingdom God among
Nobody know evidence support definitive context interpretation translation bible supplanted personal interpretation usually subject religious prejudice translator seen absence footnote inform reader ambiguity
Science blessed perhaps cursed rarity indeterminate information
Where data prove ambiguous successful resolution come gathering data directly related context problem set
Long experience taught scientist accept conclusion based ambiguous data
For example show picture small area asymmetric ripple bedding surface sandstone propose current direction I reject proposal without knowing asymmetric ripple bifurcated three possible current direction trilemma resolved observation greater bedding surface area
Where indeterminacy result recognised scientific investigation longer scientific investigation doomed lose minefield probability chaos
verbal scalar eg
binary algebra quaternary logic etc play enormous role connecting evidence conclusion
nonetheless assumed requirement scientific process I cover
The scientific process based independent verification four part hypothesis method result theory
These part embody falsifiability repeatability verifiability testability structure build hypothesis evidence acquires evidence either falsify hypothesis confirm theory
A hypothesis falsifiable statement conjecturing expected outcome investigation based state knowledge prior investigation
The important aspect hypothesis admission human tendency form opinion fact gathered
By documenting opinion outset investigator recorded prejudice might effect conduct investigation
This demand investigator knowledge question convenient result thoroughly
It vital hypothesis falsifiable
A hypothesis definition true case scientific
For example state copper turn gold year mine
This scientific hypothesis speaking messenger God meaning interpretation word shift make statement correct
He may example talking soul base metal would speaking scientist
Prophets people society claim right infallibility variable interpretation
It would appear political perhaps commercial exponent anthropogenic global warming also lay claim special right afforded allegedly direct communication God
For example shift definition anthropogenic global warming include global cooling predict ice age possibly result apparent temperature trend decline year since degrades hypothesis anthropogenic global warming cheap prophesy impossible falsify
Even medium become aware work astrophysicist documented Archibald demonstrating insignificance human impact global mean temperature meaning term would shift evade refutation
For hypothesis scientific must unambiguous fixed definition sufficient allow potential falsification experiment research
Anthropogenic global warming redefined often scientifically acceptable hypothesis
A scientific method definition repeatable
If experimental result verified repetition scientific
For example geologist point global warming unprecedented geological record adequately equipped individual remeasure oxygen isotope ratio paleaotemperature record calculated
The method isotope measurement repeatable conducted genuine university world
IQ testing hand employ method Cattell Wechsler Kaufman therefore largely unscientific
Resit test I mentioned experience give advantage change result
Increasing complexity test Porteus Maze Test Porteus growing hierarchy test employed Casey repeated identical condition return result make methodology truly scientific
Due repeatability increasing complexity test much useful employed measure IQ regard verifying factor influence IQ circulation cholesterol inebriation fatigue sleep deprivation waking state hunger discomfort distraction stress expectancy etc
Scientific investigation hypothesis four possible outcome
The hypothesis NEW evidence gathered insufficient confirm deny hypothesis
This usually happens experiment fails field devoid statistically valid amount data example geological field study area outcrop
The hypothesis VAGUE gathered statistically valid amount data statistically significant uncertainty whether data confirms denies hypothesis
The hypothesis TRUE data confirms hypothesis without statistically significant uncertainty hypothesis FALSE data denies hypothesis without statistically significant uncertainty
Any fact verified scientific
It scientific fact water boil degree Celsius around kilopascals pressure
You test placing thermometer pot water observing temperature water heated boiling point
The boiling point water verifiable therefore scientific fact
A scientific theory set forth explain available data light new information
All often hear people agenda exclaim theory untested theory
There thing untested theory
What make hypothesis theory fact tested supported test result
The untested theory thus oxymoron I believe used deceive people scientific issue
Semiconductor theory fact complex scientific theory whose practical application computer browse site internet printer use print article television radio microwave oven telephone mobile phone satellite navigation etc possible complex scientific theory supported verifiable scientific fact repeatable scientific methodology
Professor Ian Plimer demonstrated debate Duane Gish pointing electricity like evolution theory challenging Gish use theory electricity demonstrate conviction theory conjecture
Gravity likewise theory albeit much simpler theory
Gravity fact instead theory used explain fact example drop ball always fall towards greatest mass planet Earth
The exclamation go must come popularly attributed Isaac Newton expression scientific fact tested anyone
However force gravity theory used explain fact
Evolution began hypothesis based hierarchy physiological relationship observed anatomy living creature Charles Darwin contemporary
Darwin proposed observation progressive expression anatomical feature time could prove hypothesis
This scientific fact known faunal progression
The fact faunal progression observed anyone keen enough learn palaeontology geology go look fossil occur stratigraphic order thus geological time
Faunal Progression fact prof evolution transforms evolution untested falsifiable hypothesis testable verified theory
The fact theory tested close case theory
It nature science theory always forever subject new information invalidated new evidence long useful theory come result evidence
It thought rate speciation constant biological process
However Steven Gould used study biological radiation geological history prove speciation occurs variable rate subject available diversity biologically viable environmental niche
The uniformitarian variant evolution disproved initially anecdotal cherry picked evidence
However science take one single anomalous verifiable fact disprove least require modification theory
The theory evolution thus evolved punctuated equilibrium theory evolution basis research effect various global parameter temperature oxygen carbon dioxide sea level cosmic radiation etc

Before agree publish work anyone please consider caveat
Authors article reasonable expectation retain copyright article published
This allows author put article web site include anthology later date even sell subsequent serial right another publisher later date
It work make copyright
Real publisher know better demand charity author
Real publisher know require first serial right syndication right order legalise publication given author work
As see publisher demand entire copyright work order make publication possible lying
If money involved
publisher get nice fat cheque every time someone buy electronic copy article online financial transaction transforms lie fraud criminal offense
If business criminal get burned
If nothing happens count lucky
There lot money article sale
Do afraid ask royalty return serial syndication right
The publisher refusal serf indicate better business someone respect right fruit work
Ultimately academic writer get money book article I show later empirical nature science render advantage given redundant
If write science correctly readership able verify without reassurance claim
You warned
In practice scientific article rigidly structured one might expect
However pay write clearly following well defined structure thoroughly address topic
In general one expect see abstract form introduction defining term outlining hypothesis source experimental bias description methodology presentation result conclusion discussing implication result addressing validity original hypothesis
It pay write clear abstract outline article
One guideline I come across suggests taking list heading subheading rendering short paragraph word
If describe main thesis article convincing manner structure article need improved heading subheading carry logical structure article without non sequitur gap
The introduction need called introduction take meaningful name perhaps something relevant hypothesis testing definition key aspect research
Here outline literature research conducted define new uncommonly used term necessary
Most importantly put forward hypothesis testing
It pay keep mind hypothesis need unambiguous fixed definition contingency hypothesis introduction place discus
If using software model apply hypothesis large amount data modelling program result might sufficient justification hypothesis mean sufficient basis conclusion
Results computer model need verified real data scientific theory formulated
The documentation method may minimal using standard well established methodology
However common scientific research stumble circumstance required special treatment necessary document method sufficient clarity repeated others
You also need justify method crediting procedure developed previous author citing science behind new approach choose adopt flawless logic
You credibly misconstrue computer model scientific method
Computer model strictly aid hypothesis lack sufficient empirical evidence support scientific theory
Formulas method treating otherwise calculating key variable result also documented section
It vital method data treatment documented applied universally without arbitrary manipulation
Arbitrary correction data made Mann et al
direct manipulation evidence eg
Morris Whiticomb unscientific lead fraud allegation Bird Milne Schafersman Plimer
Key result discussed result section without interpretation
At stage simply keep fact avoid interpretation presentation graph displaying key correlation trend lack thereof within result
It pay calculate correlation mathematically intend discus comparative correlation conclusion
You must document data obliged show due diligence acquiring sufficient data eliminate random skew data trend
Both failure exercise due diligence Eg
Wang et Jones et omission key data Eg
Setterfield generally lead fraud allegation eg
Price Plimer Keenan Discussion result trend correlation exercise logic
The importance logical integrity heightened interpretive nature part article
Flatly stating comparative difference apparent disgrace otherwise superb work eg
Royer et lead criticism eg
Shaviv Veizer may overlook important precedent close correlation carbon dioxide global mean temperature recent geological history observed Petit et al
cited last two example
When stating idea actually discovered research necessary credit individual research verifies idea
This ensures theory proposed based verified scientific theory verifiable scientific evidence
If idea supported research already proposed someone else still necessary credit original author
It also unacceptable recreate idea new terminology
If citation peer reviewed Eg
IPCC report constitutes insufficient evidence upon base theory unless offer conservative alternative peer reviewed finding demonstrating difference insufficient refute theory
It make sense also include result peer reviewed source offer perspective part basis theory
Royer et al
base title statement IPCC fails offer better evidence application false cause correlation Shaviv Veizer
This seriously undermines work credibility IPCC concocted fallacy
Peer review exists verify empirical rigor scientific breakthrough given breakthrough indeed scientifically rigorous ensure radical new idea published clear basis repeatable test verifiable evidence
In sense conservative mechanism method ensuring radical new idea support empirical evidence guaranteed public discussion
Ideally peer reviewer identify erroneous missing redundant citation
They also identify baseless statement logical error factual error interpretation The important aspect peer review verification scientific methodology criterion irrespective whether idea would otherwise considered respectable conventional acceptable
Nearly publication review process
Few publication formal process
The existence formal process confirmed four thing Although scientific publication claim process none meet criterion adequately
Of current publication Cornell University meet highest proportion requirement
A common misunderstanding publisher right censor anything like
However claiming process implicitly guarantee unbiased presentation academic literature turn deprive publisher right censor block publication paper like
In fact censorship journal claimed constitute violation trade practice law prof product sold thus academically journal fact academically unbiased therefore customer paying
Whenever journal engages censorship publisher committing crime known fraud investigator bait switch
Fraud criminal offense civilised country crime carry additional penalty accessory accomplice know crime committed fail report
If know publisher engaging censorship practice guise may legally obliged report publisher trade practice body whose jurisdiction journal produced
Peer review ensures credibility publication
That work would highly questionable absence redundant given empirical nature scientific claim make claim testable therefore eminently questionable
Without verifiability article scientific irrespective whether pass
Moreover history science show science proven incorrect past lack reliability reduced way stringent process
Part problem commonly make mistake treating original research paper sort exam paper regurgitating already established knowledge
The problem approach often new discovery get rejected simply raise new doubt established accepted idea
It often fail understand empirical nature science fail look beyond convention testability claim made
As consequence lot convincing rubbish slip past science much empirically solid material languishes fringe publication
It fact major discovery nineteenth century many published prestigious journal
Yet display alarming preponderance error
Scientists alike human
It therefore reader review read empirical rigor often betray
The beauty science empirical necessitates simple testability every claim made
If study history science primary source historical science paper mean distinguish science pseudoscience becomes blindingly obvious science stand test time always empirical core pseudoscience get debunked always theoretical core
Moreover nature revolutionary scientific leap amount historically little overturn long standing deeply entrenched theory simple overlooked fact even child could verify

If ask scientist make good experiment get specific answer method teasing causal relationship variable observables
If human observation involved may get detailed description blind experimental design
In contrast ask scientist make theory explanation scientific often get vague statement
Scientists usually good designing experiment test theory
We invent theoretical entity explanation time rarely stated way falsifiable
It also quite rare anything science stated form deductive argument
Experiments often done falsify theory provide weight repeated varied observation support theory
Sometimes even use word talking result experiment
What going
Is falsifiability standard
Or something else
The difference science deserves bit elaboration
It always obvious even scientist principle using evaluate scientific theory start discussion difference thinking Popper asymmetry
Consider scientific theory predicts observation
There two way could approach adding weight experiment particular theory
We could attempt falsify verify observation
Only one approach falsification deductively valid If If Popper concluded impossible know theory true based observation science tell u theory false yet refuted
He concluded meaningful scientific statement falsifiable
A realistic picture scientific theory simple
We often base theory set take postulate theory
For example theory liquid dynamic might depend whole classical mechanic taken postulate theory viral genetics might depend equilibrium
In case classical mechanic equilibrium auxiliary assumption specific theory
These auxiliary assumption help show science often deductively valid exercise
The thesis recovers symmetry falsification verification take account role auxiliary assumption theory If If That predicted observation turn false deduce something wrong conjunction determine premise rather false
In order recover asymmetry would need assumption independently verifiable If If Falsifying theory requires auxiliary assumption demonstrably true
Auxiliary assumption often highly theoretical remember auxiliary assumption might statement like
It important note verify able falsify using valid argument
Contrary Popper really asymmetry falsification verification
Since verifying theoretical statement nearly impossible falsification often requires verification assumption leave scientific theory
What required statement make scientific
Carl Hempel came one useful statement property scientific theory The statement constituting scientific explanation must capable empirical And statement exactly mean scientific brings u right back thing scientist good experimentation experimental design
If I propose scientific explanation phenomenon possible subject theory empirical test experiment
We also reasonable expectation empirical test
That multiple independent skeptical scientist able subject theory similar test different location different equipment different time get similar answer
scientific experiment therefore going required universality
So answer question might reproducibility If theory experiment two traditional leg science simulation fast becoming third leg
Modern science come rely computer simulation computational model computational analysis large data set
These method science
For simple system small data set nearly
As system become complex data set become large calculation reproducible principle longer reproducible practice without public access code data
If scientist make claim skeptic reproduce spending three decade writing debugging complex computer program exactly replicates working commercial code original claim really reproducible principle
If really want allow skeptic test claim must allow see working computer code used
It therefore imperative skeptical scientific inquiry software simulating complex system available form real access raw data made available skeptic
Our position open source open data science arrived increasing number paper began crossing desk review could subjected reproducibility test meaningful way
Paper A might used commercial package come license
Paper might use code requires parameter set trade secret
Our view healthy scientific paper supported computation reproduced except employee commercial software developer
It may may unless enough detail experimental methodology made available subjected true reproducibility test skeptic Science
Pingback If verify theoretical statement falsify either
Since verifying theoretical statement nearly impossible falsification often requires verification An invalid argument invalid regardless truth premise
I would suggest hypothesis based unverifiable assumption could falsified way argument unverifiable premise could shown invalid
Would agree
Falsifying theory requires auxiliary assumption AA demonstrably No requires true
In falisificationist method change AA long increase theory testability
theory includes AA universal statement btw
In second box misrepresent first derivation
conclusion would AA
either modify AA long increase theory falsifiability abandon theory
Therefore need third box explains something need explaining could explained concisely without error reconstructing process better
This process always tentative open risky critical nature conjecture refutation
Falsificationism pretend conclusiveness abandoned scrap heap along hopelessly defective interpretation science called inductivism
Contrary Popper really asymmetry falsification verification
If verify theoretical statement falsify There asymmetry
You refute asymmetry showing falsification conclusive
Because asymmetry logical relationship statement
What would shown argument valid accurate would falsification possible practice
Not asymmetry false
Popper wanted replace induction verification deduction falsification
He held theory accepted thanks novel experiment observation turn false confronts u new problem new solution needed
In view process hallmark scientific progress
Surprisingly Popper failed note despite effort present deductive process bottom inductive since assumes theory falsified today remain falsified tomorrow
Accepting swan either white black black one spotted rest assumption black swan around newly discovered black one become white later stage
It obvious also inductive thinking sense project past future extrapolate particular universal
In word induction process Popper determined avoid lie heart philosophy science defined
Despite positivism limitation science positive science positive science theory maybe incapable demonstration Hume wrote causation others available
If impossible demonstrate fire burn putting one hand painful
Required field marked

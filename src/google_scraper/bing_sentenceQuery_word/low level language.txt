A provides little computer function language map closely processor instruction
Generally refers either
The word low refers small nonexistent amount language machine language language sometimes described close hardware
Programs written language tend relatively mainly close relationship language specific hardware architecture
language convert machine code without compiler use simpler processor called resulting code run directly processor
A program written language made run quickly small
An equivalent program le efficient use memory
language simple considered difficult use due numerous technical detail programmer must remember
By comparison isolates execution semantics computer architecture specification program simplifies development
programming language sometimes divided two category
language computer process directly without previous transformation
Currently programmer almost never write program directly machine code requires attention numerous detail language handle automatically
Furthermore requires memorizing looking numerical code every instruction extremely difficult modify
True stream raw usually data
A programmer coding machine code normally code instruction data readable form translated internal format program called toggled computer memory
Although program written machine language programmer often become adept reading working debugging front panel
Example A function hexadecimal representation machine code calculate th language provide one abstraction level top machine code
In early day coding computer like first thing MIT hacker write assembler
little formal specification mapping symbol including symbolic address numeric constant
Typically one represented one line assembly code
Assemblers produce object file
Most assembler provide generate common sequence instruction
Example The calculator assembly language using syntax In code example hardware feature processor named manipulated directly
The function load input precise location byte higher location stored stack pointer performs calculation manipulating value register finished return
Note assembly language concept returning value
The result stored register command simply move code processing code location stored stack usually instruction immediately one called function author calling code know function store result retrieve
assembly language imposes standard returning value function fact concept function calling code examine state procedure return need extract value
Compare function C This code similar structure assembly language example significant difference term abstraction These abstraction make C code compilable without modification architecture C compiler written
The assembly language code specific architecture
In late language extended included degree access programming function
One method assembly code embedded language support feature
Some language also allow adjust way compiler us target processor architecture

A language programming language deal computer hardware component constraint
It minute level abstraction reference computer work manage computer operational semantics
A language may also referred computer native language
language designed operate handle entire hardware instruction set architecture computer directly
language considered closer computer
In word prime function operate manage manipulate computing hardware component
Programs application written language directly executable computing hardware without interpretation translation

submitted What difference programming language
I actually know program Java Python C idea difference
Also really mean
EDIT sentence structure Post comment
It relative part
The original meaning high level language language portable different machine structure later compiled specific architecture like C v pure assembly example C high level language
Nowadays applies language user managed memory like C provide runtime guarantee necessary embedded system critical application v garbage collected language like java even higher level interpreted language like python
That make lot sense thanks
This answer match classification I encountering lately opposed distant language machine code
The general definition would simply expressive power course relative task hand
Low level mean closer machine code assembly
The higher get layer abstraction programmer system Low level machine language CPU actually work
It corresponds directly logical operation performed silicon loading value register reading value memory jumping particular location memory etc
If look Assembly language look like really tough make sense operation granular
All High level language somehow converted low level operation
Back day straightforward case either compiling code one hit machine language interpreter convert high level code line line
These day tends bit complicated
For instance Java converted bytecode sort low level language run virtual machine interprets actual machine language
And usually simple
The high level look like actual language
A high level language allow stuff le code make abstraction technicality
Low level language allow fine tune underlying detail program
Low level basically mean language feature almost analogous feature provided hardware running
So super low level language like assembly would telling processor push certain bit onto stack etc whereas high level language might correspond directly machine instruction
For example could kinda consider Wolfram Alpha high level language tell want instead describing every step take get
The higher language le need tell computer
Generally trade away use high level language fine grained control computer generally performance

In strong detail
In comparison may use element easier use may automate even hide entirely significant area computing system
making process developing program simpler understandable relative language
The amount abstraction provided defines programming language
In programming language using commonly called
Examples autocodes
The first programming language designed computer created
However implemented time original contribution due largely isolated development although influenced language Superplan degree also Algol
The first really widespread language machine independent development IBM earlier system
defined committee European American computer scientist introduced well
It also first language clear distinction corresponding
Algol also introduced several concept construct first described formal method BNF
During roughly period introduced also called structs introduced fully general programming language first time
language refers higher level abstraction
Rather dealing register memory address call stack language deal variable array complex arithmetic boolean expression subroutine function loop lock abstract computer science concept focus optimal program efficiency
Unlike language language element translate directly machine native
Other feature string handling routine language feature file may also present
One thing note programming language language allows programmer detached separated machine
That unlike language like assembly machine language programming amplify programmer instruction trigger lot data movement background without knowledge
The responsibility power executing instruction handed machine programmer
language intend provide feature standardize common task permit rich debugging maintain architectural agnosticism language often produce efficient code optimization specific system architecture
border prevents programming technique applied situation computational limitation standard conformance physical constraint require access architectural resource fi response time hardware integration
programming exhibit feature like generic data interpretation intermediate code file often result execution far operation necessary higher memory consumption larger binary program size
For reason code need run particularly quickly efficiently may require use language even language would make coding easier
In many case critical portion program mostly language leading much faster efficient simply reliably functioning
However growing complexity modern architecture compiler language frequently produce code comparable efficiency programmer produce hand higher abstraction may allow powerful technique providing better overall result counterpart particular setting
language designed independent specific computing system architecture
This facilitates executing program written language computing system compatible support Interpreted program
language improved designer develop improvement
In case new language evolve one others goal aggregating popular construct new improved feature
An example maintains backward compatibility mean program library written Java continue usable even programming shop switch Scala make transition easier lifespan coding indefinite
In contrast program rarely survive beyond system architecture written without major revision
This engineering Penalty
Examples programming language active use today include many others
The term inherently relative
Some decade ago similar language often considered supported concept expression evaluation recursive function data type structure considered
Today many programmer might refer C lack large garbage collection etc
basically support scalar operation provides direct memory addressing
It therefore readily blend assembly language machine level
Assembly language may regarded higher level often still used without representation support concept constant limited expression sometimes even variable procedure
turn inherently slightly higher level used internally many processor
There three general mode execution modern language Note language strictly interpreted language compiled language
Rather implementation language behavior use interpretation compilation
For example interpreted even though typically compiled
Similarly Java show difficulty trying apply label language rather implementation Java compiled bytecode bytecode subsequently executed either interpretation compilation typically compiler JVM
Moreover compilation interpretation strictly limited description compiler artifact binary executable IL assembly
Alternatively possible language directly implemented computer computer directly executes HLL code
This known designed targeted specific language


What difference high level language machine language
And difference impact coding
Python Perl Haskell Lua many programming language high level language
When code language use familiar concept example loop data store
However code processed computer different often unfamiliar concept binary number machine language
These internal detail hidden high level language
For example need know assign data specific memory register computer assign value variable PHP
Where high level language come
Machine language first computer programming language evolved assembly language evolved high level language
Machine language deal directly register store data memory address computer hardware
Assembly language work specific computer processor environment
Assembly language compiled converted machine code software utility called assembler
The machine code run computer
In contrast high level language work many different operating system deal variable array abstract idea easily understood human
The conversion high level machine code transparent coder people use software created high level programming language
There useful detail know high level programming language executed work internally work data

Just human use language communicate different region different language computer also language specific
Different kind language developed perform different type work computer
Basically language divided two category according computer understands
There also type language include These language mutually exclusive language belong multiple category
The term also open interpretation language considered considered language continued develop
computer language either machine code close
A computer understand instruction given language English
It understand execute instruction given form machine language
binary
There two type language Machine language lowest elementary level programming language first type programming language developed
Machine language basically language computer understand usually written hex
In fact manufacturer design computer obey one language machine code represented inside computer string binary digit bit
The symbol stand absence electric pulse stand presence electric pulse
Since computer capable recognizing electric signal understands machine language
Assembly language developed overcome many inconvenience machine language
This another important language operation code operand given form alphanumeric symbol instead l
These alphanumeric symbol known mnemonic code combine maximum combination
ADD addition SUB subtraction START LABEL etc
Because feature assembly language also known Symbolic Programming Language
This language also difficult need lot practice master little English support language
Mostly assembly language used help compiler orientation
The instruction assembly language converted machine code language translator executed computer
computer language use format similar English
The purpose developing language enable people write program easily native language environment English
language basically symbolic language use English word mathematical symbol rather mnemonic code
Each instruction language translated many machine language instruction computer understand
Many language developed achieving variety different task
Some fairly specialized others quite general
These language categorized according use These language oriented towards computational procedure solving mathematical statistical problem
Examples include These language best able maintain data processing procedure problem involved handling file
Some example include These used string manipulation including search pattern inserting deleting character
Examples In OOP computer program divided object

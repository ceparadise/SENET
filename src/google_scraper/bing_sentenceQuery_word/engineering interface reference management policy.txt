Engineering existed since ancient time human devised invention wedge lever wheel pulley
The term derived word date back literally one operates referred constructor military engine
In context obsolete engine referred military machine mechanical contraption used war example
Notable example obsolete usage survived present day military engineering corp
The word engine even older origin ultimately deriving meaning innate quality especially mental power hence clever invention
Later design civilian structure bridge building matured technical discipline term entered lexicon way distinguish specializing construction project involved discipline
The among many others stand testament ingenuity skill ancient civil military engineer
Other monument longer standing important engineering achievement time considered among
The earliest civil engineer known name
As one official probably designed supervised construction around
developed machine civilian military domain
The first known mechanical example early mechanical engineering
Some Archimedes invention well Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge two key principle machine theory helped design Industrial Revolution still widely used today diverse field
Ancient Chinese Greek Roman Hungarian army employed military machine invention developed Greeks around century
In Middle Ages developed
The first built
The development device gave rise coming decade allowing beginning
With rise engineering century term became narrowly applied field mathematics science applied end
Similarly addition military civil engineering field known became incorporated engineering
The invention gave rise modern
The development specialized machine industrial revolution led rapid growth mechanical engineering birthplace abroad
first civil engineer often regarded father
He English responsible design
He also capable eminent
Smeaton designed third pioneered use form set water developed technique involving dovetailed block granite building lighthouse
His lighthouse remained use dismantled partially rebuilt known
He important history rediscovery development modern identified compositional requirement needed obtain hydraulicity lime work led ultimately invention
The United States census listed occupation engineer first time count
There fewer engineering graduate
In dozen mechanical engineering graduate number increasing per year
In engineer civil mining mechanical electrical
There chair applied mechanism applied mechanic Cambridge chair engineering Oxford
Germany established technical university earlier
The foundation included experiment others invention
The theoretical work see late century gave rise field
The later invention accelerated development electronics extent electrical electronics engineer currently outnumber colleague engineering specialty
developed late nineteenth century
Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new material new process need large scale production chemical new industry created dedicated development large scale manufacturing chemical new industrial plant
The role chemical engineer design chemical plant process
Aeronautical engineering deal design modern term expands reach discipline including design
Its origin traced back aviation pioneer around start century although work recently dated last decade century
Early knowledge aeronautical engineering largely empirical concept skill imported branch engineering
The first engineering technically awarded United States went also second PhD awarded science Only decade successful flight extensive development aeronautical engineering development military aircraft used
Meanwhile research provide fundamental background science continued combining experiment
In rise technology first built
Engineering broad discipline often broken several
Although engineer usually trained specific discipline may become experience
Engineering often characterized four main branch
application physic chemistry biology engineering principle order carry chemical process commercial scale
design construction public private work water supply treatment etc
dam building
Civil engineering traditionally broken number including
It traditionally considered separate
design study manufacture various electrical electronic system device system instrumentation control
design manufacture physical mechanical system power system product product vacuum technology equipment
Beyond Big Four number branch recognized though many thought four major branch discipline among multiple
Historically major branch
Other engineering field sometimes included major branch
These branch engineering represented licensed member institution UK
New specialty sometimes combine traditional field form new branch example involves wide range subject area including
One practice engineering called licensed may formal designation
In process engineer apply mathematics science physic find novel solution problem improve existing solution
More ever engineer required proficient knowledge relevant science design project
As result many engineer continue learn new material throughout career
If multiple solution exist engineer weigh design choice based merit choose solution best match requirement
The crucial unique task engineer identify understand interpret constraint design order yield successful result
It generally insufficient build technically successful product rather must also meet requirement
Constraints may include available resource physical imaginative technical limitation flexibility future modification addition factor requirement cost marketability productivity
By understanding constraint engineer derive limit within viable object system may produced operated
A general methodology engineering inferred historical case study comment provided Walter Vincenti
Though Vincenti case study domain aeronautical engineering conclusion transferred many branch engineering
According Billy Vaughn Koen use heuristic cause best change poorly understood situation within available resource
Koen argues definition make one engineer based produce rather go
Engineers use knowledge find suitable solution problem
Creating appropriate problem often allows analyze sometimes definitively test potential solution
Usually multiple reasonable solution exist engineer must evaluate different merit choose solution best meet requirement
gathering statistic large number suggested heart engineering design higher level best design one eliminates core contradiction causing problem
Engineers typically attempt predict well design perform specification prior production
They use among thing
Testing ensures product perform expected
Engineers take responsibility producing design perform well expected cause unintended harm public large
Engineers typically include design reduce risk unexpected failure
However greater safety factor le efficient design may
The study failed product known help evaluating design light real condition
The discipline greatest value disaster careful analysis needed establish cause cause failure
As modern scientific technological endeavor computer software play increasingly important role
As well typical business number computer aided application specifically engineering
Computers used generate model fundamental physical process solved using
One widely used profession CAD software like DSS enables engineer create model drawing schematic design
CAD together DMU software allows engineer create model design analyzed without make expensive physical prototype
These allow product component checked flaw ass fit assembly study ergonomics analyze static dynamic characteristic system stress temperature electromagnetic emission electrical current voltage digital logic level fluid flow kinematics
Access distribution information generally organized use software
There also many tool support specific engineering task CAM software generate machining instruction software production engineering PCB circuit electronic engineer application maintenance management software civil engineering
In recent year use computer software aid development good collectively come known PLM
The engineering profession engages wide range activity large collaboration societal level also smaller individual project
Almost engineering project obligated sort financing agency company set investor government
The type engineering minimally constrained issue engineering engineering
By nature engineering interconnection society culture human behavior
Every product construction used modern society influenced engineering
The result engineering activity influence change environment society economy application brings responsibility public safety
Engineering project subject controversy
Examples different engineering discipline include development design use extraction
In response western engineering company enacted serious policy
Engineering key driver innovation human development
Africa particular small engineering capacity result many African nation unable develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid
The attainment many requires achievement sufficient engineering capacity develop infrastructure sustainable technological development
All overseas development relief NGOs make considerable use engineer apply solution disaster development scenario
A number charitable organization aim use engineering directly good mankind Engineering company many established economy facing significant challenge regard number professional engineer trained compared number retiring
This problem prominent UK engineering poor image low status
There many negative economic political issue cause well ethical issue
It widely agreed engineering profession face image crisis rather fundamentally unattractive career
Much work needed avoid huge problem UK western economy
Many established code practice guide member inform public large
The code ethic state Engineering important learned profession
As member profession engineer expected exhibit highest standard honesty integrity
Engineering direct vital impact quality life people
Accordingly service provided engineer require honesty impartiality fairness equity must dedicated protection public health safety welfare
Engineers must perform standard professional behavior requires adherence highest principle ethical conduct
In Canada many engineer wear symbol reminder obligation ethic associated profession
There exists overlap science engineering practice engineering one applies science
Both area endeavor rely accurate observation material phenomenon
Both use mathematics classification criterion analyze communicate observation
Scientists may also complete engineering task designing experimental apparatus building prototype
Conversely process developing technology engineer sometimes find exploring new phenomenon thus becoming moment scientist precisely engineering scientist
In book Walter Vincenti asserts engineering research character different scientific research
First often deal area basic well understood problem complex solve exact manner
There real important difference engineering physic similar science field technology
Physics exploratory science seek knowledge principle Engineering us knowledge practical application principle
The former equates understanding mathematical principle latter measure variable involved creates technology
For technology physic auxiliary way technology considered applied physic
Though physic engineering interrelated mean physicist trained engineer job
A physicist would typically require additional relevant training
Physicists engineer engage different line work
But PhD physicist specialize sector titled Technology officer R D Engineers System Engineers
An example use numerical approximation describe aerodynamic flow aircraft use calculate fatigue damage
Second engineering research employ many foreign pure scientific research one example method parameter variation
As stated Fung revision classic engineering text Engineering quite different science
Scientists try understand nature
Engineers try make thing exist nature
Engineers stress innovation invention
To embody invention engineer must put idea concrete term design something people use
That something complex system device gadget material method computing program innovative experiment new solution problem improvement already exists
Since design realistic functional must geometry dimension characteristic data defined
In past engineer working new design found required information make design decision
Most often limited insufficient scientific knowledge
Thus studied mathematics physic chemistry biology mechanic
Often add science relevant profession
Thus engineering science born
Although engineering solution make use scientific principle engineer must also take account safety efficiency economy reliability constructability ease fabrication well environment ethical legal consideration patent infringement liability case failure solution
The study human body albeit different direction different purpose important common link medicine engineering discipline
aim sustain repair enhance even replace function necessary use
Modern medicine replace several body function use artificial organ significantly alter function human body artificial device example
The field medical bionics dedicated study synthetic implant pertaining natural system
Conversely engineering discipline view human body biological machine worth studying dedicated emulating many function replacing technology
This led field
There also substantial interdisciplinary interaction engineering medicine
Both field provide solution real world problem
This often requires moving forward phenomenon completely understood rigorous scientific sense therefore experimentation knowledge integral part
Medicine part study function human body
The human body biological machine many function modeled using engineering method
The heart example function much like pump skeleton like linked structure lever brain produce etc
These similarity well increasing importance application engineering principle medicine led development field us concept developed discipline

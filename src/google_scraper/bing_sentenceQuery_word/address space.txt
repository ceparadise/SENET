In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine

In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given

Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word

Well general question
And anyone want make implementation specific I prefer Unix related stuff
But first need know following problem generality I read single process multiple thread
Multiple thread process share thing among
I want know share
Considering process comprised address space stack heap global variable code data OS resource among shared thread
I following guessing I read thread share global variable
Also programming Java C I made thread share class level variable
So I believing thread share global variable though sure whether concept high level programming language translates low operating system level fact
Since global variable stored heap heap shared among thread
Since thread execution must stack might program counter content say function call return happen
So thread process share stack
Now I unsure sharing following thing Not sure exactly count address space
But I guess address space generally used context process thread
And since thread process reside address space parent process said thread share address space
But maintain different stack inside address space
I guess implementation specific
For example parent process selective give handle file thread
Or I mistaking OS resource mean something file
Threads different code sharing code always case
Unsure consider data
But sure global variable shared among thread
And sure local variable similarly shared
Overall I considerably confused due vague term done Operating Systems book specific detail provided online
So I trying find answer satisfy
In general register including program counter stack pointer stack
Everything else shared thread sharing process
In particular generally considered consist set thread sharing address space heap static data code segment file descriptor
An simply mapping logical address specific piece physical memory
So say thread process share address space mean accessing variable global scope thread see variable
Similarly thread may running different point code particular time permitted call global function correspond function every thread process
Most modern operating system added notion variable global scope shared
The usual example use variable
That single variable global scope modern operating system thread given local copy error library call one thread wo impact behavior thread
There additional process state shared thread process thing like process id signal handling file lock
For complete list process state shared thread need look documentation specific threading implementation
For example
That depends
If consider thread defined POSIX offered Unix system Windows familiar later ask specifically give answer essentially WanderingLogic answer explains
Linux idea thread using system call
It offer rather control parent child share
It go far essentially wrapper around internal calling specific flag create thread share next nothing parent
Look manual page detail available

Yes Linux offer POSIX style thread much besides
Threads come two perspective operating system programming language
In case variation attribute thread
A minimal definition thread stuff happens sequence one thing another
In typical machine execution model thread set register program counter
If machine set specific register stack pointer one copy per thread
From operating system perspective minimum operating system need support thread provide way switch
This happen either automatically thread make explicit request cooperative multitasking case thread sometimes called
There also hybrid model preemption cooperative yield
preemption thread different group task explicit yield thread
Switching thread involves minimum saving register value old thread restoring register value new thread
In multitasking operating system provides treat term synonym OS context task resource particular address space also open file privilege etc
Isolation provided operating system entity process
Each task normally least one thread task execute code much use
The operating system may may support multiple thread task example original Unix
A task still run multiple thread arranging switch require special privilege
This called especially Unix context
Nowadays Unix system provide kernel thread particular way multiple thread process running different processor
Most operating system resource apart computation time attached task thread
Some operating system example Linux explicitly delimit stack case thread OSes kernel know anything stack part heap far concerned
The kernel also typically manages kernel context thread data structure containing information thread currently let kernel handle multiple thread blocked system call time
As far operating system concerned thread task run code different position code different program counter value
It may may happen certain part code program always executed specific thread usually common code
utility function called thread
All thread see data otherwise considered different task data accessed particular thread usually solely purview programming language operating system
In programming language storage shared thread program
This model concurrent programming popular also programmer need careful data accessed multiple thread occur
Note even local variable shared thread usually mean variable whose name valid one execution function another thread obtain pointer variable access
There also programming language thread storage communication happens sending message communication channel
This model concurrent programming
main programming language focus message passing execution environment lightweight handling thread encourages program written many thread contrast programming language creating thread relatively expensive operation runtime environment ca support large number thread time
Erlang sequential subset part language happens within thread particular data manipulation mostly purely functional thus thread send message another thread containing data neither thread need worry data modified thread using
Some language blend two model offering storage without type system distinguish storage location global one
storage usually convenience feature allows variable name designate different storage location different thread
Some difficult may interest understand thread By posting answer agree

A contiguous block described single entry
It smallest unit data memory management virtual memory
Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation
Starting processor support MiB page called MiB page using addition standard KiB page newer processor newer processor later processor use GiB page
support many eight different page size KiB MiB architecture similar feature
Larger page despite available processor used contemporary common use except application application typically found large server operating system
Commonly use requires elevated privilege cooperation application making large allocation usually setting flag ask operating system huge page manual administrator configuration operating system commonly sometimes design page disk
However support multiple page size
Each individual process provide hint operating system automatically use largest page size possible given region address space
supported huge page several architecture since series via filesystem without hugetlbfs since
newer support huge page name page
support large page internally expose application
beginning version support large page
FreeBSD feature superpages
Note recently Linux application needed modified order use huge page
The kernel introduced support transparent use huge page
On Linux kernel supporting transparent huge page well FreeBSD Solaris application take advantage huge page automatically without need modification

An address space relation computing refers number discrete address correspond physical logical entity computer like network host peripheral device disc sector memory cell etc
Allocation range number IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority various registry enables manage particular address space
The internet domain taken example Address space work computing
two main component address space computing
While former refers address generated central processing unit CPU latter address loaded memory address register memory
This first difference two address space
sometimes also referred virtual address
Technically defined address item appears reside perspective executing application program
These item consist memory cell storage element network host etc
In order serve different purpose physical address computer memory bank mapped logical virtual address
It may happen physical memory appear two different logical address
When accessed program one address data tend pas processor cache hand accessed address tend bypass
In system support virtual memory physical memory may mapped unless demanded access attempted
When attempt made function begin operating system reprogram MMU aid mapping address physical memory new logical address
This case referred virtual address
hand memory address usually represented form binary number computer address bus
It enables data bus access particular storage cell main memory
This form address also known real address binary address
also different respect
The former Logical address space refers set logical address generated program
Physical address space hand set physical address correspond logical address
Any run time mapping virtual physical address done memory management unit
With reference user program said real space never shown user program
On hand always deal logical address
On ground similarity logical physical address compile load time address binding scheme
The two though differ execution time address binding scheme

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I try solve exercise unfortunately without success yet
From following given information virtual address space calculated My idea find many page addressed
The page count lead size virtual address space right
Virtual address space page size page count As far I understand page count defined logical address size
The logical address split level page table plus offset
Due page table entry size byte bit bit logical address used stage address
The offset size bit
Each page stage address bit plus bit offset
So result page count
Page count With page size page count I get virtual address space
I think wrong
It much larger
What correct
Any help appreciated
Since Logical address size bit mean logical address space byte assuming system byte addressable
Otherwise general logical address given also found
From information assuming entire page used Now consider outermost page table
It entry mean second level page table page page entry
Going logic derived number page process logical address space And given page size KB Therefore logical address space size KB byte By posting answer agree

In initiate action action INSERT DELETE UPDATE occurs
Since trigger specialized procedure stored managed DBMS
A trigger DBMS automatically fire trigger result data modification associated table
Triggers used maintain referential integrity data changing data systematic fashion
Each trigger attached single specified database
Triggers viewed similar consist procedural logic stored database level
Stored procedure however attached specific table trigger
Stored procedure explicitly executed invoking CALL procedure trigger implicitly executed
In addition trigger also execute stored procedure
A trigger also contain INSERT UPDATE DELETE logic within trigger fired data modification also cause another data modification thereby firing another trigger
A trigger contains data modification logic within called

In series Part I addressed Risk Identification
In Part I addressed Risk Probability Impact Exposure
In entry I discus concept Risk Trigger
An important aspect Risk Management knowing detecting risk occurred
This know Risk Trigger
In case may obvious
An example would risk If project team loses key resource A task estimate assigned A need extended may impact key milestone commitment
In case PM know lost key resource
However case large project team key resource may embedded deep project hierarchy hiding loss unless communication plan notify PM Your risk trigger must define method use monitor risk
For example possible change government regulation impact project engage Legal team monitor status regulation regular basis report change directly PM
Here another example risk server capacity insufficient meet peak demand might direct technical team establish monitor CPU disk usage raise flag approaching safe limit
The lesson assume know risk occurred
Define Risk Triggers even obvious one risk
Now know risk exposure occur next step manage mitigation contingency plan
I tackle topic upcoming post

Christopher taught college level information technology IT security master degree Information Security hold numerous industry certification
A really anything computer may damage steal data allow someone else access computer without knowledge consent
There lot different thing create computer risk including general term used describe many type bad software
We commonly think computer virus several type bad software create computer security risk including virus worm ransomware spyware Trojan horse
Misconfiguration computer product well unsafe computing habit also pose risk
Let look detail
malware attached file system may used destroy data
Viruses many capability unlike worm usually require human interaction spread system system even user unaware spreading
like virus ability spread computer computer
They know attach portable storage device like USB drive removable hard drive move network automatically moving connected machine
relatively new term malware installed system make file unreadable holding data hostage pay hacker ransom
Ransomware may delivered virus worm guarantee even pay ransom get data restored
malware steal data may used spy using webcam microphone without knowledge
Once spyware installed may steal sensitive data recording login information use looking sensitive file computer sending data back attacker
In recent month hacker able access webcam microphone computer use picture video audio recording blackmail victim
special kind virus
Like famed wooden horse used Greeks infiltrate walled city Troy Trojan horse virus used deliver type malware hiding inside program file look legitimate
Most operating system today come sort firewall many tool normally referred protection suite protect computer

Get FREE access day create account
These item work properly configured
Improper incomplete configuration product may create computer security risk
For example program need updated regularly
As new virus released software need updated block new virus attempt infect computer
If misconfigured may get required update put computer risk
This hold true operating system well
Microsoft example release security patch fix every Tuesday
These patch fix part operating system working designed contain new functionality protect new threat discovered operating system
If system patched mean new vulnerability available hacker creates computer security risk
We probably heard click link email unknown source
As tool gotten smarter attacker find new way infecting computer
may able block software installed automatically voluntarily install infected software may catch
Clicking link unknown untrusted source installing software loaned given u without proper licensing security procedure downloading software source official vendor could lead computer infected malware data stolen hacker
These unsafe computing habit create computer security risk
A anything may cause damage confidentiality integrity availability data
Computer security risk created bad software infect computer destroy file steal data allow attacker gain access system without knowledge authorization
Examples malware include virus worm ransomware spyware Trojan horse
Misconfigured software unpatched operating system unsafe computer habit contribute creating computer security risk

The case making computer science high school requirement After entire weekend spent reading I sat frustrated literally wanting bang head wall
I year old week first computer science class ever I idea I would able successfully finish project class assigned
We told build Gumball Machine Python professor way putting cutesy spin u learning code series arbitrary requirement
The program build would randomly choose number assigned color gumballs
There specific number color seven yellow eight green three blue importantly one red
The program would run continuously choosing gumball gumball reached sole red gumball
At point would tally total number point every gumball chose give total number point round
While Gumball Machine meant simple program figuring create one anything
Learning first programming language lot like learning first foreign language creating program run smoothly like fluent conversation native
The computer unforgiving slightest mistake usually wo even tell wrong
You figure usually series maddening bout trial error
After desperate countless attempt every various formula I could throw terminal I finally ran program thing I wanted
At last I spoke fluently without even much misplaced preposition
And sense pride I felt completing first assignment many followed feeling subject like math English science never provided
This long arduous process learning code might sound crazy even pointless face Gumball Machine certainly pointless exactly people learn computer science
I always good math science first computer science class I actually found skill useful interesting way
And I think safe say I alone assessment
But brogrammer stereotype everywhere many people fit accepted nerdy male stereotype deterred pursuing valuable skill I know I one
My high school offered computer science field demographic kept away college
And woman still pursuing computer science far fewer number hit college Statistics show woman held percent bachelor degree awarded accounted percent degree awarded computer science lowest share STEM field
Clearly diversity problem tech industry one need solution go deeper initiative hire woman minority
The real challenge encouraging dive computer science course first place case perhaps best encouragement come form requirement
Making computer science class mandatory public school would simply help diverse array student get interested programming would also teach student use brain way school subject allows
As field computer science constantly evolving mean student also learn importance autodidactism
The first web programming language I learned PHP considered almost relic
But two year ago
The professor taught PHP warned class fact
It nature field said
So job much teach program teach teach program
In world changing quickly autodidactism incredibly valuable skill
Learning computer science teach think way expands ability skill useful student regardless field go pursue
But choose pursue career computer science also higher earning potential
On average people know code city like New York San Francisco make percent citywide median salary
While would likely le premium people know code computer science became requirement upped earning potential demonstrate useful skill across board entire workforce could benefit teaching everyone skill
Of course implementing computer science requirement would easy
The logistical implication involved kind nationwide educational restructuring would costly
But mean doable
One biggest hurdle cited issue kind reform recruiting teacher
According mean annual wage software developer mean annual wage secondary school teacher
So teacher supposed come
A grassroots program called Technology Education And Literacy Schools used school across state provides answer
Volunteer programmer teach computer science class high school helping teacher learn create program
Though specific program would necessarily able match scale nationwide requirement would demand approach signal solution teacher taught program rather programmer taught teach
Obviously specific tricky
But benefit would far outweigh adoption cost
It secret falling behind education particularly math science
And guess big factor lack innovation incorporated education even face much evolution field real world
Requiring student learn computer science much improved career prospect improving nation literacy field key global future
The skill computer science education teach beneficial every modern occupation limited people fit brogrammer stereotype
It time American education system whole woman minority included catch rest world
And despite hurdle computer science requirement best way accomplish

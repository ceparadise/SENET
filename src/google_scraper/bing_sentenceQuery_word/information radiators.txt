Wise strategic use computer information technology give business competitive advantage help government agency serve client efficiently well
information system become critical organization strategy surrounding integral organization broader strategy
Because professional field typically demand educational program like Information Systems major traditionally enjoyed strong direct link field professional community
Information system field academic study began year first use computer information processing organization
As organization extended use information technology operational process decision support competitive strategy academic field also grew scope depth
During period growth change different name gained lost currency definition field enlarged
The simple term information system IS become commonly accepted generic term describe discipline
Still academic field go host label reflecting historical development various perspective emphasis among information system expert teacher
Here term As academic field Information Systems encompasses two broad area As information system expert would share broad responsibility develop implement manage infrastructure information technology computer communication data internal external system track new information technology help incorporate organization strategy planning practice support departmental individual information technology system
As science Computer Science primarily concerned discovering new knowledge strong foundation theory selected application domain
The field basis software engineering chemistry form basis chemical engineering physic basis electrical engineering
Some important topic science theory data structure algorithm programming language network operating system compiler database architecture artificial intelligence robotics graphic
The computer science program Saint Michael strong emphasis software development software engineering
To better understand emphasis consider following definition Engineering building useful product real people development solution technical problem within economic social technical constraint condition uncertainty

submitted Been reading article idea seems sound instead radiator computer system designed like radiator part network crunch stuff get heat
As layman idea sound sensible idea go Engineering Computing sciencers think
Post comment
It work probably practical
Computers generate heat efficiently
Practically every joule energy put computer end heat coming one component
So idea use computer instead regular electric radiator quite natural
The development described article involve customer buying system installing home company pay electricity order run computation machine
The first problem summer
Little heating needed period large part world
The article mention system server exhaust leading wall take heat away needed
This put considerably constraint location server placed house involve additional work cost create exhaust system
The option simply turn device would mean computational power network almost summer undesirable company seeking use network
The next issue protection hardware data
The machine said data encrypted bet money people trying hack device see kind creative thing done
As company using network computation would break problem way heavily parallelized computation one step depend outcome another
Furthermore requirement completion time sequence different part completed relatively loose since never know specific machine available due outage simply turned
Finally issue longevity
year computer hardware evolved considerably computation probably available much lower energy cost
Why would company still use purchased year back relatively inefficient compared latest greatest
This requires customer upgrade new model every year order radiator still interesting place run computation
Because limitation I see idea taking
But technically speaking totally feasible
deleted Aside many practical limitation technology mentioned also fact converting electrical energy heat extremely wasteful process causing significant increase entropy
Electrical heating indeed rather wasteful company going use computer power anyway useful place heat generated computer going useful rather data center additional power used get rid heat
Computers generate heat efficiently
If primary goal heat house quite true
Computers give one joule heat every joule electricity
That
A heat pump get
In place Norway resistive heating illegal efficiency deemed bad
In place Norway resistive heating illegal efficiency deemed bad
Not true buy kind resistive heater Norway using illegal
There might kind regulation regarding office complex something I aware though
Source I Norwegian
Sorry I got info another Norwegian
Maybe referring sort building code
Floor heating often us resistive heating also known heating cable
Also state AK illegal construction many electric heater overloaded grid multiple time
They also world largest grid battery backup Or since I
Decentralized model though idea using server would otherwise sit separate building probably air conditioned would instead complex home people would use pay bandwidth electricity making heat would net energy gain including additional infrastructure cost v efficiency come scaling standalone server farm
How something get joule heat per joule electricity
Heat pump magic
Seriously though thing running air conditioner refrigerator reverse blowing hot air house cool air outside
The efficiency limited
Actual efficiency
It transport heat one volume care
outside another volume care
home
That transportation come energy cost run compressor basically le actual thermal energy transporting
So I understand correctly generate joule heat joule electricity rather us joule electricity move existing heat location desired outcome joule heat per joule electricity cost paid completely different system Bingo If primary goal heat house A heat pump get
If trying heat house source heat readily available heat pump open window
I trying ornery I think I missing whatever point trying make
Because heat source much lower temperature useful one
Lots useful heat available air
Opening window decrease temperature difference inside outside
A heat pump difference
When add compression expansion refrigerant work get transition heat pump still heat home freezing outside
As long medium usually air water warmer evaporator transfer heat energy refrigerant released passing compressor condenser coil
Edit Word
Missing
Sentence
Poor refrigerant stuff AC pump around lower freezing temperature rapidly expands compression inside radiator
make outside even colder
look carnot cycle Heat pump aptly named pump heat outside house
As long outside absolute zero heat pump
Caveat heat pump home going able pump heat air Kelvin never asked
Because moving heat around heat pump efficient creating heat directly
Because outside thermal energy lower temperature therefore naturally flow inside
The inside thermal energy constantly transferring outside fact
The role heat pump force natural tendency push otherwise unavailable thermal energy inside
Look refrigeration cycle
Basically taking coolant system compressing superheating vapor Then removing heat condenser coolant cooled liquid pressure change evaporator absorbs heat house building
And going former step btu would using resistive heating
A heat pump revers cycle heating
I misunderstanding something run heater efficiency
It seems like joule electricity get joule heat
You move heat around moving joule heat cost lot le joule
This called heat pump
You one fridge thats back fridge warm
In place Norway resistive heating illegal efficiency deemed bad
This electric heater creating excessive demand power grid used something cheaper alternative
also total effciency nowhere close
First conversion efficiency power plant around generating station Then take account transmission loss
Furthermore electric heater end sending unused electrical energy back line word small significant voltage difference neutral cold prong heater neutral outlet breaker panel
None applies natural gas fired wood fired central heating unit
With modern heat exchanger design typically order efficient
Well
I living degree North Norway least people havent gotten around buying yet
Resistive heating definitely illegal since even heat pump heating house may still need normal radiator room
But right far efficient I cant believe people havent bought yet
If primary goal heat house quite true
Computers give one joule heat every joule electricity
That low
A heat pump get
Technically heat pump generate heat merely transport one location another
Of course practice really matter like heat short supply
Technically say heat pump generated heat said get joule heat per joule expended seems completely correct
I live Norway tell resistive heating I pretty much every room heat pump expensive
Are heater really illegal
I never heard
diverting heat water heater
Even summer still need hot water
Also Ireland
It nearly end may still need bit heating day
expands bit efficiency heat output PC space heater wattage
Do like door wood furnace using water transfer heat house winter let run summer
Hot tub summer
It strike decent idea need different context
The main problem distributed nature heating thousand house
That cause security efficiency installation problem
What ought use heat centralized location
For example hook server farm greenhouse cooler climate keep warm winter
Actually Denmark Apple going construct new data center hooked district heating network order supply local area residential heating
If infrastructure allows pretty smart way manage server heat
Source second last paragraph
Another huge issue willing put hassle running computer
I read article mentioned server intended processing operation opposed storing data
What someone made one radiator simply mined bitcoins
During winter could turn heat make money process
In summer could choose whether run
Mining bitcoins nowadays yield little cash electricity put
You need place electricity incredibly cheap make money cost electricity
And even tight margin
I trying profit persay use bitcoin mining offset cost heating save money
Everyone turning node hot day would quite inconvenient Coupling municipal heating plant somesuch would better idea imo le uncontrolled variable keep hardware easily accesible
The computer radiator would air vent outside discarding unwanted heat
But I agree connecting server hall municipal heating system seems lot smarter
This done facebook server hall northern Sweden
Its doubtful vent get rid enough heat prevent warming room noticeably
It would make summer compatible cluster worth even everyone else turn
If good use computing capability certainly worth need heater better spending penny per watt heat output traditional electrical heater ten dollar per watt useless computing power
This would better question watt power drawn make watt heat
There difference heater computer
Heat pump
Mentioned elsewhere thread
They give joule heat per joule electricity
They basically move heat outside inside
Go store budget goal obtaining watt heating possible
I bet person go electric heater store lot better person go Micro Center
If goal heat buy CPU
If goal generate heat lot computing great get CPU
Sure
You buy watt electric heater USD shop around let say impatient grab first one shelf make
You ca even buy appropriate PSU case amount never mind hardware powerful enough use
It would cool something useful heat computer pretty efficient managing heat trying produce le
Something scale however probably cost effective
You probably need lot infrastructure use heat datacenter anything worth
Heat kind industry brought house water pipe
It old widespread way using heat
I talking getting heat datacenter house
Datacenters public place tend middle nowhere various reason
Also equipment actually collect heat datacenter would likely require engineering
In Netherlands actually trying
The idea node server radiator inside home hardly store data get encrypted input compute give result back
They generate watt get money first place
The idea cooling costly server park distributed node cooled spot
It still discovery phase though
removed I know way consolidate lukewarm heat reach higher useful temperature

Not disagree would almost certainly waste money time
Well I approach wrong everyone
If I wrong feel free call
The worst happen I learn something
I read link
I insanely curious physic I never truly understood heat pump anyway
Thanks
I could see used public building lukewarm air useful
To maintain indoor air quality IAQ certain amount fresh air need taken depending occupancy total square footage
In place like MN outdoor air cold winter instead keeping air warm air may zero
There quite system run vented outgoing air past sort heat exchanger try warm fresh air much possible free
The actually work way hot outside try precool fresh air vented air
Schools public place already get paid telecom cell tower building
Though quite bit different potentially physical access hardware deal sensitive data
I got surfing buddy maintains building HVAC system
He told use water cooling tower evaporative system cool building dehumidify
The weird part system run year round
When need heat crank localized heating element cooling system continues run
I got thing going
If put auto mode crank temperature still run AC compressor matter
Annoying
I think using outside air cool server probably good idea
Cold air north definitely seems dry I willing bet someone come along say need dehumidified blasted datacenter
People equipment generate surprising amount heat
Something like datacenter large amount heat generated relatively small amount people
Compared something like school lot people little equipment
Which mean le fresh air need exchanged datacenter since much le buildup
body standard sort thing
The reason AC compressor run especially defrost vehicle dehumidify
In case cooling overcome heater core function humidification
Air conditioning necessarily cooling
Cooling nice air dry keep nasties growing inside building
Edit To defrost thing car think actually going
If dehumidify air cycling warm humid air around window stay fogged warm past dew point air inside vehicle
If dehumidify air effectively lowering dew point air mean warm glass nearly much
This make quicker safely drive away clear window
I always found heat effective long term defogging window I live Florida
You constantly turn AC water start condensing outside
It fog back rather quickly inside turn AC
Once heat back tends stay clear
I saying turn knob
I saying lot vehicle setup turn knob defrost power compressor dehumidify heat blasting defrost
I know
I grew Toyotas I always AC button direct control whether puppy running
I broke made big difference fuel bill
It always annoyed American vehicle
I bought year ago like
No control AC
Annoying
Then I bought brand new lasy year guess
It AC button
Yay
Mmmmm really
It run time
When hit defrost auto automatically turn every time
Annoying
I basically given I make nice living I really worried fuel
I miss old Toyotas
I hate vent blowing face
I used leave Fresh Cold Feet Windshield AC would hit button got hot
Simple day man
The auto control like rich guy bumbling servant
You eventually roll eye let whatever
I leave auto close vent near
It could become practical calculation profit
For example putting Bitcoin mining ASICs radiator
Pretty sure going work bit coin
Its algorithm exponentially increasing difficulty
It constantly requires increasing amount gpu hardware
If want LOSE money mining bit coin start system
People mildly successful system take entire garage
They join group distributed computing worth I
The last thing I want I get home supporting web product play server
It hobby enjoy
Kinda like hunting
The amount meat I harvest cover quarter yearly cost
Overall I pay enjoyment
Thats Bitcoin
I get point though kind thing could eventually useful
It lack viable application
Well theory mining hardware speed hit diminishing return capital cost decreasing cost mostly energy point people make use waste heat profitable
But long way away
I looked
I looked solar house
ROI everything going perfect hardware never ever perfect
I know loss number apply ROI year really matter
I want PC generating little heat possible
Heat degrades system time well
It cool idea one many engineer flirted
What would better home designed like chemical plant many process linked via heat exchange
Just PC
Energy use always transformed heat unless exit window light little energy actually
Using electricity heat room heater device leave running heat expensive unfriendly environment
The form case course influence total heat produced computer special design useless purpose
It certainly possible
However I feel like currently practical
Basically replace
natural gas furnace heating natural electrical generator run generator whenever need heat waste heat generator heat source electricity produce byproduct either use sell electrical grid
This efficient way converting chemical potential energy useful energy way waste heat would often simply dumped environment power plant also count useful energy addition electricity produced
The generator unit also advantage efficiency drop external temperature cold
A heat pump decrease coefficient performance temperature cold side decrease relative temperature hot side practical device often minimum effective temperature operate effectively become resistance heater
If need lot heat could even use electricity produced generator drive heat pump
I think may one thermodynamically efficient way getting heat chemical potential energy
Edit If really want maximum thermodynamic efficiency good fuel cell better conversion efficiency heat engine
Radiators computer started happening year ago personal computer
Various type vaporized gas used cpu cooler well period time maybe little longer
As far sensibility really come environment use computer
In case I relatively dusty environment pet hair cigarette smoke also added
Traditional cpu cooler get gunked hair fuzz within month
Eventually completely disassemble entire computer blow air compressor component piece need cleaned dusted machine need elaborate process even simple computer
With radiator computer I suck hair inside radiator monthly vacuum
It much convenient use radiator reason
Yes I still take whole thing apart full cleaning per year
water cooling slightly better cooling significantly
Putting new paste cpu every month pain as traditional aluminum block fan setup Intel AMD ship aluminum cooler primary ingredient
Server part sometimes contain substitute without vaporized integrated cooler blower traditional fan
Last I would mention winter month house cold
My room cold thanks computer keeping busy work keep cpu load
I computer geek experimenting technology easy
However I used simple kit small radiator start
My system water cooler us radiator better heat dissipation performance
Each cooler gotten little better job say stock cooler new
It bit louder I use fan choice
When fan really crank time vacuum radiator clean Yeah overall slightly better job cooling I say radiator stay
removed Are drive inside
Does use substantial amount power
Does communicate large amount data reason
Your hypothesis seems rather bizarre
I also note I think Google computation data storage

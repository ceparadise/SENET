The difference BCIs neuroprosthetics mostly term used neuroprosthetics typically connect nervous system device whereas BCIs usually connect brain nervous system computer system
Practical neuroprosthetics linked part nervous example peripheral term BCI usually designates narrower class system interface central nervous system
The term sometimes however used interchangeably
Neuroprosthetics BCIs seek achieve aim restoring sight hearing movement ability communicate even
Both use similar experimental method surgical technique
Several laboratory managed record signal monkey rat operate BCIs produce movement

This would allow researcher monitor single neuron require le contact tissue reduce risk
In BCI study using patient ALS able restore basic ability patient communicate people
There also experiment human using technology interface
The substantial majority published BCI work involves noninvasive BCIs
Noninvasive technology interface used much broader variety application
Although interface easy wear require surgery relatively poor spatial resolution effectively use signal skull dampens signal dispersing blurring electromagnetic wave created neuron
interface also require time effort prior usage session whereas one well invasive one require training
Overall best BCI user depends numerous factor
In recent article entirely new communication device interface developed requiring ability move eye based covert
without fixing eye chosen letter virtual keyboard letter background circle brightness different time transition letter selection based best fit one hand unintentional oscillation pattern hand brightness oscillation pattern
Accuracy additionally improved user mental rehearsing word synchrony brightness transition
EEG studied interface mainly due fine ease use portability low cost
The technology somewhat susceptible however
In early day BCI research another substantial barrier using EEG interface extensive training required user work technology
For example experiment beginning Niels Birbaumer trained severely paralysed people EEG extent signal could used binary signal control computer cursor
Birbaumer earlier trained prevent impending fit controlling low voltage wave
The experiment saw ten patient trained move computer cursor controlling brainwave
The process slow requiring hour patient write character cursor training often took many month
However slow cortical potential approach BCIs used several year since approach require little training faster accurate work greater proportion user
Another research parameter type measured
Birbaumer later research Jonathan Wolpaw focused developing technology would allow user choose brain signal found easiest operate BCI including rhythm
A parameter method feedback used shown study signal
Patterns wave generated involuntarily people see something recognize may allow BCIs decode category thought without training patient first
By contrast method described require learning control brainwave resulting brain activity detected
While EEG based interface pursued extensively number research lab recent advancement made team suggest potential EEG based interface accomplish task close invasive interface

A VEP electrical potential recorded subject presented type visual stimulus
There several type VEPs
SSVEPs use potential generated exciting using visual stimulus modulated certain frequency
SSVEP stimulus often formed alternating checkerboard pattern time simply use flashing image
The frequency phase reversal stimulus used clearly distinguished spectrum EEG make detection SSVEP stimulus relatively easy
SSVEP proved successful within many BCI system
This due several factor signal elicited measurable large population transient VEP blink movement electrocardiographic artefact affect frequency monitored
In addition SSVEP signal exceptionally robust topographic organization primary visual cortex broader area obtains afferent central fovial region visual field
SSVEP several problem however
As SSVEPs use flashing stimulus infer user intent user must gaze one flashing iterating symbol order interact system
It therefore likely symbol could become irritating uncomfortable use longer play session often last hour may ideal gameplay
Another type VEP used application
The potential positive peak EEG occurs roughly m appearance target stimulus stimulus user waiting seeking
The amplitude decrease target stimulus ignored stimulus grow thought related higher level attention process orienting response Using control scheme advantage participant attend limited training session
The first application use model matrix
Within system subject would choose letter grid letter number
The row column grid flashed sequentially every time selected choice letter illuminated user potentially elicited
However communication process approximately character per minute quite slow
The BCI offer discrete selection rather continuous control mechanism
The advantage use within game player teach use completely new control system undertake short training instance learn gameplay mechanic basic use BCI paradigm

That person diagnosed DOC may fact able process information make important life decision whether seek therapy live view decision regarding
Some person diagnosed DOC die result decision may made family member sincerely feel patient best interest
Given new prospect allowing patient provide view decision would seem strong ethical pressure develop research direction guarantee DOC patient given opportunity decide whether want live

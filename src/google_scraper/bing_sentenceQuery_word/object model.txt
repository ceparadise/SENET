In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

The thinking behind development driven business thinking All developer coder selected direct university college none existing commercial development practice
This started late time many expecting removal coder articulated Naomi Bloom model become application without code written even generated
The founder international banker shared view perspective user information
He business executive understood enough impose business idea finding solution
The core thinking based upon entry data flow horizontal manner opposed vertical silo addressing business requirement yet remove need use coder build working application
It established people work need supported task type simple reality opened door removing need program code application
The early research carried using do operating system Paradox database create complete data centric environment utilising latent power relational database
Against current thinking proven identified generic task type required link could stored data database ready configured
By concept proven decided using Windows Oracle database chosen
Once new version created decided create Graphical Process Designer interface code would allow easy click drag open task type allow configuration business analyst build required What follows explains detail core thinking build take place
Before sustainable approach adopted important understand basic fundamental organisation actually work
First people source creator information second need recognise people work relatively small team achieve individual collective outcome make business indeed efficient government
Worthy note book keeping record history generally keep accountant happy business
The key issue established early business logic never changed since commerce started indeed business actually quite focus supporting people work
This includes simple complex
mean testing reflects business logic
The communication technology deliver complex challenging change fundamental business people internal external organisation IT support contribute efficiency
When look people work irrespective required function relatively work task type human system including user interface address business driven issue
So repeatedly recode every function business standardisation allows unlimited flexibility build business requirement With basic fundamental recognising latent power relational database technology different parameter deliver working application work started identifying task type follows

In short refers virtual version object machine system real world
Computer model designed act like system
A computer model used test system thus saving cost build sample system real life testing
They also help make prediction system important development maintenance
The model also useful training people try real system machine

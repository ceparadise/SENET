Planning algorithm widely used logistics control
They help schedule flight bus route guide autonomous robot determine control policy power grid among thing
In recent year planning algorithm begun factor uncertainty variation travel time erratic communication autonomous robot imperfect sensor data like
That cause scale planning problem grow exponentially researcher found solve efficiently
Now researcher MIT Australian National University ANU made problem even complex developing planning algorithm also generates contingency plan initial plan prove risky
It also identifies condition say sensor reading delay incurred trigger switch particular contingency plan
Despite extra labor imposed generating contingency plan algorithm still provides mathematical guarantee plan risk failure fall threshold user set
The problem planning contingency many thing go wrong generated plan possible contingency go nut say Brian Williams professor aeronautics astronautics whose group developed new system
So question end How many contingency generate Pedro Santana graduate student aeronautics astronautics first author paper describing system presented annual meeting Association Advancement Artificial Intelligence last weekend
He joined Williams Sylvie Thiébaux professor computer science Australian National University researcher Australia National Information Communications Technology Australia NICTA research program partnership MIT
As Williams explains range possible decision planner face represented data structure called
A graph consists node usually represented circle edge represented line segment connecting node
Network diagram flow chart familiar example graph
In planning system node graph represents decision point Should I take bus subway A path graph evaluated according reward offer reach destination safely penalty imposes five minute late
The optimal plan one maximizes reward
Factoring probability make type reward calculation much complex The average bus trip might minute chance average subway trip might minute almost never
In context even relatively simple planning task canvassing contingency plan prohibitively time consuming
To make problem tractable MIT ANU researcher borrowed technique Williams group
Before planner begin constructing graph asks user set risk threshold
A researcher trying develop plan example might satisfied percent probability robot take sensor reading supposed might want percent probability robot collide rock face high speed
The researcher algorithm treat threshold risk budget spends explores path graph
If planner determines given branch graph exceed budget lops
That determination rapid however
So researcher use simple rule thumb computer parlance heuristic evaluate branch
Every path given branch instance might include different car route two point probability distribution possible travel time
But traversing straight line point maximum allowed speed still incur intolerable delay point evaluating probability every route
The branch eliminated
As long heuristic optimistic possibly underestimating risk never overestimating planner lop branch without compromising quality final plan
Sometimes heuristic like one evaluates route geometrically
But sometimes
For instance one reason probability distribution add much complexity planning calculation nonlinear Their graph take shape complicated simple line
In paper presented International Conference Automated Planning Scheduling June Santana first author Williams colleague MIT University São Paulo Brazil Caltech describe way produce linear approximation probability distribution much easier work mathematically
Those approximation optimistic They never overestimate risk
But computer evaluate thousand time faster nonlinear distribution
Such heuristic offer hope researcher planning system could update plan fly light new information well generating contingency plan advance

A plan devised outcome usual expected plan
It often used exceptional risk though unlikely would catastrophic consequence
Contingency plan often devised
For example suppose many employee company traveling together aircraft crash killing aboard
The company could severely strained even ruined loss
Accordingly many company procedure follow event disaster
The plan may also include standing policy mitigate disaster potential impact requiring employee travel separately limiting number employee one aircraft
During time crisis contingency plan often developed explore prepare eventuality
During many government made contingency plan protect citizen
Examples contingency plan designed inform citizen survive nuclear attack booklet issued British American government
Today still contingency plan place deal catastrophe
The published contingency planning guide information technology system

The view simplicity virtue scientific theory thing equal simpler theory preferred complex one widely advocated history science philosophy remains widely held modern scientist philosopher science
It often go name Ockham The claim simplicity ought one key criterion evaluating choosing rival theory alongside criterion consistency data coherence accepted background theory
Simplicity sense often understood term simple theory represents nature example theory might said simpler another posit existence fewer entity cause process nature order account empirical data
However simplicity also understood term various feature theory go example theory might said simpler another contains fewer adjustable parameter invokes fewer extraneous assumption provides unified explanation data
Preferences simpler theory widely thought played central role many important episode history science
Simplicity consideration also regarded integral many standard method scientist use inferring hypothesis empirical data common illustration practice
Indeed philosopher argued systematic bias towards simpler theory hypothesis fundamental component inductive reasoning quite generally
However though legitimacy choosing rival scientific theory ground simplicity frequently taken granted viewed practice raise number difficult philosophical problem
A common concern notion simplicity appear vague judgment relative simplicity particular theory appear irredeemably subjective
Thus one problem explain precisely theory simpler others relative simplicity theory objectively measured
In addition even get clearer simplicity measured remains problem explaining justification provided choosing rival scientific theory ground simplicity
For instance reason thinking simpler theory likely true
This article provides overview debate simplicity philosophy science
Section illustrates putative role simplicity consideration scientific methodology outlining common view scientist issue different formulation Ockham Razor commonly cited example simplicity work history current practice science
Section highlight wider significance philosophical issue surrounding simplicity central controversy philosophy science epistemology
Section outline challenge facing project trying precisely define measure theoretical simplicity survey leading measure simplicity complexity currently market
Finally Section survey wide variety attempt made justify practice choosing rival theory ground simplicity
There many way simplicity might regarded desirable feature scientific theory
Simpler theory frequently said beautiful elegant rival might also easier understand work
However according many scientist philosopher simplicity something merely hoped theory something strive already selected theory believe right track example trying find simpler formulation accepted theory
Rather claim simplicity actually one key criterion use evaluate set rival theory fact best theory given available evidence thing equal simplest theory consistent data best one
This view long illustrious history
Though commonly associated century philosopher also spelt Occam whose name attached famous methodological maxim known Ockham razor often interpreted enjoining u prefer simplest theory consistent available evidence traced least far back
In Aristotle argued nothing nature done vain nothing superfluous theory nature simple possible
Several century later beginning modern scientific revolution Galileo espoused similar view holding n ature multiply thing unnecessarily make use easiest simplest mean producing effect Galilei
Similarly beginning third book Isaac Newton included following principle among rule study natural philosophy In century Albert Einstein asserted experience hitherto justifies u believing nature realisation simplest conceivable mathematical idea Einstein
More recently eminent physicist Steven Weinberg claimed fellow physicist demand simplicity rigidity principle willing take seriously Weinberg Nobel prize winning economist John Harsanyi stated ther thing equal simpler theory preferable le simple theory quoted McAlleer
It noted however scientist agree simplicity regarded legitimate criterion theory choice
The eminent biologist Francis Crick complained w hile Occam razor useful tool physic dangerous implement biology
It thus rash use simplicity elegance guide biological research Crick
Similarly group earth scientist writing Hence many scientist assert rival theory evaluated ground simplicity others much skeptical idea
Much skepticism stem suspicion cogency simplicity criterion depends assuming nature simple hardly surprising given way many scientist defended criterion good reason make assumption
Crick instance seemed think assumption could make sense biology given patent complexity biological world
In contrast advocate simplicity argued preference simple theory need necessarily assume simple instance even nature demonstrably complex ontological sense still prefer comparatively simple nature complexity
Oreskes others also emphasize simplicity principle scientist Galileo Newton explicitly rooted particular kind natural theology held simple elegant universe necessary consequence God benevolence
Today much le enthusiasm grounding scientific method theology putative connection God benevolence simplicity creation theologically controversial case
Another common source skepticism apparent vagueness notion simplicity suspicion scientist judgment relative simplicity theory lack principled objective basis
Even doubting popularity idea simplicity used criterion theory choice evaluation
It seems explicitly ingrained many scientific instance standard statistical method data analysis Section
It also spread far beyond philosophy natural science
A recent issue instance contained advice u nfortunately many people perceive criminal act complex really least complicated explanation event usually correct one Rothwell
Many scientist philosopher endorse methodological principle known Ockham Razor
This principle formulated variety different way
In early century typically equated general maxim simpler theory better complex one thing equal
Historically however common formulate Ockham Razor specific type simplicity principle often referred principle parsimony
Whether William Ockham would endorsed wide variety methodological maxim attributed matter controversy see Thorburn entry William Ockham since Ockham never explicitly referred methodological principle called razor
However standard formulation principle seems reasonably close sort principle Ockham probably would maxim entity multiplied beyond necessity
So stated principle since concerned parsimony respect theory posit existence attempting account empirical data
Entity context typically understood broadly referring object example atom particle also kind natural phenomenon theory may include ontology cause process property forth
Other general formulation Ockham Razor exclusively ontological may also make reference various structural feature theory go explaining nature unity explanation
The remainder section focus traditional ontological interpretation
It important recognize principle entity multiplied beyond necessity read least two different way
One way reading call Barnes
This principle call elimination ontological posit theory
Suppose instance two theory seek explain set empirical data Suppose also identical term entity posited except fact entail additional posit part
So let u say posit posit
Intuitively complex theory posit thing
Now let u assume theory provide equally complete explanation D sense feature D two theory account
In situation principle would instruct u prefer simpler theory complex theory
The reason contains explanatorily redundant posit explanatory work theory respect We know posit alone provides equally adequate account D
Hence infer positing alone sufficient acquire explanatory ability offered respect D adding nothing improve ability account data
This sort principle underlies one important interpretation entity multiplied beyond necessity principle invite u get rid superfluous component theory
Here ontological posit superfluous respect given theory T far nothing improve T ability account phenomenon explained
This understood Ockham razor Mill
Mill also pointed plausible principle explanatorily redundant effect ability theory explain also posit obtain evidential support data
This plausible theoretical entity evidentially supported empirical data extent help u account data take form
If theoretical entity fails contribute end data fails confirm existence entity
If independent reason postulate existence entity justification including entity theoretical ontology
Another justification offered principle probabilistic one
Note theory say exist say exists
It consequence axiom probability logically stronger theory always le probable logically weaker theory thus long probability existing probability existing independent probability existing greater zero probability existing le assert Pr exists Pr exists exists Pr exists Pr exists Pr exists
According reasoning therefore regard claim priori probable claim reason prefer
However one objection probabilistic justification principle fully explain dislike theory posit explanatorily redundant entity really logically stronger theory rather postulate entity
When principle parsimony read principle seems relatively uncontroversial
However important recognize vast majority instance principle parsimony applied seen applying science given interpretation merely term principle
This phrase entity multiplied beyond necessity normally read call theory posit fewer thing thing equal preferred theory posit thing relevant posit play genuine explanatory role theory concerned Barnes
This much stronger claim claim razor explanatorily redundant entity
The evidential justification principle described used motivate principle since reasoning behind justification allows posit many thing like long individual posit explanatory work within theory
It merely tell u get rid theoretical ontology perspective given theory explanatorily redundant
It tell u theory posit fewer thing accounting data better theory posit sparser ontology better richer one
Another important point principle give u reason assert superfluous posit
Absence evidence evidence
Hence version Ockham razor sometimes also referred agnostic razor rather atheistic razor since motivates u ontology Sober
It seems case Ockham razor appealed science intended support atheistic entity concerned merely cut theoretical ontology existence also denied
Hence explain preference justified need look different justification
With respect probabilistic justification principle described important note axiom probability Pr exists exist Pr exists
It widely believed numerous episode history science particular scientific theory defended particular scientist came preferred wider scientific community le directly empirical reason example telling experimental finding result relative simplicity compared rival theory
Hence history science taken demonstrate importance simplicity consideration scientist defend evaluate choose theory
One striking example Isaac Newton argument universal gravitation
At beginning third book subtitled The system world Isaac Newton described four rule study natural philosophy Here see Newton explicitly placing simplicity heart conception scientific method
Rule version Ockham Razor despite use word superfluous typically read principle rather principle see Section taken follow directly assumption nature simple turn taken give rise rule principle inductive generalization infer similar cause similar effect assume universal body property found observed body
These rule play crucial role follows centrepiece argument
After laying rule method Newton described several phenomenon fact empirical generalization derived astronomical observation motion planet satellite including moon
From phenomenon rule method deduced several general theoretical proposition
Propositions state satellite Jupiter primary planet moon attracted towards center Jupiter sun earth respectively force keep orbit stopping following linear path direction motion one time
These force also claimed vary inversely square distance orbiting body example Mars center body orbit example sun
These proposition taken follow phenomenon including fact respective orbit shown approximately obey Kepler law area harmonic law law motion developed book
Newton asserted proposition The moon gravitates toward earth force always drawn back rectilinear motion kept orbit
In word force gravity keep moon orbit around earth
Newton explicitly invoked rule argument proposition become known
First astronomical observation told u fast moon accelerates towards earth
Newton able calculate acceleration moon would earth surface fall earth
This turned equal acceleration body observed fall experiment conducted earth
Since force gravity cause body earth fall Newton assumed reader familiarity gravity sense since gravity force acting moon directed towards center earth similar equal Newton asserted rule cause
Therefore force act falling body earth keep moon orbit one gravity
Given force gravity acting terrestrial body could claimed obey law
Through similar deployment rule Newton led claim also gravity keep planet orbit around sun satellite Jupiter Saturn orbit since force also directed toward center sun Jupiter Saturn display similar property force gravity earth fact obey law
Therefore force gravity held act planet universally
Through several step Newton eventually able get principle universal gravitation gravity mutually attractive force act two body whatsoever described law say body attracts force equal magnitude proportional product mass two body inversely proportional squared distance
From Newton able determine mass density sun Jupiter Saturn earth offer new explanation tide sea thus showing remarkable explanatory power new physic
Newton argument subject much debate amongst historian philosopher science discussion various controversy surrounding structure accuracy premise see Glymour Cohen Harper
However one thing seems clear conclusion mean forced u simple deduction phenomenon even combined mathematical theorem general theory motion outlined book
No experiment mathematical derivation phenomenon demonstrated must gravity common cause falling body earth orbit moon planet satellite much le gravity mutually attractive force acting body whatsoever
Rather Newton argument appears boil claim gravity property accorded principle universal gravitation provide common causal explanation phenomenon rule method tell u infer common cause wherever
Hence rule turn grounded preference simplicity play crucial role taking u phenomenon universal gravitation discussion apparent link simplicity common cause reasoning see Sober
Newton argument universal gravitation thus seen argument putatively simplest explanation empirical observation
Numerous putative example simplicity consideration work history science cited literature Though commonplace scientist philosopher claim simplicity consideration played significant role history science important note skeptic argued actual historical importance simplicity consideration example Bunge Lakatos Zahar
Such skeptic dispute claim explain basis episode theory change according role simplicity claiming consideration actually carried weight
In addition argued many case appear surface appeal relative simplicity theory fact covert appeal theoretical virtue example Boyd Sober Norton Fitzpatrick
Hence putative example simplicity work history science important consider whether relevant argument best reconstructed term deflationary view simplicity discussed Section
Many philosopher come see simplicity consideration figuring scientist go evaluating choosing developed scientific theory also mechanic making much basic inductive inference empirical data
The standard illustration modern literature practice
Suppose series observation value variable given value another variable
This give u series data point represented Figure
Given data underlying relationship posit predict future pair value
Standard practice select bumpy curve neatly pass data point rather select smooth straight line pass close data
But
Part answer come fact data degree contaminated measurement error example mistake data collection noise produced effect uncontrolled factor curve fit data perfectly likely false
However explain preference curve like infinite number also pas close data
It simplicity seen playing vital though often implicit role go inferring hypothesis empirical data posit simpler relationship reason simplicity tend infer hypothesis like
The practice taken show aware being fundamental cognitive bias towards simple hypothesis
Whether deciding rival scientific theory performing basic generalization experience ubiquitously tend infer simplest hypothesis consistent observation
Moreover bias held necessary order u able select unique hypothesis potentially limitless number hypothesis consistent finite amount experience
The view simplicity may often play implicit role empirical reasoning arguably traced back description enumerative induction context formulation famous
Hume suggested tacit assumption ingrained psychology
Thus naturally drawn conclusion raven black feather fact previously observed raven black feather tacitly assume world broadly uniform property
This seen kind simplicity assumption simpler assume
A fundamental link simplicity inductive reasoning retained many recent descriptive account inductive inference
For instance described induction application called Straight Rule modelling inductive inference
In addition proponent model Inference Best Explanation hold many inductive inference best understood inference hypothesis would true provide observation normally claim simplicity one criterion use determine hypothesis constitutes best explanation
In recent year putative role simplicity inferential psychology attracting increasing attention cognitive scientist
For instance Lombrozo describes experiment claim show participant use relative simplicity rival explanation instance whether particular medical diagnosis set symptom involves assuming presence one multiple independent condition guide assessing probability disproportionate amount contrary probabilistic evidence required participant choose complex explanation simpler one
Simplicity consideration also seen central learning process many different cognitive domain including language acquisition category learning example Chater Lu others
Philosophers long used example illustrate often implicit role played consideration simplicity inductive reasoning empirical data
However partly due advent computing power fact scientist many discipline find deal ever larger intricate body data recent decade seen remarkable revolution method available scientist analyzing interpreting empirical data Gauch
Importantly numerous formalized procedure data analysis implemented computer widely used discipline engineering crop science contain explicit role notion simplicity
The literature method abounds talk Ockham Razor Occam factor Ockham hill MacKay Gauch Occam window Raftery others forth
This literature provides important illustration role simplicity play scientific practice may also offer insight philosopher seeking understand basis role
As illustration consider standard procedure Akaike Information Criterion AIC Bayesian Information Criterion BIC Minimum Message Length MML Minimum Description Length MDL procedure numerous others discussion see Forster Sober Forster Gauch Dowe others
Model selection matter selecting relationship posited set variable given sample data effort generate hypothesis true underlying relationship holding population inference make prediction future data
This question arises simple example discussed instance whether true underlying relationship linear parabolic quadratic
It also arises lot context problem inferring causal relationship exists empirical effect set variable
Models sense family function family linear function LIN family parabolic function PAR
The simplicity model normally explicated term number adjustable parameter contains MML MDL measure simplicity model term extent provide compact description data produce similar result counting adjustable parameter
On measure model LIN simpler PAR since LIN contains two adjustable parameter whereas PAR three
A consequence complex model always able fit given sample data better simpler model fitting model data involves using data determine value parameter model given identifying member family
For instance returning scenario represented Figure curve PAR guaranteed fit data set least well member simpler model LIN true matter data since linear function special case parabola curve member LIN also member PAR
Model selection procedure produce ranking model consideration light data thus allowing scientist choose
Though different way AIC BIC MML MDL implement procedure model selection impose penalty complexity model complex model fit data sample hand significantly better simpler one rated higher simpler model
Often penalty greater smaller sample data
contrary assumption seems suggest simplicity consideration come play tiebreaker theory fit data equally well according model selection literature simplicity sometimes better fit data
Hence simplicity need come play thing equal
Both statistician philosopher statistic vigorously debated underlying justification sort model selection procedure see example paper Zellner others
However one motivation taking account simplicity model derives piece practical wisdom error noise data sample relatively simple model fit sample le well often accurate come predicting example future data complex model fit sample closely
The logic since complex model flexible ability fit data since adjustable parameter also greater propensity misled error noise case may recover le true underlying signal sample
Thus constraining model complexity may facilitate greater predictive accuracy
This idea captured Gauch following MacKay call Ockham hill
To left peak hill increasing complexity model improves accuracy respect data recovers signal sample
However peak increasing complexity actually diminishes predictive accuracy lead spurious noise sample
There therefore optimal peak Ockham hill simplicity fit sample data come facilitating accurate prediction data
Indeed essentially core idea behind AIC development initiated enormous literature model selection philosopher Malcolm Forster Elliott Sober sought use reasoning make sense role simplicity many area science see Section
One important implication apparent link model simplicity predictive accuracy interpreting sample data using relatively simple model may improve efficiency experiment allowing scientist le example scientist may able run costly experiment fewer time position make relatively accurate prediction future
Gauch describes several real world case crop science elsewhere gain accuracy efficiency use relatively simple model documented
The putative role simplicity evaluation rival scientific theory mechanic go inferring hypothesis empirical data clearly raise number difficult philosophical issue
These include mean limited question precisely say one theory hypothesis simpler another relative simplicity theory question rational provided choosing rival theory ground simplicity closely related question simplicity consideration ought carry theory choice relative theoretical virtue particularly sometimes
For general survey philosophical literature issue see Hesse Sober
Before delve deeply philosopher sought answer question worth noting close connection philosophical issue surrounding simplicity many important controversy philosophy science epistemology
First problem simplicity close connection issue surrounding nature justification inductive inference
Some philosopher actually offered idea simpler theory preferable le simple one purported problem induction relative simplicity hypothesis tend infer empirical observation supposedly provides justification simplicity provides warrant inductive practice
This approach popular since taken merely substitute problem induction equally substantive problem justifying preference simpler theory
A common view recent literature problem induction problem justifying preference simpler theory closely connected may even amount problem
Hence solution latter problem provide substantial help towards solving former
More generally ability make sense putative role simplicity scientific reasoning seen many central desideratum adequate philosophical theory scientific method
For example Thomas Kuhn influential discussion importance scientist aesthetic limited judgment scientific revolution central part case adopting richer conception scientific method theory change science found dominant logical empiricist view time
More recently critic Bayesian approach scientific reasoning theory confirmation hold sound inductive reasoning reasoning according formal principle probability claimed simplicity important feature scientific reasoning escape Bayesian analysis
For instance Forster Sober argue Bayesian approach model selection Bayesian Information Criterion given Bayesian rationale approach build bias towards simpler model
The ability Bayesian approach make sense simplicity model selection aspect scientific practice thus seen central evaluating promise see example Glymour Forster Sober Forster Kelly Glymour Howson Urbach Dowe others
Discussions legitimacy simplicity criterion theory choice also closely bound debate scientific realism
Scientific realist assert scientific theory aim offer literally true description world good reason believe claim current best scientific theory least approximately true including claim purport unobservable natural phenomenon beyond direct perceptual access
Some object possible formulate incompatible alternative current best theory consistent current data perhaps even future data could ever collect
They claim therefore never justified asserting claim current best theory especially concerning unobservables true approximately true
A standard realist response emphasize role theoretical virtue theory choice among simplicity normally listed
The claim thus rule alternative theory unnecessarily complex
Importantly defense work realist defend idea justified choosing rival theory ground simplicity also simplicity used guide
Naturally particularly empiricist persuasion example van Fraassen expressed deep skepticism alleged simplicity criterion
The first major philosophical problem seems arise notion simplicity play role theory choice evaluation concern specifying detail mean say one theory simpler another relative simplicity theory precisely objectively measured
Numerous attempt made formulate definition measure theoretical simplicity face significant challenge
Philosophers one contribute endeavour
For instance last decade number formal measure simplicity complexity developed mathematical information theory
This section provides overview main simplicity measure proposed problem face
The proposal described also normally tied particular proposal justifies preference simpler theory
However discussion justification left Section
To begin worth considering providing precise definition measure theoretical simplicity ought regarded substantial philosophical problem
After often seems one confronted set rival theory designed explain particular empirical phenomenon obvious simplest
One always need precise definition measure particular property able tell whether something exhibit greater degree something else
Hence could suggested philosophical problem minor interest certainly little relevance scientific practice
There however reason regard substantial philosophical problem also practical relevance
First always easy tell whether one theory really ought regarded simpler another uncommon practicing scientist disagree relative simplicity rival theory
A historical example disagreement Galileo Kepler concerning relative simplicity Copernicus theory planetary motion according planet move perfect circular orbit epicycle Kepler theory according planet move elliptical orbit see Holton McAllister
Galileo held idea perfect circular motion simpler elliptical motion
In contrast Kepler emphasized elliptical model planetary motion required many fewer orbit circular model enabled reduction planetary motion three fundamental law planetary motion
The problem scientist seem evaluate simplicity theory along number different dimension may conflict
Hence deal fact theory may regarded simpler rival one respect complex another
To illustrate consider following list commonly cited way theory may held simpler others As seen list considerable diversity
We see theoretical simplicity frequently thought term example quantitative qualitative parsimony also sometimes feature theory example unification paucity adjustable parameter intuitive type simplicity may often cluster together instance qualitative parsimony would seem often go together invoking common cause explanation would turn often seem go together explanatory also considerable scope pointing different direction particular case
For example theory qualitatively parsimonious result positing fewer different kind entity might quantitatively unparsimonious result positing particular kind entity demand explain term process rather process may conflict demand explain term common cause behind similar phenomenon
There also different possible way evaluating simplicity theory regard one intuitive type simplicity
A theory may instance come quantitatively parsimonious another one focus number independent entity posit le parsimonious one focus number independent cause invokes
Consequently seems simplicity criterion actually applicable practice need way resolving disagreement may arise scientist relative simplicity rival theory requires precise measure simplicity
Second already mentioned considerable amount skepticism expressed philosopher scientist practice choosing one theory another ground relative simplicity stemmed suspicion simplicity judgment lack principled basis example Ackerman Bunge Priest
Disagreements scientist along multiplicity scope conflict intuitive type simplicity important contributor suspicion leading view two theory way evaluating simplicity come simpler vice versa
It seems adequate defense legitimacy simplicity criterion need show fact principled way determining one theory indeed simpler another
Moreover far also justificatory issue dealt also need clear exactly need justify preference
One proposal simplicity theory precisely objectively measured term briefly expressed
For example natural way measuring simplicity equation count number term parameter contains
Similarly could measure simplicity theory term size example number write claim
Such measure simplicity often referred measure since involve counting linguistic element required state describe theory
A major problem facing syntactic measure simplicity problem
A measure simplicity language variant delivers different result depending language used represent theory compared
Suppose example measure simplicity equation counting number term contains
This produce result come simpler
However second equation simply transformation first Cartesian r x hence logically equivalent
The intuitive proposal measuring simplicity context according hypothesis said simpler contain fewer parameter also language variant sense
How many parameter hypothesis contains depends scale one us
For two function way transforming scale turn linear curve curve vice versa
Nelson Goodman famous new riddle induction allows u formulate another example problem language variance
Suppose previously observed emerald green
Now consider following hypothesis color property entire population emerald Intuitively seems simpler hypothesis
To begin stated smaller vocabulary
also seems postulate uniformity property emerald posit
For instance seems assume link time emerald first observed property
Thus viewed including additional time parameter
But consider Goodman invented predicate grue bleen
These defined variety different way let u define follows object grue first observed time object green first observed object blue object bleen first observed time object blue first observed time object green
With predicate define property grolor
Grue bleen grolors green blue color
Now way grolors defined color predicate like green blue also defined term grolor predicate object green first observed time object grue first observed time object bleen object blue first observed time object bleen first observed object grue
This mean statement expressed term green blue also expressed term grue bleen
So rewrite follows earlier judged simpler
However retain simplicity judgment say simpler stated smaller vocabulary say posit greater uniformity hence simpler contain time parameter
This simplicity judgment based syntactic feature reversed merely switching language used represent hypothesis color language grolor language
Examples taken show two thing
First syntactic measure simplicity suffice produce principled simplicity ordering since measure produce different result depending language representation used
It enough stipulate evaluate simplicity one language rather another since would explain simplicity measured way
In particular want know chosen language accurately tracking objective simplicity theory compared
Hence syntactic measure simplicity used say practical purpose must underwritten fundamental theory simplicity
Second plausible measure simplicity entirely neutral respect different claim world theory make interpreted making
Because respective definition color grolors hypothesis posit uniformity color property must posit grolor property
As Goodman emphasized one find uniformity anywhere restriction placed kind property taken account
Similarly say theory simpler posit existence fewer entity cause process since using manipulation trivial show theory regarded positing number different entity cause process
Hence principled restriction need placed aspect content theory taken account disregarded measuring relative simplicity
According Nelson Goodman important component problem measuring simplicity scientific theory problem measuring degree theory imposes world since Goodman seek simplicity seek system
In series paper Goodman attempted explicate precise measure theoretical systematization term logical property set concept term make statement theory
According Goodman scientific theory regarded set statement
These statement contain various term including property term relation term
These term assigned predicate symbol
Hence statement theory expressed first order language using standard symbolic notion
For instance acid may become A smaller may become S
Goodman claim measure simplicity system predicate employed theory term logical property arity reflexivity transitivity symmetry
The detail arehighly technical roughly Goodman proposal system predicate used express complex system predicate used express le
For instance one axiom Goodman proposal every set predicate relevant kind always replaceable set predicate another kind complex
Part Goodman project avoid problem language variance
Goodman measure linguistic measure since concern measuring simplicity theory predicate basis first order language
However purely syntactic measure since involve merely counting linguistic element number predicate
Rather regarded attempt measure conceptual scheme conceptual scheme used say complex conceptual scheme used say le
Hence theory regarded simpler requires le expressive system concept
Goodman developed axiomatic measure simplicity considerable detail
However Goodman ever regarded measure particular type simplicity since concern logical property predicate employed theory
It example take account number entity theory postulate
Moreover Goodman never showed measure could applied real scientific theory
It objected even Goodman measure could applied would discriminate many theory intuitively differ kind simplicity systematization Goodman want measure
For instance plausible system concept used express Copernican theory planetary motion expressively rich system concept used express Ptolemaic theory yet former widely regarded considerably simpler latter partly virtue providing intuitively systematic account data discussion detail Goodman proposal objection face see Kemeny Suppes Kyburg Hesse
It often argued simpler theory say world hence easier test complex one
example claimed simplest theory whose empirical consequence readily deduced compared observation eliminated easily wrong
Complex theory hand tend le precise allow wriggle room accommodating data
This apparent connection simplicity testability led philosopher attempt formulate measure simplicity term relative testability theory
famously proposed one testability measure simplicity
Popper associated simplicity empirical content simpler theory say world complex theory place restriction way world
According Popper empirical content theory hence simplicity measured term
The falsifiability theory concern ease theory proven false theory indeed false
Popper argued could measured term amount data one would need falsify theory
For example Popper measure hypothesis linearly related according equation form come greater empirical content hence greater simplicity hypothesis related according parabola form
This one need three data point falsify linear hypothesis one need least four data point falsify parabolic hypothesis
Thus Popper argued empirical content falsifiability hence simplicity could seen equivalent paucity adjustable parameter
John Kemeny proposed similar testability measure according theory complex come true way universe number individual universe contains
Popper equation simplicity falsifiability suffers serious objection
First applied comparison theory make equally precise claim comparison parabolic hypothesis specific linear hypothesis specify precise value parameter falsified one data point
It also applied compare theory make probabilistic claim world since probabilistic statement strictly falsifiable
This particularly troublesome come accounting role simplicity practice since one normally deal possibility error data
As result error distribution normally added hypothesis consideration understood conferring certain probability data rather deductive observational consequence
In addition philosopher science tend think falsifiability really intrinsic property theory rather feature scientist disposed behave towards theory
Even deterministic theory normally entail particular observational consequence unless conjoined particular auxiliary assumption usually leaving scientist option saving theory refutation tinkering auxiliary point famously emphasized Pierre Duhem
This make extremely difficult maintain simpler theory intrinsically falsifiable le simple one
Goodman also argued equating simplicity falsifiability lead consequence
The hypothesis All maple tree deciduous intuitively simpler hypothesis All maple tree whatsoever sassafras tree Eagleville deciduous yet according Goodman latter hypothesis clearly easiest falsify two
Kemeny measure inherits many objection
Both Popper Kemeny essentially tried link simplicity theory degree accommodate potential future data simpler theory le accommodating complex one
One interesting recent attempt make sense notion accommodation due Harman Kulkarni
Harman Kulkarni analyze accommodation term concept drawn statistical learning theory known VC dimension
The VC dimension hypothesis roughly understood measure richness class hypothesis drawn class richer harder find data inconsistent member class
Thus hypothesis drawn class fit possible set data infinite VC dimension
Though VC dimension share important similarity Popper measure important difference
Unlike Popper measure implies accommodation always equivalent number adjustable parameter
If count adjustable parameter sine curve form sin come relatively unaccommodating however curve infinite VC dimension
While Harman Kulkarni propose VC dimension taken general measure simplicity fact regard simplicity scientific context idea along line might perhaps hold future promise measure simplicity
Similar notion accommodation term dimension used explicate notion simplicity statistical model face fact number adjustable parameter model contains language variant discussion see Forster Sober
In early work simplicity Elliott Sober proposed simplicity theory measured term
According Sober theory informative requires le supplementary information u order u able use determine answer particular question interested
For instance hypothesis informative hence simpler respect question value This order find value one need determine value first hypothesis whereas second hypothesis one also need determine value
Similarly Sober proposal used capture intuition theory say given class thing uniform property simpler theory say class informative relative particular question property class
For instance hypothesis raven black informative hence simpler raven black respect question colour next observed raven This former hypothesis one need additional information order answer question whereas one supplement latter hypothesis considerable extra information order generate determinate answer
By relativizing notion theory question one interested Sober measure avoids problem Popper Kemeny proposal faced arbitrarily specific theory theory made string irrelevant conjunction claim turning simplest
Moreover according Sober proposal content theory must relevant answering question count towards theory simplicity
This give rise distinctive element Sober proposal different simplicity ordering theory produced depending question one asks
For instance want know relationship value given value informative hence simpler
Thus theory simple relative question complex relative others
Critics argued Sober measure produce number result
Firstly measure explain people tend judge equation complex equation like relative question value In case one need value work value
Similarly Sober measure fails deal Goodman cited idea simplicity equates testability since produce outcome difference simplicity maple tree whatsoever sassafras tree Eagleville deciduous maple tree deciduous relative question whether maple tree deciduous
The Sober measure also generated criticism prefer see simplicity property varies given theory compared question one happens asking
Paul Thagard proposed simplicity ought understood ratio number fact explained theory number auxiliary assumption theory requires
Thagard defines auxiliary assumption statement part original theory assumed order theory able explain one fact explained
Simplicity measured follows A value given maximally complex theory requires many auxiliary assumption fact explains maximally simple theory requires auxiliary assumption explain
Thus higher ratio fact explained auxiliary assumption simpler theory
The essence Thagard proposal want explain much making fewest assumption way world
By balancing paucity auxiliary assumption explanatory power prevents unfortunate consequence simplest theory turning anaemic
A significant difficulty facing Thargard proposal lie determining auxiliary assumption theory actually count
It could argued problem counting auxiliary assumption threatens become difficult original problem measuring simplicity
What theory must assume world explain evidence frequently extremely unclear even harder quantify
In addition auxiliary assumption bigger onerous others clear given equal weighting Thagard measure
Another objection Thagard proposal struggle make sense thing like ontological idea theory simpler posit fewer clear parsimony would make particular difference number auxiliary assumption required
In defense Thagard argued ontological parsimony actually le important practicing scientist often thought
Over last decade number formal measure simplicity complexity developed mathematical information theory
Though many measure designed addressing specific practical problem central idea behind claimed significance addressing philosophical problem measuring simplicity scientific theory
One prominent measure simplicity current literature formal measure quantitative information content see Li Vitányi
The Kolmogorov complexity object length bit shortest binary program output completely faithful description universal programming language Java LISP
This measure originally formulated measure randomness data string sequence number based insight data string compressed finding pattern exist
If pattern data string possible provide completely accurate description shorter string term number bit information used description using pattern mnemonic eliminates redundant information need encoded description
For instance data string ordered sequence every followed every given short description specifies pattern value first data point number data point
Any information redundant
Completely random data set however contain pattern redundancy hence compressible
It argued Kolmogorov complexity applied general measure simplicity scientific theory
Theories thought specifying pattern exist data set meant explain
As result also think theory compressing data
Accordingly theory T compress data lower value data using T greater simplicity
An important feature Kolmogorov complexity measured universal programming language shown difference code length shortest code length one universal programming language shortest code length another programming language constant depends language chosen rather
This thought provide handle problem language variance Kolmogorov complexity seen measure objective inherent information content additive constant
Due enthusiast gone far claim Kolmogorov complexity problem defining measuring simplicity
A number objection raised application Kolmogorov complexity
First finding problem algorithm exists compute
This claimed serious practical limitation measure
Another objection Kolmogorov complexity produce result
For instance theory make probabilistic rather deterministic prediction data must maximum Kolmogorov complexity
For example theory say sequence coin flip conforms probabilistic law Pr Heads said compress data since one use law reconstruct exact sequence head tail even though offer intuitively simple explanation observe
Other measure simplicity Minimum Message Length MML Minimum Description Length MDL measure avoid practical problem facing Kolmogorov complexity
Though important difference detail measure see Wallace Dowe adopt basic idea simplicity empirical hypothesis measured term extent provides compact encoding data
A general objection measure simplicity scientific theory generally aim specify pattern data
They also aim explain pattern relation theory go explaining pattern observation theory often thought simple complex
Hence argued mere data compression suffice explication simplicity relation scientific theory
A objection data compression approach theory viewed compressing data set large number different way many consider appropriate contribution simplicity
The problem raised Goodman new riddle induction seen problem deciding regularity measure example color regularity grolor regularity
Formal measure discriminate different pattern finding
Hence measure applied specify sort pattern regularity taken account
There general consensus philosophical literature project articulating precise general measure theoretical simplicity face significant challenge
Of course stopped practicing scientist utilizing notion simplicity work particular concept simplicity statistical model understood term paucity adjustable parameter model firmly entrenched several area science
Given one potential way responding difficulty philosopher others encountered light apparent multiplicity scope conflict intuitive explication raise question whether theoretical simplicity fact concept
Perhaps single notion simplicity employed scientist rather cluster different sometimes related also sometimes conflicting notion simplicity scientist find useful varying degree particular context
This might evidenced observation scientist simplicity judgment often involve making different notion simplicity
Kepler preference astronomical theory abandoned perfectly circular motion planet could offer unified explanation astronomical observation term three basic law theory retained perfect circular motion could offer similarly unified explanation seems clear example
As result thought sort direction philosopher argued actually single theoretical value rather cluster example Bunge
It also worth considering possibility cluster accorded greater weight others understood practice may vary greatly across different discipline field inquiry
Thus really matter come evaluating comparative simplicity theory might quite different biologist physicist instance perhaps matter particle physicist different matter astrophysicist
If fact unified concept simplicity work science might also indicate unitary justification choosing rival theory ground simplicity
One important suggestion possibility lead role simplicity science understood global perspective understood locally
How simplicity ought measured matter may peculiarly explanation
Due apparent centrality simplicity consideration scientific method link numerous important philosophical issue problem justifying preference simpler theory regarded major problem philosophy science
It also regarded one intractable
Though extremely wide variety justification debate correctly define measure simplicity important recent contribution origin scientific literature statistic information theory cognate met significant objection
There currently agreement amongst philosopher promising path take
There also skepticism circle whether adequate justification even possible
Broadly speaking justificatory proposal categorized three type account seek show simplicity indicator simpler theory general likely true somehow better confirmed empirical data complex rival account regard simplicity direct indicator truth seek highlight alternative methodological justification preferring simpler theory deflationary approach actually reject idea general justification preferring simpler theory seek analyze particular appeal simplicity science term le problematic theoretical virtue
Historically dominant view prefer simpler theory complex one based general metaphysical thesis simplicity nature
Since nature simple relative simplicity theory thus regarded direct evidence truth
Such view explicitly endorsed many great scientist past including Aristotle Copernicus Galileo Kepler Newton Maxwell Einstein
Naturally however question arises justifies thesis nature simple
Broadly speaking two different sort argument given thesis benevolent God must created simple elegant universe ii past record success relatively simple theory entitles u infer nature simple
The theological justification common amongst scientist philosopher early modern period
Einstein hand invoked justification claiming history physic justifies u believing nature realization simplest conceivable mathematical idea
Despite historical popularity influence view recent philosopher scientist extremely resistant idea justified believing nature simple
For start seems difficult formulate thesis nature simple either obviously false vague use
There would seem many claim live simple universe
Consider instance picture atomic nucleus physicist working early part twentieth century assumed matter made proton electron thing neutron neutrino weak strong nuclear force explained electromagnetism
Subsequent discovery arguably led much complex picture nature much complex theory developed account
In response could claimed though nature seems complex superficial respect fact deep underlying simplicity fundamental structure nature
It might also claimed respect nature appears complex necessary consequence underlying simplicity
But serf highlight vagueness claim nature exactly thesis amount kind evidence could
However thesis formulated would seem extremely difficult one adequately defend whether theological ground
An attempt give theological justification claim nature simple suffers inherent unattractiveness modern philosopher scientist want ground legitimacy scientific method theology
In case many theologian reject supposed link God benevolence simplicity creation
With respect justification even case history science demonstrates better average success simpler theory may still raise significant worry extent could give sufficient credence claim nature simple
First assumes empirical success taken reliable indicator truth least approximate truth hence nature really like
Though standard assumption many scientific claim success would miraculous theory concerned radically highly contentious one since many hold history science show theory even eminently successful theory typically turn radically false
Even one accept link success truth success date may still provide representative sample nature maybe looked problem amenable simple solution real underlying complexity nature escaped notice
We also question degree extrapolate putative connection simplicity truth one area nature nature whole
Moreover far simplicity consideration held fundamental inductive inference quite generally attempted justification risk charge circularity
There another way appealing past success order try justify link simplicity truth
Instead trying justify completely general claim simplicity nature proposal merely suggests infer correlation success particular simplicity characteristic particular field instance particular kind symmetry certain area theoretical physic
If success regarded indicator least approximate truth infer theory simpler relevant sense likely true field correlation success hold
Recent example sort proposal include McAllister Kuipers
In effort account aesthetic consideration science including simplicity Theo Kuipers claim scientist tend become attracted theory share particular aesthetic feature common successful theory previously exposed
In word explain particular aesthetic preference scientist term similar psychological effect known effect occurs individual take liking something repeated exposure
If given field inquiry theory especially successful exhibit particular type simplicity however understood thus theory repeatedly presented scientist working field training effect lead scientist attracted theory also exhibit type simplicity
This process used support aesthetic induction correlation simplicity relevant sense success
One make case type simplicity legitimately taken indicator least approximate truth
Even though sort proposal attempt show nature general simple many objection raised raised attempt justify metaphysical thesis appeal past success simple theory
Once problem justifying claim empirical success reliable guide approximate truth
Kuipers argument claim rest somewhat idiosyncratic account truth approximation
In addition order legitimately infer genuine correlation simplicity success one look successful theory one must look unsuccessful theory
Even successful theory domain relevant simplicity characteristic might still case majority theory characteristic would highly unsuccessful
Indeed one potentially modify successful theory infinite number way keeping relevant simplicity characteristic one might actually able guarantee majority possible theory characteristic would unsuccessful theory thus breaking correlation simplicity success
This could taken suggesting order carry weight argument success also need offer explanation simplicity contributes success
Moreover though effect well documented Kuipers provides direct empirical evidence scientist actually acquire aesthetic preference via kind process proposes
According standard variety Bayesianism evaluate scientific theory according probability conditional upon evidence probability
This probability Pr T E function three quantity Pr E T probability theory T confers evidence E referred Pr T T Pr E probability T held higher posterior probability rival theory A standard Bayesian proposal understanding role simplicity theory choice simplicity one key determinates Pr T thing equal simpler theory hypothesis held higher prior probability true complex one
Thus two rival theory confer equal near equal probability data differ relative simplicity thing equal simpler theory tend higher posterior probability
This idea Harold Jeffreys called simplicity postulate elaborated number different way philosopher statistician information theorist utilizing various measure simplicity example Carnap Jeffreys Solomonoff Li Vitányi
In response proposal Karl Popper argued case assigning simpler theory higher prior probability actually violates axiom probability
For instance Jeffreys proposed simplicity measured counting adjustable parameter
On measure claim planet move circular orbit simpler claim planet move elliptical orbit since equation ellipse contains additional adjustable parameter
However circle also viewed special case ellipsis additional parameter set zero
Hence claim planet move circular orbit also seen special case claim planet move elliptical orbit
If right former claim probable latter claim truth former truth latter probability respect entailment
In reply Popper argued prior probabilistic bias towards simpler theory seen applying comparison inconsistent theory relation entailment hold instance claim planet move circular orbit claim move elliptical orbit
The main objection Bayesian proposal simplicity determinate prior probability theory probability seems offer resource explaining simpler theory accorded higher prior probability
thought prior probability could assigned priori hypothesis stated formal language basis logical analysis structure language assumption possible state affair
However Carnap approach generally recognized unworkable
If higher prior probability assigned simpler theory basis purely logical mathematical consideration seems Bayesians must look outside Bayesian framework justify simplicity postulate
Some Bayesians taken alternative route claiming direct mathematical connection established simplicity theory value Pr E T see Rosencrantz Myrvold White
This proposal depends assumption simpler theory fewer adjustable parameter hence consistent narrower range potential data
Suppose collect set empirical data E explained two theory differ respect kind simplicity simple theory S complex theory S adjustable parameter ever entail E C adjustable parameter θ take range value
When θ set specific value entail E value θ C entail different incompatible observation
It argued S confers higher probability This C allows lot possible observation could made instead E different possible setting θ
Hence truth C would make recording observation le probable would truth Here likelihood C calculated average likelihood version C defined unique setting θ
Thus complexity theory term number adjustable parameter number version theory give low probability E increase overall value Pr E T go
An objection proposal Kelly u able show S higher posterior probability C result higher likelihood must assumed prior probability C significantly greater prior probability This substantive assumption make way simplicity defined argument
We view C coming variety different version picked different value given θ
If assume S C roughly equal prior probability must implication assume version C low prior probability compared S since prior probability version C would Pr C assuming theory say particular parameter setting probable others
This would effectively build strong prior bias favour S version Given version C could considered complex theory could given simpler restricted would require additional supporting argument
The objection thus proposal simply begs question resting prior probabilistic bias towards simpler theory
Another objection proposal suffers limitation applied comparison theory simpler theory derived complex one fixing certain parameter
At best represents small fraction case simplicity thought play role
In light perceived failure philosopher justify claim simpler theory likely true Richard Swinburne argued claim regarded priori principle
Swinburne argues criterion theory evaluation scientist use reliably lead make correct judgment theory likely true
Since Swinburne argues one simpler theory thing equal likely true accept simplicity indeed indicator probable truth
However Swinburne think connection simplicity truth established empirically think shown follow obvious priori principle
Hence choice regard fundamental priori principle justified anything fundamental
In response Swinburne argued hardly going convince scientist philosopher obvious simpler theory likely true
Famously Karl Popper rejected idea theory ever confirmed evidence ever entitled regard theory true probably true
Hence Popper think simplicity could legitimately regarded indicator truth
Rather argued simpler theory valued
Indeed Popper thought simplicity theory could measured term falsifiability since intuitively simpler theory greater empirical content placing restriction way world thus leading reduced ability accommodate future might discover
According Popper scientific progress consists attainment true theory elimination false one
Thus reason prefer falsifiable theory theory quickly eliminated fact false
Hence practice first considering simplest theory consistent data provides faster route scientific progress
Importantly Popper meant prefer simpler theory probability true since set data likely complex theory Popper sense able accommodate simpler theory
Popper equation simplicity falsifiability suffers objection pose significant problem justificatory proposal Section
Another significant problem taking degree falsifiability criterion theory choice seems lead absurd consequence since encourages u prefer absurdly specific scientific theory general content
For instance hypothesis emerald green today turn blue judged preferable emerald green easier falsify
It thus seems deeply implausible say selecting testing hypothesis first provides fastest route scientific progress
A number philosopher sought elucidate rationale preferring simpler theory complex one explanatory term example Friedman Sober Walsh Thagard Kitcher Baker
These proposal typically made back account scientific explanation explicate notion explanatoriness explanatory power term taken intimately bound notion simplicity
According unification account explanation theory explanatory show different phenomenon related certain systematizing theoretical principle theory held greater explanatory power rival systematizes phenomenon
For Michael Friedman instance explanatory power function number independent phenomenon need accept ultimate smaller number independent phenomenon regarded ultimate theory explanatory theory
Similarly Philip Kitcher explanatory power increased smaller number pattern argument schema needed deliver fact world accept
Thus account explanatory power seen structural relationship sparseness fewness hypothesis argument plenitude fact explained
There various attempt explicate notion simplicity term sort feature
A standard type argument used want theory true also explanatory
If truth goal would reason prefer genuine scientific theory collection random factual statement happen true
Hence explanation ultimate rather purely instrumental goal scientific inquiry
Thus justify preference simpler theory recognize fundamental link simplicity explanatoriness explanation key goal scientific inquiry alongside truth
There objection unification theory explanation though concern claim unification claim current proposal depend
However even accept unification theory explanation accept explanation ultimate goal scientific inquiry objected choice simple theory complex rival normally choice theory genuinely explanatory sense mere factual report
The complex theory normally seen unifying different phenomenon systematizing principle least degree
Hence justificatory question prefer theory explain data theory prefer theory greater explanatory power sens described theory comparatively le explanatory
It certainly coherent possibility truth may turn relatively disunified unsystematic
Given seems appropriate ask justified choosing theory unifying
Just saying explanation ultimate goal scientific inquiry seem enough
In last decade treatment simplicity explicit part statistical methodology become increasingly sophisticated
A consequence philosopher science started looking statistic literature illumination think philosophical problem surrounding simplicity
According Malcolm Forster Elliott Sober Forster Sober Forster Sober work statistician Hirotugu Akaike provides precise theoretical framework understanding justification role simplicity model selection
Standard approach effect fit sample data simplicity kind mathematical relationship posited hold simplicity postulated model underlying relationship typically measured term number adjustable parameter contains
This often mean instance linear hypothesis fit sample data le well may chosen parabolic hypothesis fit data better
According Forster Sober Akaike developed explanation rational favor simpler model specific circumstance
The proposal build practical wisdom particular amount error noise data sample complex model greater propensity spurious data sample thus lead le accurate prediction instance future data particularly dealing small sample size
Gauch call Ockham hill left peak hill increasing complexity model improves accuracy respect data peak increasing complexity actually diminishes predictive accuracy
There therefore optimal peak Ockham hill simplicity fit data sample come facilitating accurate prediction
According Forster Sober Akaike prove theorem show given standard statistical assumption estimate degree constraining model complexity fitting curve sample data lead accurate prediction data
Following Forster Sober presentation Akaike theorem stated follows predictive accuracy model respect data number data point sample measure goodness fit sample higher score closer fit data best fitting member number adjustable parameter contains
Akaike theorem claimed specify estimator predictive accuracy mean distribution estimate centered around true value proof detail assumption behind Akaike theorem see Sakamoto others
This give rise model selection procedure Akaike Information Criterion AIC say choose model highest estimated predictive accuracy given data hand
In practice AIC implies parabola fit data sample better straight line much better outweighs greater complexity straight line used making prediction
Importantly penalty imposed complexity le influence model selection larger sample data meaning simplicity matter predictive accuracy dealing smaller sample
Forster Sober argue Akaike theorem explains simplicity quantifiable positive effect predictive accuracy combating risk noisy data
Hence one interested generating accurate instance future clear rationale preferring simpler model
Forster Sober explicit proposal meant apply scientific context understood within model selection framework predictive accuracy central goal inquiry certain amount error noise data
Hence view Akaike work offering complete solution problem justifying preference simpler theory
However argued significant number scientific inference problem understood Akaikian perspective
Several objection raised Forster Sober philosophical use Akaike work
One objection measure simplicity employed AIC language invariant since number adjustable parameter model contains depends model described
However Forster Sober argue though practical purpose quantity normally spelt term number adjustable parameter fact accurately explicated term notion family function language invariant
Another objection AIC statistically consistent
Forster Sober reply charge rest confusion AIC meant estimate example erroneously assuming AIC meant estimator true value size simplest model contains true hypothesis rather estimator predictive accuracy particular model hand
Another worry consideration imply idealized false model often make accurate prediction realistic model justification merely warrant use simplicity criterion hypothesis acceptance hypothesis construed realistically rather predictive tool
For part Forster Sober quite happy accept instrumentalist construal role simplicity model selection context simplicity guide truth predictive accuracy
Finally variety objection concerning nature validity assumption behind Akaikie theorem whether AIC applicable important class model selection problem discussion see Kieseppä Forster Howson Urbach Dowe others Sober Kelly
An important recent proposal justify preference simpler theory come work interdisciplinary field known Schulte Kelly
It proposed even know whether world simple complex inferential rule biased towards simple hypothesis shown converge truth alternative inferential rule
According proposal inferential rule said converge truth efficiently relative possible convergent inferential rule minimizes maximum number retraction opinion might required inquirer using rule guide decision believe given data
Such procedure said converge truth fashion since require fewer change mind along way
The proposal even know whether truth simple complex scientific inference procedure biased towards simplicity shown priori optimally efficient sense converging truth direct stable way possible
To illustrate basic logic behind proposal consider following example Oliver Schulte
Suppose investigating existence hypothetical particle Ω
If Ω exist able detect appropriate measurement device
However yet detected
What attitude take towards existence Ω
Let u say Ockham Razor suggests deny Ω exists detected ever
Alternatively could assert Ω exist finite number attempt detect Ω proved unsuccessful say ten thousand case assert Ω exist could withhold judgment Ω either detected ten thousand unsuccessful attempt detect
Since assuming existent particle go undetected forever abiding three inferential rule enable u converge truth limit whether Ω exists
However Schulte argues Ockham Razor provides efficient route truth
This following Ockham Razor incurs maximum retraction opinion retracting assertion assertion existence Ω detected
In contrast alternative inferential rule incur maximum retraction since Ω could go undetected ten thousand time detected ten thousandth one time
Hence efficiency requires one adopt Ockham Razor presume Ω exist detected
Kevin Kelly developed argument considerable detail
Kelly argues suitable refinement extended extremely wide variety real world scientific inference problem
Importantly Kelly argued proposal simplicity seen purely consideration theory choice
While simplicity regarded direct indicator truth nonetheless reason think practice favoring simpler theory strategy since promotes speedy stable attainment true belief
Hence simplicity regarded genuinely consideration theory choice
One worry efficiency proposal concern general applicability result scientific context simplicity may play role
The argument Ockham razor described seems depend evidential asymmetry establishing Ω exists establishing Ω exist detection Ω sufficient establish existence Ω whereas repeated failure detection sufficient establish
The argument may work detection procedure relatively instance relatively unambiguous instrument reading count detection entity difficult detect directly mistake easily made existence well
Similarly current stumbling block argument used justification employment simplicity bias statistical inference hypothesis consideration deductive observational consequence
Kelly however optimistic extending argument statistical inference
Another objection concern nature justification provided
What argument seems show strategy favoring simplest theory consistent data may help one find truth fewer reversal along way
It establish simpler theory regarded way better complex rival
Hence doubt extent proposal actually make sense standard example simplicity preference work history current practice science guiding assumption seems simpler theory preferred merely strategic reason theory
Various philosopher sought defend broadly account simplicity
Such account depart justificatory account discussed far rejecting idea simplicity fact regarded theoretical virtue criterion theory choice right
Rather according deflationary account simplicity appears driving factor theory evaluation something else real work
Richard Boyd instance argued scientist simplicity judgment typically best understood covert judgement
When scientist claim one theory simpler another often another way saying theory provides plausible account data
For Boyd covert judgment theoretical plausibility driven scientist background theory
Hence relevant background theory real work motivating preference simpler theory simplicity theory per se
John Norton advocated similar view context material theory induction according inductive inference licensed universal inductive rule inference schema rather local factual assumption domain inquiry
Norton argues apparent use simplicity induction merely reflects material assumption nature domain investigated
For instance try fit curve data choose variable function believe appropriate physical reality trying get
Hence fact believe prevail domain prefer simple linear function quadratic one curve fit data sufficiently well
In different domain believe different fact prevail decision hypothesis simple complex likely different
Elliott Sober defended sort deflationary analysis various appeal simplicity parsimony evolutionary biology
For example Sober argues common claim group selection hypothesis le parsimonious hence taken le seriously explanation biological adaptation individual selection hypothesis rest substantive assumption comparative rarity condition required group selection occur
Hence appeal Ockham Razor context covert appeal local background knowledge
Other attempt offer deflationary analysis particular appeal simplicity science include Plutynski focus debate evolutionary biology Fitzpatrick focus appeal simplicity debate cognitive capacity primate
If deflationary analysis putative role simplicity particular scientific context turn plausible problem concerning measure simplicity offer general justification preferring simpler theory avoided since simplicity per se shown substantive work relevant inference
However many philosopher skeptical deflationary analysis possible many context simplicity consideration thought play important role
Kelly example argued simplicity typically come play background knowledge underdetermines theory choice
Sober seems advocate mixed view appeal simplicity science best understood deflationary term others better understood term Akaikian model selection theory
The putative role consideration simplicity history current practice science give rise number philosophical problem including problem precisely defining measuring theoretical simplicity problem justifying preference simpler theory
As survey literature simplicity philosophy science demonstrates problem turned surprisingly resistant resolution remains live debate amongst philosopher science deal
On hand disputing fact practicing scientist continue find useful appeal various notion simplicity work
Thus many way debate simplicity resembles debate philosophy science justification induction turn closely related problem justifying preference simpler theory
Though arguably skepticism within scientific community legitimacy choosing rival theory ground simplicity legitimacy inductive latter complete practicing case induction many scientist continue employ practice method utilize notion simplicity great scientific effect assuming appropriate solution philosophical problem practice give rise fact exist even though philosopher far failed articulate
However survey also shown statistician information learning theorist scientist making increasingly important contribution debate philosophical underpinning practice

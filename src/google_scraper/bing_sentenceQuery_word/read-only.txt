type used electronic device
Data stored ROM modified slowly difficulty mainly used store closely tied specific unlikely need frequent update
Strictly refers memory later MROM changed manufacture
Although discrete circuit altered principle ICs useless data bad requires update
That memory never changed disadvantage many application bug fixed new feature added
More recently come include memory normal operation still reprogrammed way
EPROM EEPROM erased usually done relatively slow speed may require special equipment achieve typically possible certain number time
The simplest type ROM old
joined manually map input onto arbitrary value output
With invention came
Mask ROM consists grid line address input bit line data output selectively joined together transistor switch represent arbitrary table regular physical layout predictable
In mask ROM data physically encoded circuit programmed fabrication
This lead number serious disadvantage Subsequent development addressed shortcoming
invented allowed user program content exactly physically altering structure application pulse
This addressed problem since company simply order large batch fresh PROM chip program desired content designer convenience
The invention essentially solved problem since EPROM unlike PROM repeatedly reset unprogrammed state exposure strong ultraviolet light
invented went long way solving problem since EEPROM programmed containing device provides mean receive program content external source example personal computer via
invented commercialized early form EEPROM make efficient use chip area erased reprogrammed thousand time without damage
All technology improved flexibility ROM significant large quantity mask ROM would remain economical choice many year
Decreasing cost reprogrammable device almost eliminated market mask ROM year
Rewriteable technology envisioned replacement mask ROM
The recent development also invented Toshiba
Its designer explicitly broke past practice stating plainly aim NAND Flash replace rather traditional use ROM form
As NAND partially achieved goal offering throughput comparable hard disk higher tolerance physical shock extreme miniaturization form tiny example much lower power consumption
Every may use form storage retains data power removed store initial program run computer powered otherwise begin execution process known often abbreviated booting
Likewise every computer need form mutable memory record change executes
Forms memory employed storage program early computer
Until computer every program manually wired machine could take day week
memory simpler implement since needed mechanism read stored value change thus could implemented crude electromechanical device see
With advent ROM mutable counterpart implemented array silicon chip however ROM memory cell could implemented using fewer transistor SRAM memory cell since latter need comprising transistor retain content ROM cell might consist absence logical presence logical one transistor connecting bit line word line
Consequently ROM could implemented lower RAM many year
Most stored interpreter ROM form storage drive costly
For example included RAM KB ROM contained BASIC interpreter operating system
Later home office computer often included magnetic disk drive larger amount RAM allowing load operating system disk RAM minimal hardware initialization core remaining ROM known computer
This arrangement allowed complex easily upgradeable operating system
In modern PCs ROM flash used store basic bootstrapping main processor well various needed internally control device system
Today many memory especially BIOS often replaced Flash memory see permit reprogramming need firmware upgrade arise
However simple mature keyboard communication controller integrated circuit main board example may employ mask ROM programmable
ROM flash prevalent
These everything etc
designed specific function based
With software usually tightly coupled hardware program change rarely needed device typically lack hard disk reason cost size power consumption
As product use Flash rather mask ROM many provide mean connecting PC update example digital audio player might updated support new
Some hobbyist taken advantage flexibility reprogram consumer product new purpose example project enabled user run player wireless router respectively
ROM also useful binary storage data make difficult replace may desirable order enhance
Since ROM least mask form modified really suitable storing data expected need modification life device
To end ROM used many computer store evaluation mathematical logical function example might order facilitate faster computation
This especially effective slow ROM cheap compared RAM
Notably early personal computer stored table bitmapped font character ROM
This usually meant text display could changed interactively
This case adapter available IBM PC XT
The use ROM store small amount data disappeared almost completely modern computer
However Flash ROM taken new role medium file
Classic chip integrated circuit physically encode data stored thus impossible change content fabrication
Other type memory permit degree modification By applying type reprogrammable ROMs may temporarily become memory
There type memory based IC technology including Although relative speed RAM ROM varied time large RAM chip read faster ROMs
For reason allow uniform access ROM content sometimes copied RAM first use subsequently read RAM
For type ROM electrically modified writing speed traditionally much slower reading speed may need unusually high voltage movement jumper plug apply signal special command code
Modern NAND Flash achieves highest write speed rewritable ROM technology speed high enabled increased investment consumer enterprise solid state drive flash memory product higher end mobile device
On technical level gain achieved increasing parallelism controller design storage use large DRAM cache implementation memory cell store one bit DLC TLC MLC
The latter approach failure prone largely mitigated overprovisioning inclusion spare capacity product visible drive controller increasingly sophisticated algorithm drive firmware
Because written forcing electron layer onto floating gate rewriteable ROMs withstand limited number write erase cycle insulation permanently damaged
In earliest EPROMs might occur write cycle modern Flash EEPROM endurance may exceed
The limited endurance well higher cost per bit mean storage unlikely completely supplant magnetic near future
The timespan ROM remains accurately readable limited write cycling
The data retention EPROM EAROM EEPROM Flash may limited charge leaking memory cell transistor
Leakage accelerated high temperature
Masked ROM PROM suffer effect data retention depends physical rather electrical permanence integrated circuit although fuse problem system
The content ROM chip extracted special hardware device relevant controlling software
This practice common main example reading content older video
Another example making backup ROMs older computer device archival purpose many case original chip PROMs thus risk exceeding usable data lifetime
The resultant memory dump file known abbreviated used produce duplicate ROMs example produce new cartridge digital file playing
The term originated console game distributed cartridge containing ROM chip achieved widespread usage still applied image newer game distributed optical medium
ROM image commercial game firmware etc
usually contain copyrighted software
The unauthorized copying distribution copyrighted software violation law many jurisdiction although duplication purpose may considered depending location
In case thriving community engaged distribution trading software purpose

I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I quite feel difference two model
The first one Turing machine basically Turing machine write protected input
See question example It said indeed recognizes regular language way copy input without rewriting somewhere
And Turing machine binary representation overwrite
This equivalent full power Turing machine explained paper But difference
We still copy string like due lack overwriting power
So weak write input strong overwrite everywhere
Why encode string one case
A TM tape alphabet act blank
The rewritten symbol erased written back
This restriction seems equivalent symbol rewritten finite number time
TM capability interpreting finite segment tape one symbol
Then rewritten
A little modulo counting interprets segment
Recall TM equivalent finite state machine queue basic datastructure
It read delete one side write
To see equivalent TM rotation trick done queue hold tape circular fashion move tape one direction
To move direction move way
This rotation trick also done tape TM need finite rewrite position
One need able rewrite tape Ax say xB A B symbol x string

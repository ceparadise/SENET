In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

Any disability disclosure dealt confidentially sensitively
Your application assessed solely academic merit
Giving u information adversely affect chance offered place come Oxford help u ensure everything place enable take full part university life
SpLDs particular seem disproportionately common among Computer Science student tutor likely familiar
Advice working fee status given Most applicant UK Channel Islands Isle Man EU category
You use code eligible assessment student support arrangement even think family income high receive support
In order eligible assessed University must apply financially assessed regional funding agency
As long give consent share household income information University application student finance automatically assessed tuition fee
You must apply Oxford Cambridge except special circumstance
The reason simple application university competitive work fixed quota need sure people offer place tend accept
If allowed people apply university result would chaos would lead le fair result everyone
Your choice visible u received offer picked firm insurance
Unless put information personal statement get mentioned reference
Use institution code select Oxford University course code chosen degree course see list UCAS Everyone applies course one code three four year option
You decide part way programme wish finish end third year continue fourth
You may also enter campus code college applying select code open application
The list code given Advice choosing college This section tell u qualification taken take
The rule include clearly set UCAS guide
You must include school college university attended since age even withdrew course
You must tell u result qualification awarded certificate even taking qualification hope improving result
You may think poor result make application look bad look much worse subsequently find hidden
Oxford University require disclose information A Level unit score
However provide AS module result grade mark within UCAS application material information considered tutor part overall record academic attainment date
These recorded result may used evidence suitability study Oxford although used mechanistic way shortlist candidate interview determine candidate receive offer
It therefore interest declare AS module mark grade demonstrate performing strongly
Where policy school college certificate AS module result school longer enters candidate module year stated UCAS reference
If statement assumed policy certificate AS qualification Year
If international student give full detail qualification including exam taken left school exam taken get higher education vocational exam qualification award including detail awarding body
Please refer guidance use part conditional offer
Please try give UK equivalent
If first language English The Personal Statement opportunity creative
You use tell u want spend three year studying chosen subject university give u thing talk interview
The list UCAS guide give good summary thing might want cover also provide Computer Scientists thought The University Oxford requires candidate submit reference part UCAS application essential function admission process
If candidate include UCAS reference application regarded incomplete given consideration
References written someone know academically
Most reference talk teacher tutor perspective
Even job IT firm still teacher write reference
This still case even knowledgable computing
UCAS provides write
Your referee must write reference English
Obviously need able understand reference wo penalised English reference prefect
You ca submit one reference one person quote people within reference submit
Most reference focus following information Referees try avoid using vague term like instead give u concrete example
UMSs A Level Uniform Mark Scales good way
It helpful teacher tell u best student seen last ten
How applicant compare student school
Information well pupil help u ass applicant potential thrive Computer Science degree need tell u
We trying get overall impression candidate
It especially helpful u result achieved examination past variance ability estimated grade especially AS grade agree estimate referee comment otherwise difficulty deciding much weight give estimate
Now sumitted UCAS form registered admission test time start thinking sitting Please contact Tutor Admissions chosen college directly wait informed one assigned made open application let know change academic profile occur UCAS application submitted
Examples change include additional exam grade change exam grade following change exam board
The information college would take account stage would change personal circumstance since UCAS application submitted
Please ask chosen college consider additional reference supporting material outside UCAS application

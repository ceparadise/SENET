For tolerance matter time space
Tolerance kind behaviour depends atmosphere
For example someone say mother fucker
It word sound
But word force react studied
Tolerance science human behaviour
I wanted understand notion ZERO TOLERANCE wanted break zero tolerence Tolerence degree
It varies person person
I subscribe concept zero tolerence

An also one unduly penalize user
It human equivalent design allows equipment continue functioning presence hardware fault mode electronics unit would employed something like failed
Use forcing function one technique design
An example lockout reverse moving car
This prevents error prevention error effective technique design
The practice known Japan introduced part
The next effective technique design mitigation limitation effect error made
An example checking confirmation function action could severe consequence made error deleting file although consequence inadvertent file deletion reduced day concept like introduced
Adding great mitigating factor circumstance become hindrance confirmation becomes mechanical may become detrimental example prompt asked every file batch delete one may tempted simply agree prompt even file deleted accidentally
Another example use spell checking search performed search engine
The spell checking minimises problem caused incorrect spelling highlighting error user also providing link search using correct spelling instead
Searches like commonly performed using combination calculation

property enables continue operating properly event failure one fault within component
If operating quality decrease decrease proportional severity failure compared naively designed system even small failure cause total breakdown
Fault tolerance particularly sought
The ability maintaining functionality portion system break referred
A enables system continue intended operation possibly reduced level rather failing completely part system
The term commonly used describe designed continue le fully operational perhaps reduction increase event partial failure
That system whole stopped due problem either
An example another field motor vehicle designed continue drivable one tire punctured structure able retain integrity presence damage due cause manufacturing flaw impact
Within scope system fault tolerance achieved anticipating exceptional condition building system cope general aiming system converges towards state
However consequence system failure catastrophic cost making sufficiently reliable high better solution may use form duplication
In case consequence system failure catastrophic system must able use reversion fall back safe mode
This similar recovery human action human present loop
A highly system might continue level performance even though one component failed
For example building backup electrical generator provide voltage wall outlet even grid power fails
A system designed whether function reduced level fails completely way protects people property data injury damage intrusion disclosure
In computer program might executing opposed uncontrolled crash order prevent data corruption experiencing error
A similar distinction made failing well
opposite strategy used weapon system designed kill injure target even part system damaged destroyed
A system designed experience used computing similar fail safe operates reduced level performance component failure
For example building may operate lighting reduced level elevator reduced speed grid power fails rather either trapping people dark completely continuing operate full power
In computing example graceful degradation insufficient network bandwidth available stream online video version might streamed place version
example computing web page available basic functional format older web browser enhanced version browser capable handling additional technology larger display available
In program considered designed continue operation despite error exception invalid input instead crashing completely
opposite robustness
continue transmit data despite failure link node likewise expected prevent complete failure situation like earthquake flood collision
A system high alert user component failure occurred even continues operate full performance failure repaired imminent complete failure anticipated
Likewise component designed report first point failure rather allow downstream component fail generate report
This allows easier diagnosis underlying problem may prevent improper operation broken state
Redundancy provision functional capability would unnecessary environment
This consist backup component automatically kick one component fail
For example large cargo truck lose tire without major consequence
They many tire one tire critical exception front tire used steer generally carry le load total four le likely fail
The idea incorporating redundancy order improve reliability system pioneered
Two kind redundancy possible space redundancy time redundancy
Space redundancy provides additional component function data item unnecessary operation
Space redundancy classified hardware software information redundancy depending type redundant resource added system
In time redundancy computation data transmission repeated result compared stored copy previous result
The current terminology kind testing referred Service Fault Tolerance Testing ISFTT short
Providing design every component normally option
Associated redundancy brings number penalty increase weight size power consumption cost well time design verify test
Therefore number choice examined determine component fault tolerant An example component pass test car occupant restraint system
While normally think occupant restraint system
If vehicle roll undergoes severe primary method occupant restraint may fail
Restraining occupant accident absolutely critical safety pas first test
Accidents causing occupant ejection quite common pas second test
The cost redundant restraint method like seat belt quite low economically term weight space pas third test
Therefore adding seat belt vehicle excellent idea
Other supplemental restraint system expensive pas test smaller margin
Another excellent example principle put practice braking system whilst actual brake mechanism critical particularly prone sudden rather progressive failure case necessarily duplicated allow even balanced application brake force wheel
It would also prohibitively costly main component would add considerable weight
However similarly critical system actuating brake driver control inherently le robust generally using cable rust stretch jam snap hydraulic fluid leak boil develop bubble absorb water thus lose effectiveness
Thus modern car footbrake hydraulic brake circuit diagonally divided give two smaller point failure loss either reducing brake power causing much dangerous brakeforce imbalance straight split hydraulic circuit fail completely relatively rare occurrence failsafe form parking brake operates otherwise relatively weak rear brake still bring vehicle safe halt conjunction braking long demand line normal traffic flow
The culmulatively unlikely combination total footbrake failure need harsh braking emergency likely result collision still one lower speed would otherwise case
In comparison footpedal activated service brake parking brake le critical item unless used backup footbrake cause immediate danger found nonfunctional moment application
Therefore redundancy built per se typically us cheaper lighter le hardwearing cable actuation system suffice happens hill use footbrake momentarily hold vehicle still driving find flat piece road stop
Alternatively shallow gradient transmission shifted Park Reverse First gear transmission lock engine compression used hold stationary need include sophistication first bring halt
On motorcycle similar level provided simpler method firstly front rear brake system entirely separate regardless method activation cable rod hydraulic allowing one fail entirely whilst leaving unaffected
Secondly rear brake relatively strong compared automotive cousin even powerful disc sport model even though usual intent front system provide vast majority braking force overall vehicle weight central rear tyre generally larger grippier rider lean back put weight therefore allowing brake force applied wheel lock
On cheaper slower machine even front wheel use hydraulic disc extra brake force easier packaging rear usually primitive somewhat inefficient exceptionally robust drum thanks ease connecting footpedal wheel way importantly near impossibility catastrophic failure even rest machine like lot bike first year use point collapse neglected maintenance
The basic characteristic fault tolerance require In addition system characterized term planned service outage unplanned service outage
These usually measured application level hardware level
The figure merit called expressed percentage
For example system would statistically provide availability
system typically based concept redundancy
Spare component address first fundamental characteristic fault tolerance three way All implementation except RAID example us
A machine us replicated element operating parallel
At time replication element state
The input provided output expected
The output replication compared using voting circuit
A machine two replication element termed DMR
The voting circuit detect mismatch recovery relies method
A machine three replication element termed TMR
The voting circuit determine replication error vote observed
In case voting circuit output correct result discard erroneous version
After internal state erroneous replication assumed different two voting circuit switch DMR mode
This model applied larger number replication
machine easily made fully gate replication making state transition edge clock clock replication exactly phase
However possible build lockstep system without requirement
Bringing replication synchrony requires making internal stored state
They started fixed initial state reset state
Alternatively internal state one replica copied another replica
One variant DMR
Two replicated element operate lockstep pair voting circuit detects mismatch operation output signal indicating error
Another pair operates exactly way
A final circuit selects output pair proclaim error
requires four replica rather three TMR used commercially
design advantage obvious many disadvantage Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires broken part taken replaced new part system still operational computing known
Such system implemented single backup known represents vast majority system
In system long enough operator time fix broken device backup also fails
It help time failure long possible specifically required system
Fault tolerance notably successful computer application
built entire business machine used tolerance create system measured year
architecture may encompass also computer software example process
Data format may also designed degrade gracefully
example designed allowing new HTML entity ignored understand without causing document unusable
There difference fault tolerance system rarely problem
For instance system failure rate two hour per forty year therefore highly
But fault occur still stopped operating completely therefore

As programming naturally encounter lot error
Causing understanding fixing error important part programming
Python best run anything tell run ca understand asking wo run program
All Python try tell little bit information went wrong order help try fix
Here two Python error
In first example forget use parenthesis required
Python understand trying
Here second example bug Python
In second example forget define variable
Python know want since defined error occurs
A happens Python ca understand saying
A happens Python understands saying run trouble following instruction
In English would like sentence The grammar sentence make sense
From perspective English grammar missing action
You understand asked
mean thing
In English would like sentence The sentence make sense grammatical perspective verb noun right place know asked
But encounter problem start trying eat piano except maybe termite
This called occurs program start running
We also talk end mean program run without crashing still produce wrong result
An example would This would logic error also open even though command make sense close back door actually accomplish goal keeping bug since still come front door
Here additional example syntax error occur Python
One general thing occur Python encounter special symbol place expect
Python say point exclamation point
The problem meaning Python
The syntax error would go away put instead Python would understand part text
Here another syntax error subtle
The problem special word Python
written instead class would fine
Click see list special keywords Python
If using quote around text forget second one using parenthesis forget second one get syntax error In error short nd f ine Python expected another line ended found
Similarly short nd f ile Python kept looking program file ended found
Sometimes two similar syntax error give two different error message
But every error message indeed trying tell something helpful
Here common error
Python able understand program say run problem actually performing instruction
You find way producing error learn Python
Your program might run without crashing syntax error still wrong thing
For example perhaps want program calculate two number average defined Why program work
The average program print instead
The error time order operation arithmetic
When write mathematical meaning
To fix problem third line program written make clear Python really want value add first divide afterwards
You logic error program incorrectly write code follows design correctly like example
Logic error difficult spot especially longer program get better writing code also get better avoiding logic error
Lesson give tip avoiding logic error
Now lesson complete three exercise fixing error program
You try spot error running program run first use Python response determine need fixing
Once squashed bug move next lesson

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
There different type error prevent computer program working way
Three key error type
Runtime error error cause program computer crash even appears nothing wrong program code
Running often cause runtime error
This could written wrong order
Syntax error mistake way code written
program syntactically correct
Common syntax error include spelling mistake incorrect use punctuation use capital letter
This piece code designed add two number together display result There four syntax error
Can identify
The syntax error The syntactically correct code would Semantic error logical error program work produce different result designed expected
A program semantic error without error reported
This code contains semantic error
The program run obvious problem see output result
The first two line ask user suggest number value
However function return data type
If user give value first second number stored string
When add two string together eg answer
Adding together produce answer
If try program valid program error work first time
However would notice unexpected result
The correct code would require value set
However integer need output string along rest outputted message
The correct code Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

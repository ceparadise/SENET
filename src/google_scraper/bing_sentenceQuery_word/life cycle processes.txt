The system development lifecycle concept applies range hardware software configuration system composed hardware software combination
A system development life cycle composed number clearly defined distinct work phase used system engineer system developer plan design build test deliver
Like anything manufactured assembly line SDLC aim produce system meet exceed customer expectation based customer requirement delivering system move clearly defined phase within scheduled time frame cost estimate
Computer system complex often especially recent rise link multiple traditional system potentially supplied different software vendor
To manage level complexity number SDLC model methodology created synchronize stabilize
SDLC described along spectrum agile iterative sequential methodology
Agile methodology focus lightweight process allow rapid change without necessarily following pattern SDLC approach along development cycle
methodology focus limited project scope expanding improving product multiple iteration
Sequential BDUF model waterfall focus complete correct planning guide large project risk successful predictable result
Other model tend focus form development guided project scope adaptive iteration feature development
In project defined PLC SDLC slightly different activity occur
According Taylor project life cycle encompasses activity system development life cycle focus realizing product
SDLC used development IT project describes different stage involved project drawing board completion project
The SDLC methodology per se rather description phase life cycle software application
These phase broadly speaking investigation analysis design build test implement maintenance support
All software development methodology commonly known waterfall scrum methodology follow SDLC phase method varies vastly methodology
In Scrum methodology example one could say single user story go phase SDLC within single sprint
Contrast waterfall methodology another example every business requirement recorded analysis phase SDLC document called Business Requirements Specification translated description recorded design phase document called Functional Specification built one go collection solution feature typically period three nine month
These methodology obviously quite different approach yet contain SDLC phase requirement born travel life cycle phase ending final phase maintenance support typically whole life cycle start subsequent version software application
The describes process building information system deliberate structured methodical way reiterating stage product life
The system development life cycle according Elliott Strachan Radford originated develop large scale functional age large scale
Information system activity revolved around heavy routine
Several system development framework partly based SDLC SSADM produced UK government
Ever since according Elliott traditional life cycle approach system development increasingly replaced alternative approach framework attempted overcome inherent deficiency traditional SDLC
The system development life cycle framework provides sequence activity system designer developer follow
It consists set step phase phase SDLC us result previous one
The SDLC adheres important phase essential developer explained section
It includes evaluation present system information gathering feasibility study request approval
A number SDLC model created waterfall fountain spiral build fix rapid prototyping incremental synchronize stabilize
The oldest best known waterfall model sequence stage output stage becomes input next
These stage characterized divided different way including following In following diagram stage system development life cycle divided ten step definition creation modification IT work product Not every project require phase sequentially executed
However phase interdependent
Depending upon size complexity project phase may combined may overlap
The system investigates IT proposal
During step must consider current priority would affected handled
Before system planning done conducted determine creating new improved system viable solution
This help determine cost benefit resource requirement specific user need required completion
The development process continue management approves recommendation feasibility study
Following different component feasibility study The goal determine problem attempt fix system
This step involves system different piece analyze situation analyzing project goal breaking need created attempting engage user definite requirement defined
In design function operation described detail including screen layout business rule process diagram documentation
The output stage describe new system collection module subsystem
The design stage take initial input requirement identified approved requirement document
For requirement set one design element produced result interview workshop prototype effort
Design element describe desired system feature detail generally include functional hierarchy diagram screen layout diagram table business rule business process diagram complete diagram full data dictionary
These design element intended describe system sufficient detail skilled developer engineer may develop deliver system minimal additional input design
Environments controlled area system developer build distribute install configure test execute system move SDLC
Each environment aligned different area SDLC intended specific purpose
Examples environment include The code tested various level
Unit system user acceptance testing often performed
This grey area many different opinion exist stage testing much iteration occurs
Iteration generally part waterfall model mean rectify defect validate fix prior deployment incorporated phase
The following type testing may relevant depending type system development Once system stabilized adequate testing SDLC ensures proper training system performed documented transitioning system support staff end user
Training usually cover operational training people responsible supporting system well training end user using system delivery production operating environment
After training successfully completed system engineer developer transition system final production environment intended used end user supported support operation staff
The system includes change enhancement decommissioning sunset system
system important aspect SDLC
As key personnel change position organization new change implemented
There two approach system development traditional approach structured
Information Engineering includes traditional system approach also called structured analysis design technique
The object oriented approach view information system collection object integrated make full complete information system
The final phase SDLC measure effectiveness system evaluate potential enhancement
The process developing information system IS effectively use hardware software data process people support company business objective
System analysis design considered activity serf set stage bound problem
SAD leveraged set correct balance among competing requirement functional analysis domain
System analysis design interacts strongly distributed enterprise architecture enterprise
Architecture business architecture relies heavily concept partitioning interface persona role modeling arrive system description
This high level description broken component module analyzed designed constructed separately integrated accomplish business goal
SDLC SAD cornerstone full life cycle product system planning
analysis OOA process analyzing task also known develop conceptual model used complete task
A typical OOA model would describe computer software could used satisfy set requirement
During analysis phase programmer might consider written requirement statement formal vision document interview stakeholder interested party
The task addressed might divided several subtasks domain representing different business technological area interest
Each subtask would analyzed separately
Implementation constraint system built considered analysis phase rather addressed design OOD
The conceptual model result OOA typically consist set one number
It may also include kind
The input design provided output
Realize output artifact need completely developed serve input design analysis design may occur parallel practice result one activity feed short feedback cycle iterative process
Both analysis design performed incrementally artifact continuously grown instead completely developed one shot
Some typical common type design analysis input artifact The SDLC phase serve programmatic guide project activity provide flexible consistent way conduct project depth matching scope project
Each SDLC phase objective described section key deliverable description recommended task summary related control objective effective management
It critical project manager establish monitor control objective SDLC phase executing project
Control objective help provide clear statement desired result purpose used throughout entire SDLC process
Control objective grouped major category domain relate SDLC phase shown figure
To manage control SDLC initiative project required establish degree WBS capture schedule work necessary complete project
The WBS programmatic material kept project description section project notebook
The WBS format mostly left project manager establish way best describes project work
There key area must defined WBS part SDLC policy
The following diagram describes three key area addressed WBS manner established project manager
The diagram show coverage span numerous phase SDLC associated MCD subset primary mapping SDLC phase
For example Analysis Design primarily performed part Acquisition Implementation Domain System Build Prototype primarily performed part delivery support
The upper section work breakdown structure WBS identify major phase milestone project summary fashion
In addition upper section provide overview full scope timeline project part initial project description effort leading project approval
The middle section WBS based seven system development life cycle phase guide WBS task development
The WBS element consist milestone task opposed activity definitive period usually two week
Each task must measurable output
document decision analysis
A WBS task may rely one activity
software engineering system engineering may require close coordination task either internal external project
Any part project needing support contractor SOW written include appropriate task SDLC phase
The development SOW occur specific phase SDLC developed include work SDLC process may conducted external resource contractor
Baselines important part system development life cycle
These baseline established four five phase SDLC critical iterative nature model
Each baseline considered milestone SDLC
Complementary system development life cycle Few people modern computing world would use strict waterfall model SDLC many modern methodology superseded thinking
Some argue SDLC longer applies model like Agile computing still term widely use technology circle
The SDLC practice advantage traditional model system development lends structured environment
The disadvantage using SDLC methodology need iterative development
web development stakeholder need review regular basis software designed
Instead viewing SDLC strength weakness perspective far important take best practice SDLC model apply whatever may appropriate software designed
A comparison strength weakness SDLC An alternative SDLC rapid application development combine prototyping joint application development implementation CASE tool
The advantage RAD speed reduced development cost active user involvement development process

The system life cycle broken five stage Analysis Design Implementation Operation Maintenance
Gathering data essential analysis stage gain clear insight problem
If problem identified correctly poor solution guaranteed follow
A requirement specification contains system able done
This include A feasibility report produced analysis design stage
It include There number different way problem solved without using computer
One consideration must take account input output solution
The software could one three type Systems usually go several stage testing
Alpha testing first stage asmall group qualified individual examine early version program
Beta testing program fully featured released wider audience testing
Test data also used make sure program output expected data
We test program A new system implemented one following three way Proper maintenance system essential clear documentation begin help progress programmer need work hard understand design decision explained documentation
This reduces cost maintanence
Periodic review performance review use data collection technique seen analysis section indicate whether improvement modification needed

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

Nowadays system big complex team architect analyst programmer tester user must work together create million line code drive enterprise
More To manage number system development life cycle SDLC model created waterfall fountain spiral build fix rapid prototyping incremental synchronize stabilize
The oldest best known waterfall sequence stage output stage becomes input next
These stage characterized divided different way including following The waterfall model well understood useful
In Information Center Quarterly article Larry Runge say SDLC work well automating activity clerk accountant
It work nearly well building system knowledge worker people help desk expert trying solve problem executive trying lead company Fortune
Another problem waterfall model assumes role user specifying requirement requirement specified advance
Unfortunately requirement grow change throughout process beyond calling considerable feedback iterative consultation
Thus many SDLC model developed
The fountain model recognizes although activity ca start others need design start coding considerable overlap activity throughout development cycle
The spiral model emphasizes need go back reiterate earlier stage number time project progress
It actually series short waterfall cycle producing early prototype representing part entire project
This approach help demonstrate proof concept early cycle accurately reflects disorderly even chaotic evolution technology
Build fix crudest method
Write code keep modifying customer happy
Without planning risky
In rapid prototyping sometimes called rapid application development model initial emphasis creating prototype look act like desired product order test usefulness
The prototype essential part requirement determination phase may created using tool different used final product
Once prototype approved discarded real software written
The incremental model divide product build section project created tested separately
This approach likely find error user requirement quickly since user feedback solicited stage code tested sooner written
The synchronize stabilize method combine advantage spiral model technology overseeing managing source code
This method allows many team work efficiently parallel
This approach defined David Yoffie Harvard University Michael Cusumano MIT
They studied Microsoft developed Internet Explorer Netscape Communications developed Communicator finding common thread way two company worked
For example company nightly compilation called build entire project bringing together current component
They established release date expended considerable effort stabilize code released
The company alpha release internal testing one beta release usually wider testing outside company finally release candidate leading gold master released manufacturing
At point release specification would frozen remaining time spent fixing bug
Both Microsoft Netscape managed million line code specification changed evolved time
Design review strategy session frequent everything documented
Both company built contingency time schedule release deadline got close chose scale back product feature rather let milestone date slip

Most computer chip primarily composed crystalline silicon
The first step therefore silicon mining purification
Among many thing requires energy
Energy one input mining purifying process
The output purified silicon get shipped computer chip factory
The computer chip factory take purified silicon make crystal wafer form
The purified silicon input manufacturing process
Only pure silicon crystal used process becomes part chip
The silicon end chip either come recyclable output waste
Of silicon end part chip used make solar panel rest either disposed recycled back system
If waste used input different process solar panel manufacture case recycled material actually wasted
This one way industrial ecologist try reduce waste identify process actually use process waste input
Then factory etches circuit silicon wafer clean etched wafer place transistor circuit chip
The input process among thing chemical etch silicon water flush
For memory chip plastic package pound water used Williams et al
The water used process must purified used
It used wash silicon wafer passed system waste effluent
This effluent contains chemical washed wafer therefore disposed according federal state regulation
About pound chemical used pound chip produced time weight chip
Finally factory cut wafer actual chip packaged form ready assembling product
Through every step production process energy required input
The silicon crystal used must extremely pure since tiniest impurity cause chip fail
Creating absolute clean environment required produce pure substance
It calculated equivalent pound fossil fuel used production memory chip packaging electricity generated fossil fuel particularly coal
Energy one important input manufacturing process
To get full picture impact product manufacture necessary follow entire chain input output upstream downstream
To manufacture computer chip input output process required produce supply energy silicon including mining material
input output process produce crystalline silicon including crystallization purified liquid silicon
input output process manufacture chip including etching circuit silicon wafer
input output process produce final packaged chip including plastic ceramic case metal pin encases chip
This beginning life computer chip
Once put electronic device turned chip consumes electricity energy
When device chip outlived usefulness chip disposed either waste recycled material
This disposal phase chip last phase life cycle
Computer chip high environmental impact relative weight
For every gram microchip gram fossil fuel used whereas every gram automobile gram fossil fuel used
This due fact making pure organized hence low entropy structure high entropy material require large energy input
Automobiles made heavy material require level purity sophistication material microchip
The energy used producing nine ten computer enough produce automobile
This website presented Intel Innovation Education website describes computer chip manufactured
This research article report push develop faster semiconductor
By altering acidity composition chemical used etch chip researcher hope minimize roughness silicon wafer surface
The smoother surface faster chip processing speed

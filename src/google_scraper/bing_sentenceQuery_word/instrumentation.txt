This question already answer As title suggests
Many explanation really vague anyone provide solid definition
The term used lot Android testing I think restricted platform
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Some performance measurement tool add instrumentation code

may binary translate add instruction read timer beginning end function
Or instrumentation reading timer may added assembly C code automated tool programmer
Other performance measurement tool change code measured

UNIX prof sampling run special code invoked timer interrupt generates histogram instruction interrupt received
Some tool hybrid
UNIX gprof combine interrupt sampling mcount instrumentation added compiler option count function call
All performance measurement overhead instrumentation tends overhead interrupt based sampling
On hand instrumentation measure stuff
Well I said In context computer programming Programmers implement instrumentation form code instruction monitor specific component system example instruction may output logging information appear screen
When application contains instrumentation code managed using management tool
Instrumentation necessary review performance application
Instrumentation approach two type source instrumentation binary instrumentation
Happy coding Instrumentation usually used dynamic code analysis
It differs logging instrumentation usually done automatically software logging need human intelligence insert logging code
According Instrumentation addition method purpose gathering data utilized tool
Since change purely additive tool modify application state behavior
Examples benign tool include monitoring agent profilers coverage analyzer event logger

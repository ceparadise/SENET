The Computer Science Honours program demanding specialized Computer Science Major program
The minimum Faculty Science requirement rather credit graduation
In addition promoted within program Honours student student must take least credit winter session least credit school term program maintain average least credit
The Honours curriculum includes course leading towards thorough understanding fundamental Computer Science
The student still freedom choose course outside Department though choice inevitably limited Major program
An Honours program especially suitable preparation graduate study
Students interested registering Honours Program Computer Science required consult Department Advisor either applying shortly admitted
To eligible honour program student must complete least credit first year program average average course
Students considering Honours Program consider taking one intensive version first year course Physics Mathematics
Combined Honours program especially demanding especially valuable good student seek breadth well depth
Students interested registering Combined Honours Programs Computer Science required consult Department Advisor either applying shortly admitted
To eligible honour program student must complete least credit first year program average
In addition promoted within program Honours student student must take least credit winter session least credit school term program maintain average least credit
Students considering Honours Program consider taking one intensive version first year course Physics Mathematics
Unlike Bachelor Computer Science ICS program upon graduation program student receive Bachelor Science degree
To earn second Bachelor degree need satisfy two broad condition
You must course meet requirement degree seek already met previous study must complete additional credit must level
For detailed information please consult Department Advisor
Please note Second Degree student eligible Honours program
Students wishing undertake Double Major Faculty Science BSc Major Computer Science another Science specialization Arts BA Major Computer Science another Arts specialization may permission advisor home faculty advisor department
Unlike Combined Major program student enrolling Double Major required complete program requirement subject area
In case take longer four year complete Double Major
Students wish bridge Faculties BSc major Computer Science BA major Arts specialization CPSC apply Dual Degree
Unlike Double Major officially one degree Dual Major Arts Science two degree however requires completion Arts program requirement Science requirement
An Arts student example would need pick required BIOL CHEM MATH PHYS etc
course
Science student wish take Minor Computer Science must obtain approval advisor Faculty Science well advisor Major Minor subject area
Entry continuation Minor option requires student remains good academic standing
If Science student wish Minor approved recognized Department Computer Science thus gain priority CPSC wait list need apply department faculty office
The GPA entrance requirement used Minors Computer Science Computer Science degree specialization Majors Combined Majors includes Cognitive Systems Majors Computational Intelligence Option
The reason use GPA standard Minor take almost many department resource Major Combined Major
For example Minor student take CPSC course CPSC course
Thus typical Minor might take CPSC course
A typical Major take CPSC course
A typical Combined Major take CPSC course
Students faculty program student Minor without formal approval Computer Science department get priority CPSC waiting list
Such student need compete general seat CPSC course like student would priority determined according student registered waiting list
Thus back door CPSC course
Note student considering minor guarantee seat CPSC course
Because relatively small difference number CPSC credit needed complete Minor Combined Major Major student wish pursue CPSC Minor consider whether CPSC Combined Major example might appropriate academic goal
However faculty offer Combined Majors
Note requirement apply equally student department faculty wanting take Minor Computer Science student Computer Science program wanting Minor another discipline
Note A recent addition list Minors Computer Science one offered student Applied Science
The Software Engineering Option available student either Major Honours program available combined degree COGS Arts
This option offer coherent set course pertaining software engineering provide student necessary knowledge skill successful software development career
Interested student apply spring second year
Seats limited GPA minimum required
You find find
Education supplement classroom learning integrating work term degree program allow student apply knowledge work research environment
Students required take degree requirement determined choice academic program however addition work term add one full year undergraduate degree
Please see detail
Major Honours Combined Major Combined Honours etc
program includes Cognitive Systems Computational Intelligence program Minor officially admitted CPSC department wish switch another Computer Science specialization make appointment see CPSC advisor
Depending number kind course taken required new specialization may possible make change rather waiting Computer Science admission application processed
This already admitted Computer Science specialization get Computer Science
In case combined degree involving CPSC another department please note department limited number seat even Computer Science decides admit department may
Furthermore department process application per year usually May intake Winter Session Term grade released
need apply get Computer Science
Follow normal application procedure admission listed Web page
The GPA admission Computer Science degree specialization highly dependent number applicant number seat available GPAs applicant
Admission highly competitive
Unfortunately Department make promise admission student notified
Due large number current student applicant request mention wait list advising team often backlogged best
Please patient
All Science student finishing first year must apply Faculty Science choose specialization Computer Science second year
student plan enter Computer Science Faculty Science need apply Faculty Science
Similarly student accepted BSc program second degree wish CPSC specialization go Faculty Science process applying CPSC
Please consult Faculty Science Web page application deadline
Admission Faculty Science Computer Science competitive guaranteed
Furthermore may possible switch faculty many completed credit GPA low
Science student currently degree specialization CHEM STAT BIOL etc
wish switch CPSC specialization apply Department Computer Science instead Faculty Science
Application deadline usually month visit Web page respective application deadline

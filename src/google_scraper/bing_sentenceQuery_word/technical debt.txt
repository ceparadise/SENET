Technical debt concept programming reflects extra development work arises code easy implement short run used instead applying best overall solution
Technical debt commonly associated extreme programming especially context refactoring
That implies restructuring existing code refactoring required part development process
Under line thinking refactoring result poorly written code also done based evolving understanding problem best way solve problem
Technical debt may also known design debt
The term coined Ward Cunningham programmer also known developing first debt metaphor equates software development financial debt
Imagine project two potential option
One quick easy require modification future
The better design take time implement
In development releasing code quick easy approach like incurring debt come obligation interest technical debt come form extra work future
Taking time refactor equivalent paying principal
While take time short run also decrease future interest payment
Ward Cunningham describes concept follows The concept mean debt never incurred
Just leverage help company used correctly quick solution mean faster time market software development
In addition technical debt poor code
Bad code bad code technical debt result work good programmer unrealistic project constraint

Wondering
If ever designed large computer program commissioned custom software engaged heated conversation IT department probably come across term
What
Why keep coming
Technical debt describes consequence implementing partial quick software development solution instead yet effective solution
Managing technical debt well task requires wisdom balance behalf developer organization
The debt metaphor trace back Ward Cunningham American computer programmer developed first wiki among many important achievement
In Wyatt Software OOPSLA conference Cunningham wrote serious pitfall software development failure At time writing report Cunningham developing portfolio management system
Financial debt likely mind
He elaborated report Although immature code may work fine completely acceptable customer excess quantity immature code lead inflexible product
Shipping first time code like going debt
A little debt speed development long paid back promptly
The danger occurs debt repaid
Every minute spent code count interest debt
Entire engineering organization brought debt load unconsolidated Since report community embraced technical debt analogy explain software project never really done
Intentional unintentional technical debt pile team improve update software
And technical debt accumulates earns interest
Software developer learned use technical debt advantage
For example developer may apply code launch revisit code later make robust
While creating new feature team often develop best practice render former feature outdated
Developers pay debt aligning old feature current best practice
Teams manage technical debt even updating entire product meet new coding practice
The beauty Cunningham metaphor longer sit technical debt kind expensive fix
And avoiding loan payment long result serious repercussion avoiding paying technical debt
A classic example huge potential impact technical debt crisis
The decision define year last two digit remarkable early decade computer processing price digital storage still astronomical
But civilization reached brink new century program still unable distinguish
Over billion spent worldwide fix problem late
By many estimate cost would significantly lower
There ample opportunity man named Bob Bemer first called attention problem back
Talk lesson managing technical debt
In Cunningham revisited metaphor cleared frequent misunderstanding term
He explained technical debt bad first
A loan help buy house start business
Similarly incurring technical loan rushing software door smart choice
But good idea make time refactor update program near future
Accusing many blogger misstating important detail also clarified technical debt never excuse bad programming
In Cunningham word I never favor writing code poorly I favor writing code reflect current understanding problem even understanding In word technical debt excuse sloppy
Rather intentional technical debt allows complete first draft work tested reviewed order make second draft even stronger
Cunningham description technical debt grew one first extreme programming environment
Back Wyatt Software experimenting method programming allowed software project adapt discovery made development process
It revolutionary approach created better software faster letting learning drive direction development
Extreme programming grandfather workflow process like Agile Scrum
We use Praxent
Whereas waterfall workflow requires team complete entire iteration responding accrued debt dynamic workflow allow developer pay back back continuously small increment
In keeping metaphor continuous payment help keep interest low allow team take full advantage loan
More two decade Cunningham first introduced analogy concept technical debt finally becoming mainstream
Now entire workshop conference website dedicated technical debt diagnostics best practice
Other top developer coined term branching metaphorical tree like deficit programming Enron developing technical inflation explain need constantly revisit update code
When come development project seeing team plan budget technical debt
Even executive minimal programming knowledge beginning accept software living system maintained adapted time
As art science software development evolves new coding practice continue roll accelerated pace
Each new best practice improves software programming environment software developed
Perhaps developer business leader experiencing greater awareness concept surrounding technical debt
As programming undergoes continuous frequent change project face need pay technical debt order keep software current
Just financial loan help buy right house start lucrative business technical debt friendly
But vigilant loan payment technical debt pull

The Technical Debt constitutes metaphor coined Cunningham explains correlation software development financial debt
The extra work necessary held future discussed aiming improve requirement readability complexity Cunningham resulting additional cost likely interest payment Allman Curtis Sappidi Szynkarski Fowler Klinger Tarr Wagstrom Williams Lim Taksande Seaman
Narrowing term refers acceleration velocity releasing software product might lead implication form tradeoff short value Nord Ozkaya Kruchten
The rework effect Technical Debt incurs range trivial one amendment change may affect whole system
Sterling mention lifecycle affect size Technical Debt
For instance agile software development process would create le Technical Debt waterfall model due flexible structure

In software development technical debt metaphor equating Extreme Programming incremental approach acquisition money loan
A monetary loan course paid back interest
In term software development payback requires developer program learn interacts application feature end user using using wish
Just monetary debt easily spiral control managed properly technical debt

In business metaphor often used illustrate concept organization end spending future addressing technical problem first present
The assumption organization chooses ignore course action know taken organization risk paying term time money damage organization reputation future
As time go effort go back address original problem may become complicated new development
Eventually problem may reach organization must decide whether honor original debt continue investing time effort fix problem
This decision made difficult something called emotional tendency human want continue investing something clearly working

also known concept reflects implied cost additional rework caused choosing easy solution instead using better approach would take longer
Technical debt compared monetary
If technical debt repaid accumulate making harder implement change later
Unaddressed technical debt increase
Technical debt necessarily bad thing sometimes technical debt required move project forward
On hand expert claim technical debt metaphor tends minimize impact result insufficient prioritization necessary work correct
As change started codebase often need make coordinated change time part codebase documentation
Required change completed considered debt must paid point future
Just like financial debt uncompleted change incur interest top interest making cumbersome build project
Although term used software development primarily also applied profession
Common cause technical debt include combination It useful differentiate type technical debt
In discussion blog Technical Debt Quadrant Fowler distinguishes four debt type based two dichotomous category first category second
Interest payment caused necessary local maintenance absence maintenance user project
Ongoing development project increase cost paying debt future
One pay debt simply completing uncompleted work
The buildup technical debt major cause project miss deadline
It difficult estimate exactly much work necessary pay debt
For change initiated uncertain amount uncompleted work committed project
The deadline missed project realizes uncompleted work debt time complete
To predictable release schedule development team limit amount work progress order keep amount uncompleted work debt small time
If enough work completed project present barrier submission project released still carry substantial amount technical debt
If software reach production risk implementing future refactors might address technical debt increase dramatically
Modifying production code carry risk outage actual financial loss possibly legal repercussion contract involve agreement SLA
For reason view carrying technical debt production almost time decrease deployment turned retired
As evolving program continually changed complexity reflecting deteriorating structure increase unless work done maintain reduce
While Law already indicated evolving program continually add complexity deteriorating structure unless work done maintain first drew comparison technical complexity experience report Shipping first time code like going debt
A little debt speed development long paid back promptly rewrite
The danger occurs debt repaid
Every minute spent code count debt
Entire engineering organization brought debt load unconsolidated implementation otherwise
In text present comparable argument concerning cost associated architectural negligence describes design debt
Activities might postponed include writing attending tackling compiler warning
Other instance technical debt include knowledge shared around organization code confusing modified easily
compare evolving city similar evolving system lack refactoring lead technical debt
The concept technical debt central understanding force weigh upon system often explains system stressed
In city repair infrastructure often delayed incremental change made rather bold one
So system
Users suffer consequence capricious complexity delayed improvement insufficient incremental change developer evolve system suffer sling arrow never able write quality code always trying catch
In postponing sending local change upstream project technical debt

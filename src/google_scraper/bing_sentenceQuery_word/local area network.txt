layout organizational hierarchy interconnected node computer network
Different network topology affect throughput reliability often critical
With many technology bus network single failure cause network fail entirely
In general interconnection robust network expensive install
Common layout Note physical layout node network may necessarily reflect network topology
As example network topology ring actually two ring physical topology often star neighboring connection routed via central physical location
An virtual computer network built top another network
Nodes overlay network connected virtual logical link
Each link corresponds path perhaps many physical link underlying network
The topology overlay network may often differ underlying one
For example many network overlay network
They organized node virtual system link run top Internet
Overlay network around since invention networking computer system connected telephone line using data network existed

A set rule exchanging information network
In also see protocol leverage service protocol
An important example protocol stack running protocol
This stack used home user personal computer user surfing web
While use protocol layering today ubiquitous across field computer networking historically criticized many researcher two principal reason
Firstly abstracting protocol stack way may cause higher layer duplicate functionality lower layer prime example error recovery basis basis
Secondly common protocol implementation one layer may require data state addressing information present another layer thus defeating point separating layer first place
For example us ECN field indication congestion IP protocol whereas TCP protocol
Communication protocol various characteristic
They may may use may use hierarchical addressing flat addressing
There many communication protocol described
family IEEE standard dealing local area network metropolitan area network
The complete IEEE protocol suite provides diverse set networking capability
The protocol flat addressing scheme

For example deal routing Ethernet packet using
describes defines protocol form basis authentication mechanism used VLANs also found WLANs home user see user enter wireless access key
sometimes simply called family protocol used wired LANs described set standard together called published
also widely known WLAN WiFi probably member protocol family home user today
It standarized share many property wired Ethernet
The also called foundation modern networking
It offer well service inherently unreliable network traversed transmission IP level
At core protocol suite defines addressing identification routing specification next generation protocol much enlarged addressing capability
SONET Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH standardized protocol transfer multiple digital bit stream optical fiber using laser
They originally designed transport circuit mode communication variety different source primarily support uncompressed voice encoded Modulation format
However due protocol neutrality feature also obvious choice transporting ATM frame
ATM switching technique telecommunication network
It us asynchronous encodes data small
This differs protocol use variable sized packet
ATM similarity switched networking
This make good choice network must handle traditional data traffic content voice video
ATM us model must established two endpoint actual data exchange begin
While role ATM diminishing favor still play role connection home user
There number different digital cellular standard including GSM GPRS EDGE UMTS DECT iDEN

A part computer network infrastructure provides path exchange information different LANs
A backbone tie together diverse network within building across different building wide area
For example large company might implement backbone network connect department located around world
The equipment tie together departmental network constitutes network backbone
When designing network backbone critical factor take account
Normally backbone network capacity greater individual network connected
Another example backbone network set WANs tie together network connected
A MAN large computer network usually span city large campus
A WAN computer network cover large geographic area city country span even intercontinental distance
A WAN us communication channel combine many type medium telephone line cable air wave
A WAN often make use transmission facility provided common carrier telephone company
WAN technology generally function lower three layer
An network single organization build interconnect office location production site head office remote office shop share computer resource
A VPN overlay network link node carried open connection virtual circuit larger network Internet instead physical wire
The data link layer protocol virtual network said tunneled larger network case
One common application secure communication public Internet VPN need explicit security feature authentication content encryption
VPNs example used separate traffic different user community underlying network strong security feature

They may also provide network access single owner permit virtually unlimited global connectivity
An set network control single administrative entity
The intranet us protocol tool web browser file transfer application
The administrative entity limit use intranet authorized user
Most commonly intranet internal LAN organization
A large intranet typically least one web server provide user organizational information
An intranet also anything behind router local area network
An network also administrative control single organization support limited connection specific external network
For example organization may provide access aspect intranet share data business partner customer
These entity necessarily trusted security standpoint
Network connection extranet often always implemented via WAN technology
An connection multiple computer network via common routing technology using router
The largest example internetwork
It global system interconnected governmental academic corporate public private computer network
It based networking technology
It successor ARPANET developed
The Internet also communication backbone underlying WWW
Participants Internet use diverse array method several hundred documented often standardized protocol compatible Internet Protocol Suite addressing system administered
Service provider large enterprise exchange information address space BGP forming redundant worldwide mesh transmission path
A overlay network typically running internet accessible specialized software
A darknet anonymizing network connection made trusted peer sometimes called friend using
Darknets distinct distributed network anonymous publicly shared therefore user communicate little fear governmental corporate interference
process selecting network path carry network traffic
Routing performed many kind network including network
In packet switched network routing directs transit logically addressed source toward ultimate destination intermediate
Intermediate node typically network hardware device
also forward packet perform routing though specialized hardware may suffer limited performance
The routing process usually directs forwarding basis maintain record route various network destination
Thus constructing routing table held router important efficient routing
There usually multiple route taken choose different element considered decide route get installed routing table sorted priority Most routing algorithm use one network path time
technique enable use multiple alternative path
Routing narrow sense term often contrasted assumption structured similar address imply proximity within network
Structured address allow single routing table entry represent route group device
In large network structured addressing routing narrow sense outperforms unstructured addressing bridging
Routing become dominant form addressing Internet
Bridging still widely used within localized environment
application hosted computer network member user network help network operate
The example network service
Network service DNS give name people remember name like better number like ensure equipment network valid IP address
Services usually based defines format sequencing message client server network service
Depending installation requirement usually measured telecommunication product
The parameter affect typically include
The following list give example network performance measure network one type viz
ATM There many way measure performance network network different nature design
Performance also modelled instead measured
For example often used model queuing performance network
The network planner us diagram analyze network performs state ensuring network optimally designed
occurs link node carrying much data deteriorates
Typical effect include new connection
A consequence latter two incremental increase lead either small increase network actual reduction network throughput
use aggressive compensate packet loss tend keep system state network initial load reduced level would normally induce network congestion
Thus network using protocol exhibit two stable state level load
The stable state low throughput known
Modern network use technique try avoid congestion collapse
These include protocol original reduction device
Another method avoid negative effect network congestion implementing priority scheme packet transmitted higher priority others
Priority scheme solve network congestion help alleviate effect congestion service
An example
A third method avoid network congestion explicit allocation network resource specific flow
One example use Transmission Opportunities CFTXOPs standard provides existing home wire power line phone line coaxial cable
